                            Vrihadaswa said. "Bhima's daughter, the cool-headed Damayanti, seeing the<br>righteous king maddened and deprived of his senses at dice, was filled, O<br>king, with alarm and grief. And she thought the affair to be a serious<br>one with the king. And apprehensive of the calamity that threatened Nala,<br>yet seeking his welfare and at last understanding that her lord had lost<br>everything, she said unto her nurse and maid-servant Vrihatsena of high<br>fame, intent upon her good, dexterous in all duties, faithful and<br>sweet-speeched, these words, 'O Vrihatsena, go thou and summon the<br>councillors in the name of Nala, and tell them also what of wealth and<br>other things hath been lost and what remaineth.' The councillors then,<br>hearing of Nala's summons, said, 'This is fortunate for us' and<br>approached the king. And when the subjects in a body had (thus) come a<br>second time, the daughter of Bhima informed Nala of it. But the king<br>regarded her not. Finding her husband disregarding her words, Damayanti,<br>filled with shame, returned to her apartments. And hearing that the dice<br>were uniformly unfavourable to the virtuous Nala, and that he had lost<br>everything, she again spake unto her nurse, saying, 'O Vrihatsena, go<br>thou again in Nala's name to bring hither, O blessed one, the charioteer,<br>Varshneya. The matter at hand is very serious.' And Vrihatsena, hearing<br>those words of Damayanti caused Varshneya to be summoned by trusty<br>servants. And the blameless daughter of Bhima, acquainted with conduct<br>suitable to time and place, addressing soft words said according to the<br>occasion, 'Thou knowest how the king hath always behaved towards thee. He<br>is now in difficulty, and it behoveth thee to assist him. The more the<br>king loseth to Pushkara, the greater becometh his ardour for the play.<br>And as the dice fall obedient to Pushkara, it is seen that they are<br>adverse to Nala in the matter of the play. And absorbed in the play, he<br>heedeth not the words of his friends and relatives, nor even those of<br>mine. I do not think, however, that in this the high-souled Naishadha is<br>to blame, in as much as the king regarded not my words, being absorbed in<br>play. O Charioteer, I seek thy protection. Do my behest. My mind<br>misgiveth me. The king may come to grief. Yoking Nala's favourite horses<br>endued with the fleetness of the mind, do thou take these twins (my son<br>and daughter) on the car and hie thou to Kundina. Leaving the children<br>there with my kindred as also the car and the horses, either stay thou<br>there, or go to any other place as it listeth thee.' Varshneya, the<br>charioteer of Nala, then reported in detail these words of Damayanti unto<br>the chief officers of the king. And having settled (the matter) in<br>consultation with them, and obtaining their assent, O mighty monarch, the<br>charioteer started for Vidarbha, taking the children on that car. And<br>leaving there the boy Indrasena and the girl Indrasena, as also that best<br>of cars and those steeds, the charioteer, with a sad heart grieving for<br>Nala, bade farewell unto Bhima. And wandering for some time, he arrived<br>at the city of Ayodhya. And there he appeared with a sorrowful heart<br>before king Rituparna, and entered the service of that monarch as<br>charioteer."
