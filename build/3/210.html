                            "Markandeya continued, 'O Bharata, the Brahmana, thus interrogated by the<br>virtuous fowler, resumed again this discourse so pleasing to the mind.<br>The Brahmana said, 'O best of the cherishers of religion, it is said that<br>there are five great elements; do thou describe to me in full the<br>properties of any one of the five.' The fowler replied, 'The earth,<br>water, fire, air and sky all have properties interlapping each other. I<br>shall describe them to thee. The earth, O Brahmana, has five qualities,<br>water four, fire three and the air and sky together three also. Sound,<br>touch, form, odour and taste&#8212;these five qualities belong to earth, and<br>sound, touch, form and taste, O austere Brahmana, have been described to<br>thee as the properties of water, and sound, touch and form are the three<br>properties of fire and air has two properties sound and touch, and sound<br>is the property of sky. And, O Brahmana, these fifteen properties<br>inherent in five elements, exist in all substances of which this universe<br>is composed. And they are not opposed to one another; they exist, O<br>Brahmana, in proper combination. When this whole universe is thrown into<br>a state of confusion, then every corporeal being in the fulness of time,<br>assumes another corpus. It arises and perishes in due order. And there<br>are present the five elementary substances of which all the mobile and<br>immobile world is composed. Whatever is perceptible by the senses, is<br>called vyakta (knowable or comprehensible) and whatever is beyond the<br>reach of the senses and can only be perceived by guesses, is known to be<br>avyakta (not vyakta). When a per on engages in the discipline of<br>self-examination, after having subdued the senses which have of their own<br>proper objective play in the external conditions of sound, form, &c, then<br>he beholds his own spirit pervading the universe, and the universe<br>reflected in itself. He who is wedded to his previous karma, although<br>skilled in the highest spiritual wisdom, is cognisant only of his soul's<br>objective existence, but the person whose soul is never affected by the<br>objective conditions around, is never subject to ills, owing to its<br>absorption in the elementary spirit of Brahma. When a person has overcome<br>the domination of illusion, his manly virtues consisting of the essence<br>of spiritual wisdom, turn to the spiritual enlightenment which illumines<br>the intelligence of sentient beings. Such a person is styled by the<br>omnipotent, intelligent Spirit as one who is without beginning and<br>without end, self-existent, immutable, incorporeal and incomparable.<br>This, O Brahmana, that thou hast enquired of me is only the result of<br>self discipline. And this self-discipline can only be acquired by<br>subduing the senses. It cannot be otherwise, heaven and hell are both<br>dependent on our senses. When subdued, they lead to heaven; when indulged<br>in, they lead to perdition. This subjugation of the senses is the highest<br>means of attaining spiritual light. Our senses are at the (cause) root of<br>our spiritual advancement as also at the root of our spiritual<br>degradation. By indulging in them, a person undoubtedly contracts vices,<br>and by subduing these, he attains salvation. The self-restrained person<br>who acquires mastery over the six senses inherent in our nature, is never<br>tainted with sin, and consequently evil has no power over him. Man's<br>corporeal self has been compared to a chariot, his soul to a charioteer<br>and his senses to horses. A dexterous man drives about without confusion,<br>like a quiet charioteer with well-broken horses. That man is an excellent<br>driver who knows how to patiently wield the reins of those wild<br>horses,&#8212;the six senses inherent in our nature. When our senses become<br>ungovernable like horses on the high road, we must patiently rein them<br>in; for with patience, we are sure to get the better of them. When a<br>man's mind is overpowered by any one of these senses running wild, he<br>loses his reason, and becomes like a ship tossed by storms upon the high<br>ocean. Men are deceived by illusion in hoping to reap the fruits of those<br>six things, whose effects are studied by persons of spiritual insight,<br>who thereby reap the fruits of their clear perception."
