                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O illustrious Vasudeva of mighty arms, tell thou in<br>detail of the death of the lord of Saubha. My curiosity hath not been<br>appeased by the narration.'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'O mighty-armed king, hearing that the son of Srutasravas<br>(Sisupala) had been slain by me, Salwa, O best of the Bharata race, came<br>to the city of Dwaravati! And, O son of Pandu, the wicked king,<br>stationing his forces in array, besieged that city around and above. And<br>stationing himself in the upper regions, the king began his fight with<br>the city. And that encounter commenced with a thick shower of weapons<br>from all sides. And, O bull of the Bharata race, the city at that time<br>was well-fortified on all sides, according to the science (of<br>fortification), with pennons, and arches, and combatants, and walls and<br>turrets, and engines, and miners, and streets barricaded with spiked<br>wood-works and towers and edifices with gate-ways well-filled with<br>provisions, and engines for hurling burning brands and fires, and<br>vessels, of deer-skins (for carrying water), and trumpets, tabors, and<br>drums, lances and forks, and Sataghnis, and plough-shares, rockets, balls<br>of stone and battle-axes and other weapons and shield embossed with iron,<br>and engines for hurling balls and bullets and hot liquids! And the city<br>was also well-defended by numerous cars, and, O tiger among Kurus, by<br>Gada and Shamva and Uddhava and others, and by warriors of prowess tried<br>in battle, all well-born and capable of encountering any foe! And these<br>all placing themselves on commanding posts, aided by cavalry and<br>standard-bearers, began to defend the town. And Ugrasena and Uddhava and<br>others, to prevent carelessness, Proclaimed throughout the city that<br>nobody should drink. And all the Vrishnis and the Andhakas, well-knowing<br>that they would be slain by Salwa if they behaved carelessly, remained<br>sober and watchful. And the police soon drove out of the city all mimes<br>and dancers and singers of the Anartta country. And all the bridges over<br>rivers were destroyed, and boats forbidden to ply, and the trenches<br>(around the city) were spiked with poles at the bottom. And the land<br>around the city for full two miles was rendered uneven, and holes and<br>pits were dug thereon, and combustibles were secreted below the surface.<br>Our fort, O sinless one, is naturally strong and always well-defended and<br>filled with all kinds of weapons! And in consequence of the preparations<br>made, our city was more prepared than ever to meet the foe. And, O chief<br>of the Bharatas, in consequence of all this, the city looked like that of<br>Indra himself. And, O king, at the time of Salwa's approach, nobody could<br>either enter or leave the town of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas without<br>presenting the sign that had been agreed upon. And all the streets of the<br>town and the open spaces were filled with numerous elephants and horses!<br>And, O thou of mighty arms, the combatants were all specially gratified<br>with allowances and wages, and rations, and weapons, and dresses! And<br>amongst the combatants there was none who was not paid in gold, and none<br>who was not paid at all, and none who was not somehow obliged, and none<br>who was not of tried valour! And, O thou of eyes like lotus-leaves, it<br>was thus Dwaraka, abounding in well-ordered arrangements, was defended by<br>Ahuka (Ugrasena)!'"
