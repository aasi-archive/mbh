                            Vaisampayana said, "Those soldiers then, O king, all went back to<br>Duryodhana and repeated to him every word that the Gandharvas had said.<br>And, O Bharata, finding that his soldiers had been opposed by the<br>Gandharvas, Dhritarashtra's son, endued with energy, was filled with<br>rage. And the king addressed his soldiers, saying, 'Punish these wretches<br>who desire to oppose my will, even if they have come hither to sport,<br>accompanied by all the celestials with him of a hundred sacrifices. And<br>hearing these words of Duryodhana, the sons and officers of Dhritarashtra<br>all endued with great strength, as also warriors by thousands, began to<br>arm themselves for battle. And filling the ten sides with loud leonine<br>roars and rushing at those Gandharvas that had been guarding the gates,<br>they entered the forest. And as the Kuru soldiers entered the forest,<br>other Gandharvas came up and forbade them to advance. And though gently<br>forbidden by the Gandharvas to advance, the Kuru soldiers, without<br>regarding them in the least, began to enter that mighty forest. And when<br>those rangers of the sky found that the warriors of Dhritarashtra along<br>with their king could not be stopped by words they all went to their king<br>Chitrasena and represented everything unto him. And when Chitrasena, the<br>king of the Gandharvas, came to know all this he became filled with rage,<br>alluding to the Kuru, and commanded his followers saying, 'Punish these<br>wretches of wicked behaviour.' And, O Bharata, when the Gandharvas were<br>so commanded by Chitrasena, they rushed weapons in hand, towards the<br>Dhritarashtra ranks. And beholding the Gandharvas impetuously rushing<br>towards them with upraised weapons, the Kuru warriors precipitously fled<br>in all directions at the very sight of Duryodhana. And beholding the Kuru<br>soldiers all flying from the field with their backs to the foe, the<br>heroic Radheya alone fled not. And seeing the mighty host of the<br>Gandharvas rushing towards him, Radheya checked them by a perfect shower<br>of arrows. And the Suta's son, owing to his extreme lightness of hand,<br>struck hundreds of Gandharvas with Kshurapras and arrows and Bhallas and<br>various weapons made of bones and steel. And that mighty warrior, causing<br>the heads of numerous Gandharvas to roll down within a short time, made<br>the ranks of Chitrasena to yell in anguish. And although they were<br>slaughtered in great numbers by Karna endued with great intelligence, yet<br>the Gandharvas returned to the charge by hundreds and thousands. And in<br>consequence of the swarms of Chitrasena's warriors rushing impetuously to<br>the field the earth itself became soon covered by the Gandharva host.<br>Then king Duryodhana, and Sakuni, the son of Suvala, and Dussasana, and<br>Vikarna, and other sons of Dhritarashtra, seated on cars the clatter of<br>whose wheels resembled the roars of Garuda, returned to the charge,<br>following the lead of Karna, and began to slaughter that host. And<br>desirous of supporting Karna, these princes invested the Gandharva army,<br>with a large number of cars and a strong body of horses. Then the whole<br>of the Gandharva host began to fight with the Kauravas. And the encounter<br>that took place between the contending hosts was fierce in the extreme<br>and might make one's hair stand on end. The Gandharvas, at last,<br>afflicted with the shafts of the Kuru army, seemed to be exhausted. And<br>the Kauravas beholding the Gandharvas so afflicted sent up a loud sound.<br><br>"And seeing the Gandharva host yielding to fear, the angry Chitrasena<br>sprang from his seat, resolved to exterminate the Kuru army. And<br>conversant with various modes of warfare, he waged on the fight, aided by<br>his weapons of illusion. And the Kaurava warriors were then all deprived<br>of their senses by the illusion of Chitrasena. And then, O Bharata, it<br>seemed that every warrior of the Kuru army was fallen upon and surrounded<br>by ten Gandharvas. And attacked with great vigour, the Kuru host was<br>greatly afflicted and struck with panic. O king, all of them that liked<br>to live, fled from the field. But while the entire Dhritarashtra host<br>broke and fled, Karna, that offspring of the Sun, stood there, O king,<br>immovable as a hill. Indeed, Duryodhana and Karna and Sakuni, the son of<br>Suvala, all fought with the Gandharvas, although every one of them was<br>much wounded and mangled in the encounter. All the Gandharvas then,<br>desirous of slaying Karna, rushed together by hundreds and thousands<br>towards Karna. And those mighty warriors, desirous of slaying the Suta's<br>son, surrounded him on all sides, with swords and battle-axes and spears.<br>And some cut down the yoke of his car, and some his flagstaff, and some<br>the shaft of his car, and some his horses, and some his charioteer. And<br>some cut down his umbrella and some the wooden fender round his car and<br>some the joints of his car. It was thus that many thousands of<br>Gandharvas, together attacking his car, broke it into minute fragments.<br>And while his car was thus attacked, Karna leaped therefrom with sword<br>and shield in hand, and mounting on Vikarna's car, urged the steeds for<br>saving himself."
