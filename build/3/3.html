                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Yudhishthira the son of Kunti, thus addressed by<br>Saunaka, approached his priest and in the midst of his brothers said,<br>'The Brahmanas versed in the Vedas are following me who am departing for<br>the forest. Afflicted with many calamities I am unable to support them. I<br>cannot abandon them, nor have I the power to offer them sustenance: Tell<br>me, O holy one, what should be done by me in such a pass.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'After reflecting for a moment seeking to find out<br>the (proper) course by his yoga powers, Dhaumya, that foremost of all<br>virtuous men, addressed Yudhishthira, in these words, 'In days of old,<br>all living beings that had been created were sorely afflicted with<br>hunger. And like a father (unto all of them), Savita (the sun) took<br>compassion upon them. And going first into the northern declension, the<br>sun drew up water by his rays, and coming back to the southern<br>declension, stayed over the earth, with his heat centered in himself. And<br>while the sun so stayed over the earth, the lord of the vegetable world<br>(the moon), converting the effects of the solar heat (vapours) into<br>clouds and pouring them down in the shape of water, caused plants to<br>spring up. Thus it is the sun himself, who, drenched by the lunar<br>influence, is transformed, upon the sprouting of seeds, into holy<br>vegetable furnished with the six tastes. And it is these which constitute<br>the food of all creatures upon the earth. Thus the food that supporteth<br>the lives of creatures is instinct with solar energy, and the sun is,<br>therefore, the father of all creatures. Do thou, hence, O Yudhishthira,<br>take refuge even in him. All illustrious monarchs of pure descent and<br>deeds are known to have delivered their people by practising high<br>asceticism. The great Karttavirya, and Vainya and Nahusha, had all, by<br>virtue of ascetic meditation preceded by vows, delivered their people<br>from heavy afflictions. Therefore, O virtuous one, as thou art purified<br>by the acts do thou likewise, entering upon a file of austerities. O<br>Bharata, virtuously support the regenerate ones.'<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'How did that bull among the Kurus, king Yudhishthira,<br>for the sake of the Brahmanas adore the sun of wonderful appearance?"<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Listen attentively, O king, purifying thyself and<br>withdrawing thy mind from every other thing. And, O king of kings,<br>appoint thou a time. I will tell thee everything in detail, And, O<br>illustrious one, listen to the one hundred and eight names (of the sun)<br>as they were disclosed of old by Dhaumya to the high-souled son of<br>Pritha. Dhaumya said, 'Surya, Aryaman, Bhaga, Twastri, Pusha, Arka,<br>Savitri. Ravi,<br><br>Gabhastimat, Aja, Kala, Mrityu, Dhatri, Prabhakara, Prithibi, Apa, Teja,<br>Kha, Vayu, the sole stay, Soma, Vrihaspati, Sukra, Budha, Angaraka,<br>Indra, Vivaswat, Diptanshu, Suchi, Sauri, Sanaichara, Brahma, Vishnu,<br>Rudra, Skanda, Vaisravana, Yama, Vaidyutagni, Jatharagni, Aindhna,<br>Tejasampati, Dharmadhwaja, Veda-karttri, Vedanga, Vedavahana, Krita,<br>Treta, Dwapara, Kali, full of every impurity, Kala, Kastha, Muhurtta,<br>Kshapa, Yama, and Kshana; Samvatsara-kara, Aswattha, Kalachakra,<br>Bibhavasu, Purusha, Saswata, Yogin, Vyaktavyakta, Sanatana, Kaladhyaksha,<br>Prajadhyaksha, Viswakarma, Tamounda, Varuna, Sagara, Ansu, Jimuta,<br>Jivana, Arihan, Bhutasraya, Bhutapati, Srastri, Samvartaka, Vanhi,<br>Sarvadi, Alolupa, Ananta, Kapila, Bhanu, Kamada, Sarvatomukha, Jaya,<br>Visala, Varada, Manas, Suparna, Bhutadi, Sighraga, Prandharana,<br>Dhanwantari, Dhumaketu, Adideva, Aditisuta, Dwadasatman, Aravindaksha,<br>Pitri, Matri, Pitamaha, Swarga-dwara, Prajadwara, Mokshadwara,<br>Tripistapa, Dehakarti, Prasantatman, Viswatman, Viswatomukha,<br>Characharatman, Sukhsmatman, the merciful Maitreya. These are the hundred<br>and eight names of Surya of immeasurable energy, as told by the<br>self-create (Brahma). For the acquisition of prosperity, I bow down to<br>thee, O Bhaskara, blazing like unto gold or fire, who is worshipped of<br>the gods and the Pitris and the Yakshas, and who is adored by Asuras,<br>Nisacharas, and Siddhas. He that with fixed attention reciteth this hymn<br>at sunrise, obtaineth wife and offspring and riches and the memory of his<br>former existence, and by reciting this hymn a person attaineth patience<br>and memory. Let a man concentrating his mind, recite this hymn. By doing<br>so, he shall be proof against grief and forest-fire and ocean and every<br>object of desire shall be his.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having heard from Dhaumya these words suitable<br>to the occasion, Yudhishthira the just, with heart concentrated within<br>itself and purifying it duly, became engaged in austere meditation, moved<br>by the desire of supporting the Brahmanas. And worshipping the maker of<br>day with offerings of flowers and other articles, the king performed his<br>ablutions. And standing in the stream, he turned his face towards the god<br>of day. And touching the water of the Ganges the virtuous Yudhishthira<br>with senses under complete control and depending upon air alone for his<br>sustenance, stood there with rapt soul engaged in pranayama.[7] And<br>having purified himself and restrained his speech, he began to sing the<br>hymn of praise (to the sun).'<br><br>'Yudhishthira said, "Thou art, O sun, the eye of the universe. Thou art<br>the soul of all corporeal existences. Thou art the origin of all things.<br>Thou art the embodiment of the acts of all religious men. Thou art the<br>refuge of those versed in the Sankhya philosophy (the mysteries of the<br>soul), and thou art the support of the Yogins. Thou art a door unfastened<br>with bolts. Thou art the refuge of those wishing for emancipation. Thou<br>sustainest and discoverest the world, and sanctifiest and supportest it<br>from pure compassion. Brahmanas versed in the Vedas appearing before<br>thee, adore thee in due time, reciting the hymns from the respective<br>branches (of the Vedas) they refer. Thou art the adored of the Rishis.<br>The Siddhas, and the Charanas and the Gandharvas and the Yakshas, and the<br>Guhyakas, and the Nagas, desirous of obtaining boons follow thy car<br>coursing through the skies. The thirty-three gods[8] with Upendra<br>(Vishnu) and Mahendra, and the order of Vaimanikas[9] have attained<br>success by worshipping thee. By offering thee garlands of the celestial<br>Mandaras[10] the best of the Vidyadharas have obtained all their desires.<br>The Guhyas and the seven orders of the Pitris&#8212;both divine and<br>human&#8212;have attained superiority by adoring thee alone. The Vasus, the<br>Manilas, and the Rudras, the Sadhyas, the Marichipas, the Valikhilyas,<br>and the Siddhas, have attained pre-eminence by bowing down unto thee.<br>There is nothing that I know in the entire seven worlds, including that<br>of Brahma which is beyond thee. There are other beings both great and<br>endued with energy; but none of them hath thy lustre and energy. All<br>light is in thee, indeed, thou art the lord of all light. In thee are the<br>(five) elements and all intelligence, and knowledge and asceticism and<br>the ascetic properties.[11] The discus by which the wielder of the<br>Saranga[12] humbleth the pride of Asuras and which is furnished with a<br>beautiful nave, was forged by Viswakarman with thy energy. In summer thou<br>drawest, by thy rays, moisture from all corporeal existences and plants<br>and liquid substances, and pourest it down in the rainy season. Thy rays<br>warm and scorch, and becoming as clouds roar and flash with lightning and<br>pour down showers when the season cometh. Neither fire nor shelter, nor<br>woolen cloths give greater comfort to one suffering from chilling blasts<br>than thy rays. Thou illuminest by thy rays the whole Earth with her<br>thirteen islands. Thou alone are engaged in the welfare of the three<br>worlds. If thou dost not rise, the universe becometh blind and the<br>learned cannot employ themselves in the attainment of virtue, wealth and<br>profit. It is through thy grace that the (three) orders of Brahmanas,<br>Kshatriyas and Vaisyas are able to perform their various duties and<br>sacrifices.[13] Those versed in chronology say that thou art the<br>beginning and thou the end of a day of Brahma, which consisteth of a full<br>thousand Yugas. Thou art the lord of Manus and of the sons of the Manus,<br>of the universe and of man, of the Manwantaras, and their lords. When the<br>time of universal dissolution cometh, the fire Samvartaka born of thy<br>wrath consumeth the three worlds and existeth alone And clouds of various<br>hues begotten of thy rays, accompanied by the elephant Airavata and the<br>thunderbolt, bring about the appointed deluges. And dividing thyself into<br>twelve parts and becoming as many suns, thou drinkest up the ocean once<br>more with thy rays. Thou art called Indra, thou art Vishnu, thou art<br>Brahma, thou art Prajapati. Thou art fire and thou art the subtle mind.<br>And thou art lord and the eternal Brahma. Thou art Hansa, thou art<br>Savitri, thou art Bhanu, Ansumalin, and Vrishakapi. Thou art Vivaswan,<br>Mihira, Pusha, Mitra, and Dharma. Thou art thousand-rayed, thou art<br>Aditya, and Tapana, and the lord of rays. Thou art Martanda, and Arka,<br>and Ravi, and Surya and Saranya and maker of day, and Divakara and<br>Suptasaspti, and Dhumakeshin and Virochana. Thou art spoken of as swift<br>of speed and the destroyer of darkness, and the possessor of yellow<br>steeds. He that reverentially adoreth thee on the sixth or the seventh<br>lunar day with humility and tranquillity of mind, obtaineth the grace of<br>Lakshmi. They that with undivided attention adore and worship thee, are<br>delivered from all dangers, agonies, and afflictions. And they that hold<br>that thou art everywhere (being the soul of all things) living long,<br>freed from sin and enjoying an immunity from all diseases. O lord of all<br>food, it behoveth thee to grant food in abundance unto me who am desirous<br>of food even for entertaining all my guests with reverence. I bow also to<br>all those followers of thine that have taken refuge at thy feet&#8212;Mathara<br>and Aruna and Danda and others, including Asani and Kshuva and the<br>others. And I bow also to the celestial mothers of all creatures, viz.,<br>Kshuva and Maitri and the others of the class. O, let them deliver me<br>their supplient.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Thus, O great king, was the sun that purifier of the<br>world, adored (by Yudhishthira). And pleased with the hymn, the maker of<br>day, self-luminous, and blazing like fire showed himself to the son of<br>Pandu. And Vivaswan said, 'Thou shall obtain all that thou desirest. I<br>shall provide thee with food for five and seven years together. And, O<br>king, accept this copper-vessel which I give unto thee. And, O thou of<br>excellent vows, as long as Panchali will hold this vessel, without<br>partaking of its contents fruits and roots and meat and vegetables cooked<br>in thy kitchen, these four kinds of food shall from this day be<br>inexhaustible. And, on the fourteenth year from this, thou shall regain<br>thy kingdom.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said this, the god vanished away. He<br>that, with the desire of obtaining a boon, reciteth this hymn<br>concentrating his mind with ascetic abstraction, obtaineth it from the<br>sun, however difficult of acquisition it may be that he asketh for. And<br>the person, male or female, that reciteth or heareth this hymn day after<br>day, if he or she desireth for a son, obtaineth one, and if riches,<br>obtaineth them, and if learning acquireth that too. And the person male<br>or female, that reciteth this hymn every day in the two twilights, if<br>overtaken by danger, is delivered from it, and if bound, is freed from<br>the bonds. Brahma himself had communicated this hymn to the illustrious<br>Sakra, and from Sakra was it obtained by Narada and from Narada, by<br>Dhaumya. And Yudhishthira, obtaining it from Dhaumya, attained all his<br>wishes. And it is by virtue of this hymn that one may always obtain<br>victory in war, and acquire immense wealth also. And it leadeth the<br>reciter from all sins, to the solar region.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having obtained the boon, the virtuous son of<br>Kunti, rising from the water, took hold of Dhaumya's feet and then<br>embraced his brother's. And, O exalted one, wending then with Draupadi to<br>the kitchen, and adored by her duly, the son of Pandu set himself to cook<br>(their day's) food. And the clean food, however little, that was dressed,<br>furnished with the four tastes, increased and became inexhaustible. And<br>with it Yudhishthira began to feed the regenerate ones. And after the<br>Brahmanas had been fed, and his younger brothers also, Yudhishthira<br>himself ate of the food that remained, and which is called Vighasa. And<br>after Yudhishthira had eaten, the daughter of Prishata took what<br>remained. And after she had taken her meal, the day's food became<br>exhausted.<br><br>'And having thus obtained the boon from the maker of day, the son of<br>Pandu, himself as resplendent as that celestial, began to entertain the<br>Brahmanas agreeably to their wishes. And obedient to their priest, the<br>sons of Pritha, on auspicious lunar days and constellations and<br>conjunctions, performed sacrifices according to the ordinance, the<br>scriptures, and the Mantras. After the sacrifices, the sons of Pandu,<br>blessed by the auspicious rites performed by Dhaumya and accompanied by<br>him, and surrounded also by the Brahmanas set out for the woods of<br>Kamyaka.'"
