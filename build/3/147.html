                            Hanuman said, 'And after his wife was carried away, that descendant of<br>Raghu, while searching with his brother for his queen, met, on the summit<br>of that mountain, with Sugriva, chief of the monkeys. Then a friendship<br>was contracted between him and the high-souled Raghava. And the latter,<br>having slain Vali installed Sugriva in the kingdom. And having obtained<br>the kingdom, Sugriva sent forth monkeys by hundreds and by thousands in<br>search of Sita. And, O best of men, I too with innumerable monkeys set<br>out towards the south in quest of Sita, O mighty-armed one. Then a mighty<br>vulture Sampati by name, communicated the tidings that Sita was in the<br>abode of Ravana. Thereupon with the object of securing success unto Rama,<br>I all of a sudden bounded over the main, extending for a hundred yojanas.<br>And, O chief of the Bharatas, having by my own prowess crossed the ocean,<br>that abode of sharks and crocodiles, I saw in Ravana's residence, the<br>daughter of king Janaka, Sita, like unto the daughter of a celestial. And<br>having interviewed that lady, Vaidehi, Rama's beloved, and burnt the<br>whole of Lanka with its towers and ramparts and gates, and proclaimed my<br>name there, I returned. Hearing everything from me the lotus-eyed Rama at<br>once ascertained his course of action, and having for the passage of his<br>army constructed a bridge across the deep, crossed it followed by myriads<br>of monkeys. Then by prowess Rama slew those Rakshasas in battle, and also<br>Ravana, the oppressor of the worlds together with his Rakshasa followers.<br>And having slain the king of the Rakshasas, with his brother, and sons<br>and kindred, he installed in the kingdom in Lanka the Rakshasa chief,<br>Vibhishana, pious, and reverent, and kind to devoted dependants. Then<br>Rama recovered his wife even like the lost Vaidic revelation. Then<br>Raghu's son, Rama, with his devoted wife, returned to his own city,<br>Ayodhya, inaccessible to enemies; and that lord of men began to dwell<br>there. Then that foremost of kings, Rama was established in the kingdom.<br>Thereafter, I asked a boon of the lotus-eyed Rama, saying, 'O slayer of<br>foes, Rama, may I live as long as the history of thy deeds remaineth<br>extant on earth!" Thereupon he said, 'So be it. O represser of foes, O<br>Bhima, through the grace of Sita also, here all excellent objects of<br>entertainment are supplied to me, whoever abide at this place. Rama<br>reigned for the thousand and ten hundred years. Then he ascended to his<br>own abode. Ever since, here Apsaras and Gandharvas delight me, singing<br>for aye the deeds of that hero, O sinless one. O son of the Kurus, this<br>path is impassable to mortals. For this, O Bharata, as also with the view<br>that none might defeat or curse thee, have I obstructed thy passage to<br>this path trod by the immortals. This is one of the paths to heaven, for<br>the celestials; mortals cannot pass this way. But the lake in search of<br>which thou hast come, lieth even in that direction."
