                            "Markandeya continued, 'Hear, O king Yudhishthira what the virtuous<br>fowler, thus interrogated by that Brahmana, said to him in reply. The<br>fowler said, 'Men's minds are at first bent on the acquisition of<br>knowledge. That acquired, O good Brahmana, they indulge in their passions<br>and desires, and for that end, they labour and set about tasks of great<br>magnitude and indulge in much-desired pleasures of beauty, flavour, &c.<br>Then follows fondness, then envy, then avarice and then extinction of all<br>spiritual light. And when men are thus influenced by avarice, and<br>overcome by envy and fondness, their intellect ceases to be guided by<br>righteousness and they practise the very mockery of virtue. Practising<br>virtue with hypocrisy, they are content to acquire wealth by<br>dishonourable means with the wealth thus acquired the intelligent<br>principle in them becomes enamoured of those evil ways, and they are<br>filled with a desire to commit sins. And when, O good Brahmana, their<br>friends and men of wisdom remonstrate with them, they are ready with<br>specious answers, which are neither sound nor convincing. From their<br>being addicted to evil ways, they are guilty of a threefold sin. They<br>commit sin in thought, in word, as also in action. They being addicted to<br>wicked ways, all their good qualities die out, and these men of wicked<br>deeds cultivate the friendship of men of similar character, and<br>consequently they suffer misery in this world as well as in the next. The<br>sinful man is of this nature, and now hear of the man of virtue. He<br>discerns these evils by means of his spiritual insight, and is able to<br>discriminate between happiness and misery, and is full of respectful<br>attention to men of virtue, and from practising virtues, his mind becomes<br>inclined to righteousness.' The Brahmana replied, 'Thou hast given a true<br>exposition of religion which none else is able to expound. Thy spiritual<br>power is great, and thou dost appear to me to be like a great Rishi.' The<br>fowler replied, 'The great Brahmanas are worshipped with the same honours<br>as our ancestors and they are always propitiated with offerings of food<br>before others. Wise men in this world do what is pleasing to them, with<br>all their heart. And I shall, O good Brahmana, describe to thee what is<br>pleasing to them, after having bowed down to Brahmanas as a class. Do<br>thou learn from me the Brahmanic philosophy. This whole universe<br>unconquerable everywhere and abounding in great elements, is Brahma, and<br>there is nothing higher than this. The earth, air, water, fire and sky<br>are the great elements. And form, odour, sound, touch and taste are their<br>characteristic properties. These latter too have their properties which<br>are also correlated to each other. And of the three qualities, which are<br>gradually characterised by each, in order of priority is consciousness<br>which is called the mind. The seventh is intelligence and after that<br>comes egoism; and then the five senses, then the soul, then the moral<br>qualities called sattwa, rajas and tamas. These seventeen are said to be<br>the unknown or incomprehensible qualities. I have described all this to<br>thee, what else dost thou wish to know?'"
