                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing that Vidura had returned, and that the king<br>had consoled him, the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra began to burn in<br>grief. His understanding clouded by ignorance, he summoned the son of<br>Suvala, and Karna and Dussasana, and addressed them saying, 'The learned<br>Vidura, the minister of the wise Dhritarashtra, hath returned! The friend<br>of the sons of Pandu, he is ever engaged in doing what is beneficial to<br>them. So long as this Vidura doth not succeed in inducing the king to<br>bring them back, do ye all think of what may benefit me! If ever I behold<br>the sons of Pritha return to the city, I shall again be emaciated by<br>renouncing food and drink, even though there be no obstacle in my path!<br>And I shall either take poison or hang myself, either enter the pyre or<br>kill myself with my own weapons. But I shall never be able to behold the<br>sons of Pandu in prosperity!<br><br>"Sakuni said, 'O king, O lord of the earth, what folly hath taken<br>possession of thee! The Pandavas have gone to the forest, having given a<br>particular pledge, so that what thou apprehendest can never take place! O<br>bull of the Bharata race, the Pandavas ever abide by the truth. They will<br>never, therefore, accept the words of thy father! If however, accepting<br>the commands of the king, they come back to the capital, violating their<br>vow, even this would be our conduct, viz., assuming, an aspect of<br>neutrality, and in apparent obedience to the will of the monarch, we will<br>closely watch the Pandavas, keeping our counsels!'<br><br>"Dussasana said, 'O uncle of great intelligence, it is even as thou<br>sayest! The words of wisdom thou utterest always recommend themselves to<br>me!'"Karna said, 'O Duryodhana, all of us seek to accomplish thy will<br>and, O king, I see that unanimity at present prevaileth among us! The<br>sons of Pandu, with passions under complete control, will never return<br>without passing away the promised period. If, however, they do return<br>from failing sense, do thou defeat them again at dice.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Thus addressed by Karna, king Duryodhana with<br>cheerless heart, averted his face from his counsellors. Marking all this,<br>Karna expanding his beautiful eyes, and vehemently gesticulating in<br>anger, haughtily addressed Duryodhana and Dussasana and Suvala's son<br>saying, 'Ye princes, know ye my opinion! We are all servants of the king<br>(Duryodhana) waiting upon him with joined palms! We should, therefore, do<br>what is agreeable to him! But we are not always able to seek his welfare<br>with promptness and activity (owing to our dependence on Dhritarashtra)!<br>But let us now, encased in mail and armed with our weapons, mount our<br>cars and go in a body to slay the Pandavas now living in the forest!<br>After the Pandavas have been quieted and after they have gone on the<br>unknown journey, both ourselves and the sons of Dhritarashtra will find<br>peace! As long as they are in distress, as long as they are in sorrow, as<br>long as they are destitute of help, so long are we a match for them! This<br>is my mind!'<br><br>'Hearing those words of the charioteer's son, they repeatedly applauded<br>him, and at last exclaimed, 'Very well!' And saying this each of them<br>mounted his car, and sanguine of success, they rushed in a body to slay<br>the sons of Pandu. And knowing by his spiritual vision that they had gone<br>out, the master Krishna-Dwaipayana of pure soul came upon them, and<br>commanded them to desist. And sending them away, the holy one, worshipped<br>by all the worlds, quickly appeared before the king whose intelligence<br>served the purposes of eye-sight, and who was then seated (at his ease).<br>And the holy one addressed the monarch thus.'"
