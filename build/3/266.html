                            Vaisampayana said, "The daughter of Drupada, though naturally handsome,<br>was suffused with crimson arising from a fit of anger. And with eyes<br>inflamed and eye-brows bent in wrath, she reproved the ruler of the<br>Suviras, saying, 'Art thou not ashamed, O fool, to use such insulting<br>words in respect of those celebrated and terrible warriors, each like<br>unto Indra himself, and who are all devoted to their duties and who never<br>waver in fight with even hosts of Yakshas and Rakshasas? O Sauvira, good<br>men never speak ill of learned persons devoted to austerities and endued<br>with learning, no matter whether they live in the wilderness or in<br>houses. It is only wretches that are mean as thou who do so. Methinks<br>there is none in this assemblage of Kshatriya, who is capable of holding<br>thee by the hand to save thee from falling into the pit thou openest<br>under thy feet. In hoping to vanquish king Yudhishthira the just, thou<br>really hopest to separate, stick in hand, from a herd roaming in<br>Himalayan valleys, its leader, huge as a mountain peak and with the<br>temporal juice trickling down its rent temples. Out of childish folly<br>thou art kicking up into wakefulness the powerful lion lying asleep, in<br>order to pluck the hair from off his face! Thou shalt, however, have to<br>run away when thou seest Bhimasena in wrath! Thy courting a combat with<br>the furious Jishnu may be likened to thy kicking up a mighty, terrible,<br>full-grown and furious lion asleep in a mountain cave. The encounter thou<br>speakest of with those two excellent youths&#8212;the younger Pandavas&#8212;is<br>like unto the act of a fool that wantonly trampleth on the tails of two<br>venomous black cobras with bifurcated tongues. The bamboo, the reed, and<br>the plantain bear fruit only to perish and not to grow in size any<br>further. Like also the crab that conceiveth for her own destruction, thou<br>wilt lay hands upon me who am protected by these mighty heroes!'<br><br>Jayadratha replied, 'I know all this, O Krishna, and I am well aware of<br>the prowess of those princes. But thou canst not frighten us now with<br>these threats. We, too, O Krishna, belong by birth to the seventeen high<br>clans, and are endowed with the six royal qualities.[89] We, therefore,<br>look down upon the Pandavas as inferior men! Therefore, do thou, O<br>daughter of Drupada, ride this elephant or this chariot quickly, for thou<br>canst not baffle us with thy words alone; or, speaking less boastfully,<br>seek thou the mercy of the king of the Sauviras!'<br><br>Draupadi replied, "Though I am so powerful, why doth the king of Sauvira<br>yet consider me so powerless. Well-known as I am, I cannot, from fear of<br>violence, demean myself before that prince. Even Indra himself cannot<br>abduct her for whose protection Krishna and Arjuna would together follow,<br>riding in the same chariot. What shall I say, therefore, of a weak human<br>being. When Kiriti, that slayer of foes, riding on his car, will, on my<br>account, enter thy ranks, striking terror into every heart, he will<br>consume everything around like fire consuming a stack of dry grass in<br>summer. The warring princes of the Andhaka and the Vrishni races, with<br>Janardana at their head, and the mighty bowmen of the Kaikeya tribe, will<br>all follow in my wake with great ardour. The terrible arrows of<br>Dhananjaya, shot from the string of the Gandiva and propelled by his arms<br>fly with great force through the air, roaring like the very clouds. And<br>when thou wilt behold Arjuna shooting from the Gandiva a thick mass of<br>mighty arrows like unto a flight of locusts, then wilt thou repent of<br>thine own folly! Bethink thyself of what thou wilt feel when that warrior<br>armed with the Gandiva, blowing his conch-shell and with gloves<br>reverberating with the strokes of his bowstring will again and again<br>pierce thy breast with his shafts. And when Bhima will advance towards<br>thee, mace in hand and the two sons of Madri range in all directions,<br>vomiting forth the venom of their wrath, thou wilt then experience pangs<br>of keen regret that will last for ever. As I have never been false to my<br>worthy lords even in thought, so by that merit shall I now have the<br>pleasure of beholding thee vanquished and dragged by the sons of Pritha.<br>Thou canst not, cruel as thou art, frighten me by seizing me with<br>violence, for as soon as those Kuru warriors will espy me they will bring<br>me back to the woods of Kamyaka.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Then that lady of large eyes, beholding them<br>ready to lay violent hands on her, rebuked them and said, 'Defile me not<br>by your touch!' And in a great alarm she then called upon her spiritual<br>adviser, Dhaumya. Jayadratha, however, seized her by her upper garment,<br>but she pushed him with great vigour. And pushed by the lady, that sinful<br>wretch fell upon the ground like a tree severed from its roots. Seized,<br>however, once more by him with great violence, she began to pant for<br>breath. And dragged by the wretch, Krishna at last ascended his chariot<br>having worshipped Dhaumya's feet. And Dhaumya then addressed Jayadratha<br>and said, 'Do thou, O Jayadratha, observe the ancient custom of the<br>Kshatriyas. Thou canst not carry her off without having vanquished those<br>great warriors. Without doubt, thou shalt reap the painful fruits of this<br>thy despicable act, when thou encounterest the heroic sons of Pandu with<br>Yudhishthira the just at their head!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Having said these words Dhaumya, entering into<br>the midst of Jayadratha's infantry, began to follow that renowned<br>princess who was thus being carried away by the ravisher."
