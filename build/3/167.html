                            "Arjuna said, 'O Bharata, by the grace of that god of gods the Supreme<br>Soul, Tryamvaka, I passed the night at that place. And having passed the<br>night, when I had finished the morning rituals, I saw that foremost of<br>the Brahmanas whom I had seen before. And unto him I told all as it had<br>happened, O Bharata, namely, that I had met the divine Mahadeva.<br>Thereupon, O king of kings, well-pleased, he said unto me, 'Since thou<br>hast beheld the great god, incapable of being beheld by any one else,<br>soon wilt thou mix with Vaivaswata and the other Lokapalas and the lord<br>of the celestials; and Indra too will grant thee weapons.' O king, having<br>said this unto me and having embraced me again and again, that Bhrahmana<br>resembling the Sun, went away whither he listed. And, O slayer of foes,<br>it came to pass that on the evening of that day refreshing the whole<br>world, there began to blow a pure breeze. And in my vicinity on the base<br>of the Himalaya mountain fresh, fragrant and fair flowers began to bloom.<br>And on all sides there were heard charming symphony and captivating hymns<br>relating to Indra. And before the lord of the celestial hosts of Apsaras<br>and Gandharvas chanted various songs. And ascending celestial cars, there<br>approached the Marutas and the followers of Mahendra and the dwellers of<br>heaven. And afterwards, Marutvan together with Sachi and all the<br>celestials appeared on the scene in cars yoked with horses elegantly<br>adorned. And at this very moment, O king, he that goeth about on the<br>shoulders of men manifested himself unto me in excellent grace. And I saw<br>Yama seated on the south and Varuna and the lord of the celestials at<br>their respective regions. And, O foremost of men, O mighty monarch, they<br>after having cheered me said, 'O Savyasachin, behold us&#8212;the<br>Lokapalas&#8212;seated. For the performance of the task of the gods thou hast<br>obtained the sight of Sankara. Do thou now receive weapons from us seated<br>around.' Thereupon, O lord, having bowed down unto those foremost of the<br>celestials with regard, I duly accepted those mighty weapons. And then<br>they recognised me as one of their own. Afterwards the gods repaired to<br>the quarter from whence they had come. And that lord of the celestials,<br>the divine Maghavan too having ascended his glorious chariot, said, 'O<br>Phalguna, thou shalt have to repair unto the celestial region. O<br>Dhananjaya, even before this thy arrival I knew that thou wouldst come<br>hither. Then I, have O best of the Bharatas, manifested myself unto thee.<br>As formerly thou hadst performed thy ablution in the various tirthas and<br>now hast performed severe austerities, so thou wilt be able to repair<br>unto the celestial regions, O Pandava. Thou wilt, however, again have to<br>practise extreme penance, for thou shouldst at any rate journey to<br>heaven. And at my command, Matali shall take thee to the celestial<br>regions. Thou hast already been recognised by the celestials and the<br>celestial sages of high soul.' Thereupon I said unto Sakra, 'O divine<br>one, be thou favourable unto me. With the view of learning arms do I<br>beseech thee that thou mayst 'be my preceptor.' At this Indra said, 'O<br>child, having learnt weapons thou wouldst perform terrible deeds and with<br>this object thou desirest to obtain the weapons. However, obtain thou the<br>arms, as thou desirest.' Then I said, 'O slayer of foes, I never would<br>discharge these celestial weapons at mortals except when all my other<br>arms should have been baffled. Do thou, O lord of the celestials, grant<br>me the celestial weapons (so that) I may hereafter, obtain the regions<br>attainable by warriors.' Indra said, 'O Dhananjaya it is to try thee that<br>I have said such words unto thee. Having been begotten of me this speech<br>of thine well becometh thee. Do thou, O Bharata, repairing unto my abode<br>learn all the weapons of Vayu, of Agni, of the Vasus, of Varuna, of the<br>Marutas, of the Siddhas, of Brahma, of the Gandharvas of the Uragas, of<br>the Rakshasas, of Vishnu and of the Nairitas; and also all the weapons<br>that are with me, O perpetuator of the Kuru race.' Having said this unto<br>me Sakra vanished at the very spot. Then, O king, I saw the wonderful and<br>sacred celestial car yoked with steeds arrive conducted by Matali. And<br>when the Lokapalas went away Matali said unto me. 'O thou of mighty<br>splendour, the lord of the celestials is desirous of seeing thee. And O<br>mighty-armed one, do thou acquire competence and then perform thy task.<br>Come and behold the regions, attainable by merit and come unto heaven<br>even in this frame. O Bharata, the thousand-eyed lord of the celestials<br>wisheth to see thee.' Thus addressed by Matali, I, taking leave of the<br>mountain Himalaya and having gone round it ascended that excellent car.<br>And then the exceedingly generous Matali, versed in equine lore, drove<br>the steeds, gifted with the speed of thought or the wind. And when the<br>chariot began to move that charioteer looking at my face as I was seated<br>steadily, wondered and said these words, 'Today this appeareth unto me<br>strange and unprecedented that being seated in this celestial car, thou<br>hast not been jerked ever so little. O foremost of Bharata race, I have<br>ever remarked that at the first pull by the steeds even the lord of the<br>celestials himself getteth jerked. But all the while that the car had<br>moved, thou hast been sitting unshaken. This appeareth unto me as<br>transcending even the power of Sakra.'<br><br>"Having said this, O Bharata, Matali soared in the sky and showed me the<br>abodes of the celestials and their palaces. Then the chariot yoked with<br>steeds coursed upwards. And the celestials and the sages began to worship<br>(that car), O prime of men. And I saw the regions, moving anywhere at<br>will, and the splendour also of the highly energetic Gandharvas, Apsaras,<br>and the celestial sages. And Sakra's charioteer, Matali, at once showed<br>me Nandana and other gardens and groves belonging to the celestials. Next<br>I beheld Indra's abode, Amaravati, adorned with jewels and trees yielding<br>any sort of fruit that is desired. There the Sun doth not shed heat; nor<br>doth heat or cold or fatigue there affect (one), O king. And, O great<br>monarch, the celestials feel neither sorrow nor poverty of spirit, nor<br>weakness, nor lassitude, O grinder of foes. And, O ruler of men, the<br>celestials and the others have neither anger nor covetousness. And, O<br>king, in the abodes of the celestials, the beings are ever contented. And<br>there the trees ever bear verdant foliage, and fruits, and flowers; and<br>the various lakes are embalmed with the fragrance of lotuses. And there<br>the breeze is cool, and delicious, and fragrant, and pure, and inspiring.<br>And the ground is variegated with all kinds of gems, and adorned with<br>blossoms. And there were seen innumerable beautiful beasts and in the air<br>innumerable rangers of the sky. Then I saw the Vasus, and the Rudras, and<br>the Sadhyas with the Marutas, and the Adityas, and the two Aswins and<br>worshipped them. And they conferred their benison on me, granting me<br>strength and prowess, and energy, and celebrity, and (skill in) arms, and<br>victory in battle. Then, entering that romantic city adored by the<br>Gandharvas and the celestials, with joined hands, I stood before the<br>thousand-eyed lord of the celestials. Thereupon, that best of bestowers<br>gladly offered unto me half of his seat; and Vasava also with regard<br>touched my person. And, O Bharata, with the view of acquiring arms and<br>learning weapons, I began to dwell in heaven, together with the gods and<br>the Gandharvas of generous souls. And Viswavana's son, Chitrasena became<br>my friend. And he, O king, imparted unto me the entire Gandharva<br>(science). And, O monarch, I happily lived in Sakra's abode, well cared<br>for having all my desires gratified, learning weapons, listening to the<br>notes of songs, and the clear sounds of musical instruments, and<br>beholding the foremost of Apsaras dance. And without neglecting to study<br>the arts, which I learnt properly, my attention was specially fixed on<br>the acquisition of arms. And that lord of a thousand eyes was pleased<br>with that purpose of mine. Living thus in heaven, O king, I passed this<br>period.<br><br>"And when I had acquired proficiency in weapons, and gained his<br>confidence that one having for his vehicle the horse (Uchchaisrava),<br>(Indra), patting me on the head with his hand, said these words, 'Now<br>even the celestials themselves cannot conquer thee,&#8212;what shall I say of<br>imperfect mortals residing on earth? Thou hast become invulnerable in<br>strength, irrepressible, and incomparable in fight.' Then with the hair<br>of his body standing on end, he again accosted me saying, 'O hero, in<br>fighting with weapons none is equal unto thee. And, O perpetuator of the<br>Kuru race, thou art even watchful, and dexterous, and truthful, and of<br>subdued senses, and the protector of the Brahmanas and adept in weapons,<br>and warlike. And, O Partha, together with (a knowledge of) the five<br>modes, using (them), thou hast obtained five and ten weapons and,<br>therefore, there existeth none, who is thy peer. And thou hast perfectly<br>learnt the discharge (of those weapons) and (their) withdrawal, and<br>(their) re-discharge and re-withdrawal, and the Prayaschitta connected<br>(with them), and also their revival, in case of their being baffled. Now,<br>O represser of foes, the time hath arrived for thy paying the preceptor's<br>fee. Do thou promise to pay the fee; then I shall unfold unto thee what<br>thou wilt have to perform.' Thereat, O king, I said unto the ruler of the<br>celestials, 'If it be in my power to do the work, do thou consider it as<br>already accomplished by me.' O king, when I had said these words, Indra<br>with a smile said unto me 'Nothing is there in the three worlds that is<br>not in thy power (to achieve) My enemies, those Danavas, named,<br>Nivata-Kavachas dwell in the womb of the ocean. And they number thirty<br>million and are notorious, and all of equal forms and strength and<br>splendour. Do thou slay them there, O Kunti's son; and that will be thy<br>preceptor's fee.'<br><br>"Saying this he gave unto me the highly resplendent celestial car,<br>conducted by Matali, furnished with hair resembling the down of peacocks.<br>And on my head he set this excellent diadem. And he gave me ornaments for<br>my body, like unto his own. And he granted unto me the impenetrable<br>mail&#8212;the best of its kind, and easy to the touch; and fastened unto the<br>Gandiva this durable string. Then I set out, ascending that splendid<br>chariot riding on which in days of yore, the lord of the celestials and<br>vanquished Vali&#8212;that son of Virochana. And, O ruler of men, startled by<br>the rattling of the car, all the celestials, approached (there), taking<br>me to be the king of the celestials. And seeing me, they asked, 'O<br>Phalguna, what art thou going to do?' And I told them as it had fallen<br>out,&#8212;and said, 'I shall even do this in battle. Ye that are highly<br>fortunate, know that I have set out desirous of slaying the<br>Nivata-Kavachas. O sinless ones, do ye bless me.' Thereupon, they began<br>to eulogise me even as they (eulogise) the god, Purandara. And they said,<br>'Riding on this car, Maghavan conquered in battle Samvara, and Namuchi,<br>and Vala, and Vritra, and Prahrada, and Naraka. And mounted on this car<br>also Maghavan, had conquered in battle many thousands and millions and<br>hundreds of millions of Daityas. And, O Kaunteya, thou also, riding on<br>this car, by thy prowess shalt conquer the Nivatha-Kavachas in conflict,<br>even as did the self-possessed Maghavan in days of yore. And here is the<br>best of shells; by this also thou shalt defeat the Danavas And by this it<br>is that the high souled Sakra conquered the words.' Saying this, the gods<br>offered (unto me) this shell, Devadatta, sprung in the deep; and I<br>accepted it for the sake of victory. And at this moment, the gods fell<br>extolling me. And in order to be engaged in action, I proceeded to the<br>dreadful abode of the Danavas, furnished with the shell, the mail, and<br>arrows, and taking my bow."
