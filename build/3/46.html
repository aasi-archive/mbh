                            Vaisampayana said, 'Having thus sent away the Gandharva successful in his<br>mission, Urvasi of luminous smiles, moved by the desire of possessing<br>Phalguna, took a bath. And having performed her ablutions, she decked<br>herself in charming ornaments and splendid garlands of celestial odour.<br>And inflamed by the god of love, and her heart pierced through and<br>through by the shafts shot by Manmatha keeping in view the beauty of<br>Arjuna, and her imagination wholly taken up by the thoughts of Arjuna,<br>she mentally sported with him on a wide and excellent bed laid over with<br>celestial sheets. And when the twilight had deepened and the moon was up,<br>that Apsara of high hips sent out for the mansions of Arjuna. And in that<br>mood and with her crisp, soft and long braids decked with bunches of<br>flowers, she looked extremely beautiful. With her beauty and grace, and<br>the charm of the motions of her eye-brows and of her soft accents, and<br>her own moon like face, she seemed to tread, challenging the moon<br>himself. And as she proceeded, her deep, finely tapering bosoms, decked<br>with a chain of gold and adorned with celestial unguents and smeared with<br>fragrant sandal paste, began to tremble. And in consequence of the weight<br>of her bosoms, she was forced to slightly stoop forward at every step,<br>bending her waist exceedingly beautiful with three folds. And her loins<br>of faultless shape, the elegant abode of the god of love, furnished with<br>fair and high and round hips and wide at their lower part as a hill, and<br>decked with chains of gold, and capable of shaking the saintship of<br>anchorites, being decked with thin attire, appeared highly graceful. And<br>her feet with fair suppressed ankles, and possessing flat soles and<br>straight toes of the colour of burnished copper and dorsum high and<br>curved like tortoise back and marked by the wearing of ornaments<br>furnished with rows of little bells, looked exceedingly handsome. And<br>exhilarated with a little liquor which she had taken, and excited by<br>desire, and moving in diverse attitudes and expressing a sensation of<br>delight, she looked more handsome than usual. And though heaven abounded<br>with many wonderful objects, yet when Urvasi proceeded in this manner,<br>the Siddhas and Charanas and Gandharvas regarded her to be the handsomest<br>object they had cast their eyes upon. And the upper half of her body clad<br>in an attire of fine texture and cloudy hues, she looked resplendent like<br>a digit of the moon in the firmament shrouded by fleecy clouds. And<br>endued with the speed of the winds or the mind, she of luminous smiles<br>soon reached the mansion of Phalguna, the son of Pandu. And, O best of<br>men, Urvasi of beautiful eyes, having arrived at the gate of Arjuna's<br>abode, sent word through the keeper in attendance. And (on receiving<br>permission), she soon entered that brilliant and charming palace. But, O<br>monarch, upon beholding her at night in his mansion, Arjuna, with a<br>fearstricken heart, stepped up to receive her with respect and as soon as<br>he saw her, the son of Pritha, from modesty, closed his eyes. And<br>saluting her, he offered the Apsara such worship as is offered unto a<br>superior. And Arjuna said, 'O thou foremost of the Apsaras, I reverence<br>thee by bending my head down. O lady, let me know thy commands. I wait<br>upon thee as thy servant.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of Phalguna, Urvasi became<br>deprived of her senses. And she soon represented unto Arjuna all that had<br>passed between her and the Gandharva, Chitrasena. And she said, 'O best<br>of men, I shall tell thee all that hath passed between me and Chitrasena,<br>and why I have come hither. On account of thy coming here, O Arjuna,<br>Mahendra had convened a large and charming assembly, in which celestial<br>festivities were held. Unto that assembly came, O best of men, the Rudras<br>and the Adityas and the Aswins and the Vasus. And there came also numbers<br>of great Rishis and royal sages and Siddhas and Charanas and Yakshas and<br>great Nagas. And, O thou of expansive eyes, the members of the assembly<br>resplendent as fire or the sun or the moon, having taken their seats<br>according to rank, honour, and prowess, O son of Sakra, the Gandharvas<br>began to strike the Vinas and sing charming songs of celestial melody.<br>And, O perpetuator of the Kuru race, the principal Apsaras also commenced<br>to dance. Then, O son of Pritha, thou hadst looked on me only with a<br>steadfast gaze. When that assembly of the celestials broke, commanded by<br>thy father, the gods went away to their respective places. And the<br>principal Apsaras also went away to their abodes, and others also, O<br>slayer of foes, commanded by thy father and obtaining his leave. It was<br>then that Chitrasena sent to me by Sakra, and arriving at my abode. O<br>thou of eyes like lotus leaves, he addressed me, saying, 'O thou of the<br>fairest complexion, I have been sent unto thee by the chief of the<br>celestials. Do thou something that would be agreeable to Mahendra and<br>myself and to thyself also. O thou of fair hips, seek thou to please<br>Arjuna, who is brave in battle even like Sakra himself, and who is always<br>possessed of magnanimity.' Even these, O son of Pritha, were his words.<br>Thus, O sinless one, commanded by him and thy father also, I come to thee<br>in order to wait upon thee, O slayer of foes. My heart hath been<br>attracted by thy virtues, and am already under the influence of the god<br>of love. And, O hero, even this is my wish, and I have cherished it for<br>ever!"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "While in heaven, hearing her speak in this<br>strain, Arjuna was overcome with bashfulness. And shutting his ears with<br>his hands, he said, 'O blessed lady, fie on my sense of hearing, when<br>thou speakest thus to me. For, O thou of beautiful face, thou art<br>certainly equal in my estimation unto the wife of a superior. Even as<br>Kunti here even this is my wish, and I have cherished it for ever!"<br><br>[Some text is obviously missing here&#8212;JBH] of high fortune or Sachi the<br>queen of Indra, art thou to me, O auspicious one, of this there is no<br>doubt! That I had gazed particularly at thee, O blessed one, is true.<br>There was a reason for it. I shall truly tell it to thee, O thou of<br>luminous smiles! In the assembly I gazed at thee with eyes expanded in<br>delight, thinking, 'Even this blooming lady is the mother of the Kaurava<br>race.' O blessed Apsara, it behoveth thee not to entertain other feelings<br>towards me, for thou art superior to my superiors, being the parent of my<br>race.'"<br><br>"Hearing these words of Arjuna, Urvasi answered, saying, 'O son of The<br>chief of the celestials, we Apsaras are free and unconfined in our<br>choice. It behoveth thee not, therefore, to esteem me as thy superior.<br>The sons and grandsons of Puru's race, that have come hither in<br>consequence of ascetic merit do all sport with us, without incurring any<br>sin. Relent, therefore, O hero, it behoveth thee not to send me away. I<br>am burning with desire. I am devoted to thee. Accept me, O thou giver of<br>proper respect.'"<br><br>"Arjuna replied, 'O beautiful lady of features perfectly faultless,<br>listen. I truly tell thee. Let the four directions and the transverse<br>directions, let also the gods listen. O sinless one, as Kunti, or Madri,<br>or Sachi, is to me, so art thou, the parent of my race, an object of<br>reverence to me. Return, O thou of the fairest complexion: I bend my head<br>unto thee, and prostrate myself at thy feet. Thou deservest my worship as<br>my own mother; and it behoveth thee to protect me as a son.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus addressed by Partha, Urvasi was deprived of<br>her senses by wrath. Trembling with rage, and contracting her brows, she<br>cursed Arjuna, saying, 'Since thou disregardest a woman come to thy<br>mansion at the command of thy father and of her own motion&#8212;a woman,<br>besides, who is pierced by the shafts of Kama, therefore, O Partha, thou<br>shalt have to pass thy time among females unregarded, and as a dancer,<br>and destitute of manhood and scorned as a eunuch.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Having cursed Arjuna thus, Urvasi's lips still<br>quivered in anger, herself breathing heavily all the while. And she soon<br>returned to her own abode. And that slayer of foes, Arjuna also sought<br>Chitrasena without loss of time. And having found him, he told him all<br>that had passed between him and Urvasi in the night. And he told<br>Chitrasena everything as it had happened, repeatedly referring to the<br>curse pronounced upon him. And Chitrasena also represented everything<br>unto Sakra. And Harivahana, calling his son unto himself in private, and<br>consoling him in sweet words, smilingly said, 'O thou best of beings,<br>having obtained thee, O child, Pritha hath to-day become a truly blessed<br>mother. O mighty-armed one, thou hast now vanquished even Rishis by the<br>patience and self-control. But, O giver of proper respect, the curse that<br>Urvasi hath denounced on thee will be to thy benefit,<br><br>O child, and stand thee in good stead. O sinless one, ye will have on<br>earth to pass the thirteenth year (of your exile), unknown to all. It is<br>then that thou shalt suffer the curse of Urvasi. And having passed one<br>year as a dancer without manhood, thou shalt regain thy power on the<br>expiration of the term.'"<br><br>"Thus addressed by Sakra, that slayer of hostile heroes, Phalguna,<br>experienced great delight and ceased to think of the curse. And<br>Dhananjaya, the son of Pandu, sported in regions of heaven with the<br>Gandharva Chitrasena of great celebrity."<br><br>"The desires of the man that listeneth to this history of the son of<br>Pandu never run after lustful ends. The foremost of men, by listening to<br>this account of the awfully pure conduct of Phalguna, the son of the lord<br>of the celestials, become void of pride and arrogance and wrath and other<br>faults, and ascending to heaven, sport there in bliss."
