                            "Lomasa said, 'Now the news came to Saryati that Chyavana had been turned<br>into a youth. And well pleased he came, accompanied by his troops, to the<br>hermitage of the son of Bhrigu. And he saw Chyavana and Sukanya, like two<br>children sprung from celestials, and his joy and that of his wife were as<br>great as if the king had conquered the entire world. And the ruler of<br>earth together with his wife was received honourably by that saint. And<br>the king seated himself near the ascetic, and entered into a delightful<br>conversation of an auspicious kind. Then, O king, the son of Bhrigu spake<br>to the king these words of a soothing nature: 'I shall, O king, officiate<br>at a religious ceremony to be performed by thee: let the requisite<br>articles, therefore, be procured.' Thereat, that protector of earth<br>Saryati, experienced the very height of joy, and O great king, he<br>expressed his approbation of the proposal made by Chyavana. And on an<br>auspicious day, suitable for the commencement of a sacrificial ceremony,<br>Saryati ordered the erection of a sacrificial shrine of an excellent<br>description and splendidly furnished with all desirable things. There<br>Chyavana, the son of Bhrigu, officiated for the king as his priest. Now<br>listen to me relating the wonderful events which happened at that spot.<br>Chyavana took up a quantity of the Soma juice, in order that he might<br>offer the same to the Aswins, who were physicians to the celestials. And<br>while the saint was taking up the intended offering for those celestial<br>twins, Indra pronounced his interdiction, saying, These Aswins both of<br>them in my opinion have no right to receive an offering of the Soma<br>juice.' They are the physicians of the celestials in heaven,&#8212;this<br>vocation of theirs hath disentitled them (in the matter of Soma).<br>Thereupon Chyavana said, 'These two are of mighty enterprise, possessed<br>of mighty souls, and uncommonly endued with beauty and grace. And they, O<br>Indra, have converted me into an eternally youthful person, even like<br>unto a celestial. Why shouldst thou and the other celestials have a right<br>to the distilled Soma juice, and not they? O lord of the celestials, O<br>demolisher of hostile towns! be it known to thee that the Aswins also<br>rank as gods.' At this, Indra spake saying, These two practise the<br>healing art,&#8212;so they are but servants. And assuming forms at their<br>pleasure they roam about in the world of mortal beings. How can they then<br>rightfully claim the juice of the Soma?<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'When these very identical words were spoken again and<br>again by the lord of celestials, the son of Bhrigu, setting Indra at<br>naught, took up the offering he had intended to make. And as he was about<br>to take up an excellent portion of the Soma juice with the object of<br>offering it to the two Aswins, the destroyer of the demon Vala (Indra)<br>observed his act, and thus spoke unto him, 'If thou take up the Soma with<br>a view to offering it to those celestials, I shall hurl at thee my<br>thunderbolt of awful form, which is superior to all the weapons that<br>exist.' Thus addressed by Indra, the son of Bhrigu, cast at Indra a<br>smiling glance, and took up in due form a goodly quantity of the Soma<br>juice, to make an offering to the Aswins. Then Sachi's lord hurled at him<br>the thunderbolt of awful form. And as he was about to launch it, his arm<br>was paralysed by Bhrigu's son. And having paralysed his arm, Chyavana<br>recited sacred hymns, and made offering on the fire. His object gained,<br>he now attempted to destroy that celestial. Then by the virtue of that<br>saint's ascetic energy, an evil spirit came into being,&#8212;a huge demon,<br>Mada by name, of great strength and gigantic proportions. And his body<br>was incapable of being measured either by demons or by gods. And his<br>mouth was terrible and of huge size, and with teeth of sharpened edge.<br>And one of his jaws rested on the earth, and the other stretched to<br>heaven. And he had four fangs, each extending as far as one hundred<br>yojanas, and his other fangs were extended to the distance of ten<br>yojanas, and were of a form resembling towers on a palace, and which<br>might be likened to the ends of spears. And his two arms were like unto<br>hills, and extended ten thousand yojanas, and both were of equal bulk.<br>And his two eyes resembled the sun and the moon; and his face rivalled<br>the conflagration at the universal dissolution. And he was licking his<br>mouth with his tongue, which, like lightning, knew no rest. And his mouth<br>was open, and his glance was frightful, and seemed as if he would<br>forcibly swallow up the world. The demon rushed at the celestial by whom<br>a hundred sacrifices had been performed. And his intent was to devour<br>that deity. And the world resounded with the loud and frightful sounds<br>uttered by the Asura."
