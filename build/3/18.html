                            "Vasudeva continued, 'O king, afflicted with the arrows of Salwa, when<br>Pradyumna became senseless the Vrishnis who had come to the fight were<br>all disheartened and filled with grief! And the combatants of the Vrishni<br>and Andhaka races burst into exclamations of Oh! and Alas! while great<br>joy was felt by the enemy and beholding him thus deprived of sense, his<br>trained charioteer, the son of Daruka, soon carried him off the field by<br>the help of his steeds. The car had not gone far when that best of<br>warriors regained his senses, and taking up his bow addressed his<br>charioteer, saying, 'O son of the Suta tribe, what hast thou done? Why<br>dost thou go leaving the field of battle? This is not the custom of the<br>Vrishni heroes in battle! O son of a Suta, hast thou been bewildered at<br>the sight of a Salwa in that fierce encounter? Or hast thou been<br>disheartened, beholding the fight? O! tell me truly thy mind!' The<br>charioteer answered. 'O son of Janardana, I have not been confounded, nor<br>hath fear taken possession of me. On the other hand, O son of Kesava, the<br>task, I ween, of vanquishing Salwa is difficult for thee! Therefore, O<br>hero, I am slowly retiring from the field. This wretch is stronger than<br>thou art! It behoveth a charioteer to protect the warrior on the car,<br>however, when he is deprived of his senses! O thou gifted with length of<br>days, thou shouldst always be protected by me, even as it behoveth thee<br>to protect me! Thinking that the warrior on the car should always be<br>protected (by his charioteer), I am carrying thee away! Further, O thou<br>of mighty arms, thou art alone, while the Danavas are many. Thinking, O<br>son of Rukmini, that thou art not equal to them in the encounter, I am<br>going away!'<br><br>"Vasudeva continued, 'When the charioteer had spoken thus, he, O<br>Kauravya, who hath the makara for his mark replied unto him, saying,<br>'Turn the car! O son of Daruka, never do so again; never, O Suta, turn<br>thou from the fight, while I am alive! He is no son of the Vrishni race<br>who forsaketh the field or slayeth the foe fallen at his feet and crying<br>I am thine! or killeth a woman, a boy, or an old man, or a warrior in<br>distress, deprived of his car or with his weapons broken! Thou art born<br>in the race of charioteers and trained to thy craft! And, O son of<br>Daruka, thou art acquainted with the customs of the Vrishnis in battle!<br>Versed as thou art with all the customs of the Vrishnis in battle, do<br>thou, O Suta, never again fly from the field as thou hast done! What will<br>the irrepressible Madhava, the elder brother of Gada, say to me when he<br>heareth that I have left the field of battle in bewilderment or that I<br>have been struck on the back&#8212;a run-away from the combat! What will the<br>elder brother of Kesava, the mighty-armed Baladeva, clad in blue and<br>inebriate with wine, say, when he returneth? What also, O Suta, will that<br>lion among men, the grand-son of Sini (Satyaki), that great warrior, say<br>on hearing that I have forsaken the fight? And, O charioteer, what will<br>the ever-victorious Shamva, the irrepressible Charudeshna. and Gada, and<br>Sarana, and Akrura also of mighty arms, say unto me! What also will the<br>wives of the Vrishni heroes when they meet together, say of me who had<br>hitherto been considered as brave and well-conducted, respectable and<br>possessed of manly pride? They will even say This Pradyumna is a coward<br>who cometh here, leaving the battle! Fie on him! They will never say,<br>Well done! Ridicule, with exclamation of Fie, is to me or a person like<br>me O Suta, more than death! Therefore, do thou never again leave the<br>field of battle! Reposing the charge on me, Hari the slayer of Madhu,<br>hath gone to the sacrifice of the Bharata lion (Yudhishthira)! Therefore,<br>I cannot bear to be quiet now! O Suta, when the brave Kritavarman was<br>sallying out to encounter Salwa, I prevented him, saying I will resist<br>Salwa. Do thou stay! For honouring me the son of Hridika desisted! Having<br>left the field of battle, what shall I say unto that mighty warrior when<br>I meet him? When that irrepressible one of mighty arms&#8212;the holder of the<br>conch, the discus, and the mace&#8212;returneth, what shall I say unto him of<br>eyes like lotus leaves? Satyaki, and Valadeva, and others of the Vrishni<br>and Andhaka races always boast of me! What shall I say unto them? O Suta,<br>having left the field of battle and with wounds of arrows on my back<br>while being carried away by thee, I shall, by no means, be able to live!<br>Therefore, O son of Daruka, turn that car speedily, and never do so again<br>even in times of greatest danger! I do not, O Suta, think life worth<br>much, having fled from the field like a coward, and my back pierced, with<br>the arrows (of the enemy)! Hast thou ever seen me. O son of Suta, fly in<br>fear from the field of battle like coward? O son of Daruka, it behoved<br>thee not to forsake the battle, while my desire of fight was not yet<br>gratified! Do thou, therefore, go back to the field.'"
