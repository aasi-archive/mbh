                            "Draupadi continued, 'On this subject, the ancient story of the<br>conversation between Prahlada and Vali, the son of Virochana, is quoted<br>as an example. One day Vali asked his grand-father Prahlada, the chief of<br>the Asuras and the Danavas, possessed of great wisdom and well-versed in<br>the mysteries of the science of duty, saying, 'O sire, is forgiveness<br>meritorious or might and energy such? I am puzzled as regards this; O<br>sire, enlighten me who ask thee this! O thou conversant with all duties,<br>tell me truly which of these is meritorious? I will strictly obey<br>whatever thy command may be! Thus asked (by Vali), his wise grandfather,<br>conversant with every conclusion, replied upon the whole subject unto his<br>grand-son who had sought at his hands the resolution of his doubts. And<br>Prahlada said, 'Know, O child, these two truths with certainty, viz.,<br>that might is not always meritorious and forgiveness also is not always<br>meritorious! He that forgiveth always suffereth many evils. Servants and<br>strangers and enemies always disregard him. No creature ever bendeth down<br>unto him. Therefore it is, O child, that the learned applaud not a<br>constant habit of forgiveness! The servants of an ever-forgiving person<br>always disregard him, and contract numerous faults. These mean-minded men<br>also seek to deprive him of his wealth. Vile souled servants also<br>appropriate to themselves his vehicles and clothes and ornaments and<br>apparel and beds and seats and food and drink and other articles of use.<br>They do not also at the command of their master, give unto others the<br>things they are directed to give Nor do they even worship their master<br>with that respect which is their master's due. Disregard in this world is<br>worse than death. O child, sons and servants and attendants and even<br>strangers speak harsh words unto the man who always forgiveth. Persons,<br>disregarding the man of an ever-forgiving temper, even desire his wife,<br>and his wife also, becometh ready to act as she willeth. And servants<br>also that are ever fond of pleasure, if they do not receive even slight<br>punishments from their master, contract all sorts of vices, and the<br>wicked ever injure such a master. These and many other demerits attach to<br>those that are ever-forgiving!<br><br>"Listen now, O son of Virochana, to the demerits of those that are never<br>forgiving! The man of wrath who, surrounded by darkness, always<br>inflicteth, by help of his own energy, various kinds of punishment on<br>persons whether they deserve them or not, is necessarily separated from<br>his friends in consequence of that energy of his. Such a man is hated by<br>both relatives and strangers. Such a man, because he insulteth others,<br>suffereth loss of wealth and reapeth disregard and sorrow and hatred and<br>confusion and enemies. The man of wrath, in consequence of his ire,<br>inflicteth punishments on men and obtaineth (in return) harsh words. He<br>is divested of his prosperity soon and even of life, not to say, of<br>friends and relatives. He that putteth forth his might both upon his<br>benefactor and his foe, is an object of alarm to the world, like a snake<br>that hath taken shelter in a house, to the inmates thereof. What<br>prosperity can he have who is an object of alarm to the world? People<br>always do him an injury when they find a hole. Therefore, should men<br>never exhibit might in excess nor forgiveness on all occasions. One<br>should put forth his might and show his forgiveness on proper occasions.<br>He that becometh forgiving at the proper time and harsh and mighty also<br>at the proper time, obtaineth happiness both in this world and the other.<br><br>"'I shall now indicate the occasions in detail of forgiveness, as laid<br>down by the learned, and which should ever be observed by all. Hearken<br>unto me as I speak! He that hath done thee a service, even if he is<br>guilty of a grave wrong unto thee, recollecting his former service,<br>shouldst thou forgive that offender. Those also that have become<br>offenders from ignorance and folly should be forgiven for learning and<br>wisdom are not always easily attainable by man. They that having offended<br>thee knowingly, plead ignorance should be punished, even if their<br>offences be trivial. Such crooked men should never be pardoned. The first<br>offence of every creature should be forgiven. The second offence,<br>however, should be punished, even if it be trivial. If, however, a person<br>commiteth an offence unwillingly, it hath been said that examining his<br>plea well by a judicious enquiry, he should be pardoned. Humility may<br>vanquish might, humility may vanquish weakness. There is nothing that<br>humility may not accomplish. Therefore, humility is truly fiercer (than<br>it seemeth)! One should act with reference to place and time, taking note<br>of his own might or weakness. Nothing can succeed that hath been<br>undertaken without reference to place and time. Therefore, do thou ever<br>wait for place and time! Sometimes offenders should be forgiven from fear<br>of the people. These have been declared to be times of forgiveness. And<br>it hath been said that on occasions besides these, might should be put<br>forth against transgressors.'<br><br>"Draupadi continued, 'I, therefore, regard, O king, that the time hath<br>come for thee to put forth thy might! Unto those Kurus the covetous sons<br>of Dhritarashtra who injure us always, the present is not the time for<br>forgiveness! It behoveth thee to put forth thy might. The humble and<br>forgiving person is disregarded; while those that are fierce persecute<br>others. He, indeed, is a king who hath recourse to both, each according<br>to its time!'"
