                            Vaisampayana said, "Then contracting that huge body of his, which he had<br>assumed at will, the monkey with his arms again embraced Bhimasena. And O<br>Bharata, on Bhima being embraced by his brother, his fatigue went off,<br>and all (the powers of body) as also his strength were restored. And<br>having gained great accession of strength, he thought that there was none<br>equal to him in physical power. And with tears in his eyes, the monkey<br>from affection again addressed Bhima in choked utterance, saying, 'O<br>hero, repair to thy own abode. May I be incidentally remembered by thee<br>in thy talk! O best of Kurus, do not tell any one that I abide here. O<br>thou of great strength, the most excellent of the wives of the gods and<br>Gandharvas resort to this place, and the time of their arrival is nigh.<br>My eyes have been blessed (by seeing thee). And, O Bhima, having felt a<br>human being by coming in contact with thee, I have been put in mind of<br>that son of Raghu, who was Vishnu himself under the name of Rama, and who<br>delighted the heart of the world; and who was as the sun in regard to the<br>lotus face of Sita, and also to that darkness&#8212;Ravana. Therefore, O<br>heroic son of Kunti, let not thy meeting with me be fruitless. Do thou<br>with fraternal feeling ask of me a boon, O Bharata. If this be thy wish,<br>that going to Varanavata, I may destroy the insignificant sons of<br>Dhritarashtra&#8212;even this will I immediately do. Or if this be thy wish<br>that, that city may be ground by me with rocks, or that I may bind<br>Duryodhana and bring him before thee, even this will I do to-day, O thou<br>of mighty strength.'<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Hearing those words of that high-souled one,<br>Bhimasena with a cheerful heart answered Hanuman, saying, 'O foremost of<br>monkeys, I take all this as already performed by thee. Good happen to<br>thee. O mighty-armed one! I ask of thee this,&#8212;be thou well pleased with<br>me. O powerful one, on thy having become our protector, the Pandavas have<br>found help. Even by thy prowess shall we conquer all foes." Thus<br>addressed, Hanuman said unto Bhimasena, 'From fraternal feeling and<br>affection, I will do good unto thee, by diving into the army of thy foes<br>copiously furnished with arrows and javelins. And, O highly powerful one,<br>O hero, when thou shall give leonine roars, then shall I with my own, add<br>force to shouts. Remaining on the flagstaff of Arjuna's car will I emit<br>fierce shouts that will damp the energy of thy foes. Thereby ye will slay<br>them easily.' Having said this unto Pandu's son, and also pointed him out<br>the way. Hanuman vanished at that spot."
