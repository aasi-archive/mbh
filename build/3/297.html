                            "Markandeya continued, 'When the night had passed away, and the solar orb<br>had risen, those ascetics, having performed their morning rites,<br>assembled together. And although those mighty sages again and again spake<br>unto Dyumatsena of the high fortune of Savitri, yet they were never<br>satisfied. And it so happened, O king, that there came to that hermitage<br>a large body of people from Salwa. And they brought tidings of the enemy<br>of Dyumatsena having been slain by his own minister. And they related<br>unto him all that had happened, viz., how having heard that the usurper<br>had been slain with all his friends and allies by his minister, his<br>troops had all fled, and how all the subjects had become unanimous (on<br>behalf of their legitimate king), saying, 'Whether possessed of sight or<br>not, even he shall be our king!' And they said, 'We have been sent to<br>thee in consequence of that resolve. This car of thine, and this army<br>also consisting of four kinds of forces, have arrived for thee! Good<br>betide thee, O King! Do thou come! Thou hast been proclaimed in the city.<br>Do thou for ever occupy the station belonging to thy lather and<br>grand-father!' And beholding the king possessed of sight and able-bodied,<br>they bowed down their heads, their eyes expanded with wonder. Then having<br>worshipped those old and Brahmanas dwelling in the hermitage and honoured<br>by them in return, the king set out for his city. And surrounded by the<br>soldiers, Saivya also accompanied by Savitri, went in a vehicle furnished<br>with shining sheets and borne on the shoulders of men. Then the priests<br>with joyful hearts installed Dyumatsena on the throne with his<br>high-souled son as prince-regent. And after the lapse of a long time,<br>Savitri gave birth to a century of sons, all warlike and unretreating<br>from battle, and enhancing the fame of Salwa's race. And she also had a<br>century of highly powerful uterine brothers born unto Aswapati, the lord<br>of the Madras, by Malavi. Thus, O son of Pritha, did Savitri raise from<br>pitiable plight to high fortune, herself, and her father and mother, her<br>father-in-law and mother-in-law, as also the race of her husband. And<br>like that gentle lady Savitri, the auspicious daughter of Drupada, endued<br>with excellent character, will rescue you all."<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Thus exhorted by that high-souled sage, the son of<br>Pandu, O king, with his mind free from anxiety, continued to live in the<br>forest of Kamyaka. The man that listeneth with reverence to the excellent<br>story of Savitri, attaineth to happiness, and success in everything, and<br>never meeteth with misery!"
