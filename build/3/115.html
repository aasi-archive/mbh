                            "Vaisampayana said, 'The protector of the earth spent there a single<br>night, and with his brothers, paid the highest honours to the religious<br>men. And Lomasa made him acquainted with the names of all of them, such<br>as the Bhrigus, the Angiras, the Vasishthas, and the Kasyapas. And the<br>royal saint paid visit to them all and made obeisance to them with joined<br>palms. And then he asked the valiant Akritavrana, who was a follower of<br>Parasurama, when will the revered Parasurama show himself to the<br>religious men here? It is desired on that occasion to obtain a sight of<br>the descendant of Bhrigu.'<br><br>"Akritavrana said, 'Thy journey to this spot is already known to Rama,<br>whose soul spontaneously knows everything. And he is in every way<br>well-pleased with thee, and he will show himself readily to thee. And the<br>saints who practise penances here, are permitted to see him on the<br>fourteenth and the eighth day of the lunar course. On the morrow at the<br>end of this very night there will set in the fourteenth day of the lunar<br>course. On that occasion thou wilt have a sight of him, clad in a sable<br>deerskin, and wearing his hair in the form of a matted mass."<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, Thou hast been a follower of the mighty Rama,<br>Jamadagni's son; thou must, therefore, have been the eye-witness of all<br>the deeds achieved by him in former days. I, therefore, request thee to<br>narrate to me how the members of the military caste were vanquished by<br>Rama on the field of battle, and what the original cause of those<br>conflicts was.'<br><br>"Akritavrana said, 'With pleasure shall I recite to thee that excellent<br>story, O Bharata's son, O chief of kings, the story of the godlike deeds<br>of Rama, the son of Jamadagni, who traced his origin to Bhrigu's race. I<br>shall also relate the achievements of the great ruler of the Haihaya<br>tribe. That king, Arjuna by name, the mighty lord of the Haihaya tribe<br>was killed by Rama. He, O Pandu's son, was endued with a thousand arms;<br>and by the favour of Dattatreya he likewise had a celestial car made of<br>gold. And, O protector of the earth, his rule extended over the entire<br>animated world, wheresoever located on this earth. And the car of that<br>mighty monarch could proceed everywhere in an unobstructed course. And<br>grown resistless by the virtue of a granted boon, he ever mounted on that<br>car, trampled upon gods and Yakshas and saints on all sides round. And<br>all the born beings wheresoever placed, were harassed by him. Then the<br>celestials and the saints of a rigidly virtuous life, met together, and<br>thus spake to Vishnu, the god of gods, the slayer of demons, and<br>possessed of prowess that never failed, saying. 'O blessed and revered<br>lord, for the purpose of preserving all the born beings, it is necessary<br>that Arjuna should be killed by thee.' And the mighty ruler of the<br>Haihaya tribe placing himself on his celestial car, affronted Indra,<br>while that deity was enjoying himself with Sachi, his queen. Then, O<br>Bharata's son, the blessed and the revered god (Vishhnu) held a<br>consultation with Indra, with a view to destroying Kartavirya's son. And<br>on that occasion, all that was for the good of the world of beings, was<br>communicated by the lord of gods; and the blessed god worshipped by the<br>world, to do all that was necessary, went to the delightful Vadari wood<br>which was his own chosen retreat for practising penances. And at this<br>very time there lived on the earth a mighty monarch in the land of<br>Kanyakuvja, a sovereign whose military force was exceedingly great. And<br>his name of Gadhi was famous in the world. He, however, betook himself to<br>a forest-life. And while he was dwelling in the midst of the wood, there<br>was born to him a daughter beautiful as a nymph of heaven. And Richika,<br>the son of Bhrigu, asked for her to be united with himself in marriage.<br>And then Gadhi spake to that Brahmana, who led a rigidly austere life,<br>saying. There is a certain family custom in our race; it hath been<br>founded by my ancestors of a bygone age. And, O most excellent of the<br>sacerdotal caste, be it known to thee that the intending bridegroom must<br>offer a dowry consisting of a thousand fleet steeds, whose colour must be<br>brown and every one of whom must possess a single sable car. But, O<br>Bhrigu's son, a reverend saint like thee cannot be asked to offer the<br>same. Nor can my daughter be refused to a magnanimous saint of thy<br>(exalted) rank.' Thereupon Richika said, 'I will give thee a thousand<br>fleet steeds, brown in hue and possessing a single sable car; let thy<br>daughter be given in marriage to me.'<br><br>"Akritavrana said. Thus having given his word, O king, he went and said<br>to Varuna, 'Give me a thousand fleet steeds brown in colour, and each<br>with one black ear. I want the same as dowry for my marriage.' To him<br>Varuna forthwith gave a thousand steeds. Those steeds had issued out of<br>the river Ganga; hence the spot hath been named: The horse's landing<br>place. And in the city of Kanyakuvja, the daughter of Gadhi, Satyavati by<br>name, was given in marriage; and the gods themselves were of the party of<br>the bride. Richika, the most excellent of the sacerdotal caste, thus<br>procured a thousand steeds, and had a sight of the dwellers of heaven and<br>won a wife in the proper form. And he enjoyed himself with the girl of<br>slender waist, and thus gratified all the wishes and desire that he ever<br>had. And when the marriage had been celebrated, O king, his father Bhrigu<br>came on a visit to see him and his wife; and he was glad to see his<br>praiseworthy son. And the husband and wife together paid their best<br>respects to him, who was worshipped by all the gods. And when he had<br>seated himself, they both with joined palms, stood near him, in order<br>that they might to his bidding. And then the revered saint, Bhrigu, glad<br>at heart, thus spoke to his daughter-in-law, saying, 'O lovely daughter,<br>as for a boon I am ready to grant thee any object of thy wish.' And there<br>upon she asked for his favour in this, that a son might be born to both<br>herself and her mother. And he vouchsafed the favour thus asked for.'<br><br>"Bhrigu said, 'During the days that your season lasts, thou and thy<br>mother must take a bath, with the ceremony for bringing forth a male<br>child. And ye two must then separately embrace two different trees&#8212;she a<br>peepal tree, and thou a fig tree. And, O dutiful girl, here are two pots<br>of rice and milk, prepared by me with the utmost care. I having ransacked<br>the whole universe to find the drugs, the essence whereof hath been<br>blended with this milk and rice. It must be taken as food with the<br>greatest care.' And saying this, he vanished from sight. The two ladies,<br>however, made an interchange both in the matter of the pots of rice, and<br>likewise as regards the trees (to be embraced by each). Then after the<br>lapse of very many days, the revered saint, once more came. And he came<br>knowing (what had happened) by his attribute of divine knowledge. Then<br>Bhrigu possessed of mighty strength, spake to Satyavati, his<br>daughter-in-law, saying, 'O dutiful girl! O my daughter of a lovely brow,<br>the wrong pot of rice thou tookest as food. And it was the wrong tree<br>which was embraced by thee. It was thy mother who deluded thee. A son<br>will be born of thee, who, though of the priestly caste, will be of a<br>character fit for the military order; while a mighty son will be born of<br>thy mother, who, though by birth a Kshatriya will assume a life suitable<br>to the sacerdotal order. And his power will be great, and he will walk on<br>the path trodden by righteous men.' Then she entreated her father-in-law<br>again and again, saying, 'Let not my son be of this character; but let my<br>grandson be such.' And, O Pandu's son, he replied, 'So let it be!' And<br>thus he was pleased to grant her prayer. Then she brought forth on the<br>expected day a son by name Jamadagni. And this son of Bhrigu was endowed<br>with both splendour and grace. And he grew in years and in strength, and<br>excelled he other saints in the proficiency of his Vaidik lore. O<br>chieftain of Bharata's race, to him, rivalling in lustre the author of<br>light (the sun), came spontaneously and without instruction the knowledge<br>of the entire military art and of the fourfold missile arms.'"
