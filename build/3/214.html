                            "Markandeya continued, 'The virtuous fowler, having introduced his (both)<br>parents to that Brahmana as his highest gurus, again spoke to him as<br>follows, 'Mark thou the power of this virtue of mine, by which my inner<br>spiritual vision is extended. For this, thou wast told by that<br>self-restrained, truthful lady, devoted to her husband, 'Hie thee to<br>Mithila; for there lives a fowler who will explain to thee, the mysteries<br>of religion.' The Brahmana said, 'O pious man, so constant in fulfilling<br>thy religious obligations, bethinking myself of what that truthful<br>good-natured lady so true to her husband, hath said, I am convinced that<br>thou art really endowed with every high quality.' The fowler replied, 'I<br>have no doubt, my lord, that what that lady, so faithful to her husband,<br>said to thee about me, was said with full knowledge of the facts. I have,<br>O Brahmana, explained to thee all this as a matter of favour. And now,<br>good sir, listen to me. I shall explain what is good for thee. O good<br>Brahmana, of irreproachable character, thou hast wronged thy father and<br>thy mother, for thou hast left home without their permission, for the<br>purpose of learning the Vedas. Thou hast not acted properly in this<br>matter, for thy ascetic and aged parents have become entirely blind from<br>grief at thy loss. Do thou return home to console them. May this virtue<br>never forsake thee Thou art high-minded, of ascetic merit, and always<br>devoted to thy religion but all these have become useless to thee. Do<br>thou without delay return to console thy parents. Do have some regard for<br>my words and not act otherwise; I tell thee what is good for thee, O<br>Brahmana Rishi, Do thou return home this very day.' The Brahmana replied,<br>'This that thou hast said, is undoubtedly true; mayst thou, O pious man,<br>attain prosperity; I am much pleased with thee.' The fowler said, 'O<br>Brahmana, as thou practisest with assiduousness those divine, ancient,<br>and eternal virtues which are so difficult of attainment even by<br>pure-minded persons, thou appearest (to me) like a divine being. Return<br>to the side of thy father and mother and be quick and diligent in<br>honouring thy parents; for, I do not know if there is any virtue higher<br>than this.' The Brahmana replied, 'By a piece of singular good luck have<br>I arrived here, and by a piece of similar good luck have I thus been<br>associated with thee. It is very difficult to find out, in our midst, a<br>person who can so well expound the mysteries of religion; there is<br>scarcely one man among thousands, who is well versed in the science of<br>religion. I am very glad, O great man, to have secured thy friendship;<br>mayst thou be prosperous. I was on the point of falling into hell, but<br>was extricated by thee. It was destined to be so, for thou didst<br>(unexpectedly) come in my way. And, O great man, as the fallen King<br>Yayati was saved by his virtuous grandsons (daughter's sons), so, have I<br>know been saved by thee. According to thy advice, I shall honour my<br>father and my mother; for a man with an impure heart can never expound<br>the mysteries of sin and righteousness. As it is very difficult for a<br>person born in the Sudra class to learn the mysteries of the eternal<br>religion, I do not consider thee to be a Sudra. There must surely be some<br>mystery in connection with this matter. Thou must have attained the<br>Sudra's estate by reason of the fruition of thine own past karma. O<br>magnanimous man, I long to know the truth about this matter. Do thou tell<br>it to me with attention and according to thy own inclination.'<br><br>"The fowler replied, 'O good Brahmana, Brahmanas are worthy of all<br>respect from me. Listen, O sinless one, to this story of a previous<br>existence of mine. O son of an excellent Brahmana, I was formerly a<br>Brahmana, well-read in the Vedas, and an accomplished student of the<br>Vedangas. Through my own fault I have been degraded to my present state.<br>A certain king, accomplished in the science of dhanurveda (science of<br>archery), was my friend; and from his companionship, O Brahmana, I, too<br>became skilled in archery; and one day the king, in company with his<br>ministers and followed by his best warriors, went out on a hunting<br>expedition. He killed a large number of deer near a hermitage. I, too, O<br>good Brahmana, discharged a terrible arrow. And a rishi was wounded by<br>that arrow with its head bent out. He fell down upon the ground, and<br>screaming loudly said, 'I have harmed no one, what sinful man has done<br>this?' And, my lord, taking him for a deer, I went up to him and found<br>that he was pierced through the body by my arrow. On account of my wicked<br>deed I was sorely grieved (in mind). And then I said to that rishi of<br>severe ascetic merit, who was loudly crying, lying upon the ground, 'I<br>have done this unwittingly, O rishi.' And also this I said to the muni:<br>'Do thou think it proper to pardon all this transgression.' But, O<br>Brahmana, the rishi, lashing himself into a fury, said to me, 'Thou shalt<br>be born as a cruel fowler in the Sudra class."
