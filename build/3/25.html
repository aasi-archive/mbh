                            Vaisampayana said, "Having fallen into distress, those princes thus<br>obtained at last a pleasant habitation in that forest. And there in those<br>woods abounding with Sala trees and washed by the Saraswati, they who<br>were like so many Indras, began to sport themselves. And the illustrious<br>king, that bull of the Kuru race, set himself to please all the Yatis and<br>Munis and the principal Brahmanas in that forest, by offerings of<br>excellent fruits and roots. And their priest, Dhaumya endued with great<br>energy, like unto a father to those princes, began to perform the<br>sacrificial rites of Ishti and Paitreya for the Pandavas residing in that<br>great forest. And there came, as a guest, unto the abode of the<br>accomplished Pandavas living in the wood after loss of their kingdom, the<br>old Rishi Markandeya, possessed of intense and abundant energy. And that<br>bull of the Kuru race, the high-souled Yudhishthira, possessed of<br>unrivalled strength and prowess, paid his homage unto that great Muni,<br>reverenced by celestials and Rishis of men, and possessed of the<br>splendour of blazing fire. And that illustrious and all-knowing Muni, of<br>unrivalled energy, beholding Draupadi and Yudhishthira and Bhima and<br>Arjuna, in the midst of the ascetics, smiled, recollecting Rama in his<br>mind. And Yudhishthira the just, apparently grieved at this, asked him,<br>saying, 'All these ascetics are sorry for seeing me here. Why is it that<br>thou alone smilest, as if an glee, in the presence of these?' Markandeya<br>replied, 'O child', I too am sorry and do not smile in glee! Nor doth<br>pride born of joy possess my heart! Beholding to-day the calamity, I<br>recollect Rama, the son of Dasaratha, devoted to truth! Even that Rama,<br>accompanied by Lakshman, dwelt in the woods at the command of his father.<br>O son of Pritha, I beheld him in days of old ranging with his bow on the<br>top of the Rishyamuka hills! The illustrious Rama was like unto Indra,<br>the lord of Yama himself, and the slayer of Namuchi! Yet that sinless one<br>had to dwell in the forest at the command of his father, accepting it as<br>his duty. The illustrious Rama was equal unto Sakra in prowess, and<br>invincible in battle. And yet he had to range the forest renouncing all<br>pleasures! Therefore should no one act unrighteously, saying,&#8212;I am<br>mighty! Kings Nabhaga and Bhagiratha and others, having subjugated by<br>truth this world bounded by the seas, (finally) obtained, O child, all<br>the region hereafter. Therefore, should no one act unrighteously,<br>saying,&#8212;I am mighty! And, O exalted of men, the virtuous and truthful<br>king of Kasi and Karusha was called a mad dog for having renounced his<br>territories and riches! Therefore, should no one act unrighteously,<br>saying,&#8212;I am mighty! O best of men, O son of Pritha, the seven righteous<br>Rishis, for having observed the ordinance prescribed by the Creator<br>himself in the Vedas, blaze in the firmament. Therefore, should no one<br>act unrighteously, saying,&#8212;I am mighty! Behold, O king, the mighty<br>elephants, huge as mountain cliffs and furnished with tusks, transgress<br>not, O exalted of men, the laws of the Creator! Therefore, should none<br>act unrighteously saying, Might is mine! And, O foremost of monarchs,<br>behold all the creatures acting according to their species, as ordained<br>by the Creator. Therefore, should none act unrighteously, saying, Might<br>is mine. O son of Pritha, in truth, and virtue, and proper behaviour, and<br>modesty, thou hast surpassed all creatures, and thy fame and energy are<br>as bright as fire or the Sun! Firm in thy promises, O illustrious one,<br>having passed in the woods thy painful exile, thou wilt again, O king,<br>snatch from the Kauravas thy blazing prosperity with the help of thy own<br>energy!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Having spoken these words unto Yudhishthira<br>(seated) in the midst of the ascetics with friends, the great Rishi<br>having also saluted Dhaumya and all the Pandavas set out in a northerly<br>direction!"
