                            Vaisampayana said, "Beholding king Duryodhana, incapable of putting up<br>with an insult, seated with the resolution of giving up life by forgoing<br>food, Sakuni, the son of Suvala, said these words to comfort him. Sakuni<br>said, O son of the Kuru race, you have just heard what Kama hath said.<br>His words are, indeed fraught with wisdom. Why wouldst thou abandoning<br>from foolishness the high prosperity that I won for thee, cast off thy<br>life today, O king, yielding to silliness? It seemeth to me to-day that<br>thou hast never waited upon the old. He that cannot control sudden<br>accession of joy or grief, is lost even though he may have obtained<br>prosperity, like an unburnt earthen vessel in water. That king who is<br>entirely destitute of courage, who hath no spark of manliness, who is the<br>slave of procrastination, who always acts with indiscretion, who is<br>addicted to sensual pleasures, is seldom respected by his subjects.<br>Benefited as thou has been, whence is this unreasonable grief of thine?<br>Do not undo this graceful act done by the sons of Pritha, by indulging in<br>such grief. When thou shouldst joy and reward the Pandavas, thou art<br>grieving, O king? Indeed, this behaviour of thine is inconsistent. Be<br>cheerful, do not cast away thy life; but remember with a pleased heart<br>the good they have done thee. Give back unto the sons of Pritha their<br>kingdom, and win thou both virtue and renown by such conduct. By acting<br>in this way, thou mayst be grateful. Establish brotherly relations with<br>the Pandavas by being friends, and give them their paternal kingdom, for<br>then thou wilt be happy!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Hearing these words of Sakuni, and seeing the<br>brave Dussasana lying prostrate before him unmanned by fraternal love,<br>the king raised Dussasana and, clasping him in his well round arms, smelt<br>his head from affection. And hearing these words of Karna and Sauvala,<br>king Duryodhana lost heart more than ever, and he was overwhelmed with<br>shame and utter despair overtook his soul. And hearing all that his<br>friends said, he answered with sorrow, 'I have nothing more to do with<br>virtue, wealth, friendship, affluence, sovereignty, and enjoyments. Do<br>not obstruct my purpose, but leave me all of you. I am firmly resolved to<br>cast away my life by forgoing food. Return to the city, and treat my<br>superiors there respectfully.'<br><br>"Thus addressed by him, they replied unto that royal grinder of foes,<br>saying, 'O monarch, the course that is thine, is also ours, O Bharata.<br>How can we enter the city without thee?'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Though addressed in all manner of ways by his<br>friends and counsellors and brothers and relatives, the king wavered not<br>from his purpose. And the son of Dhritarashtra in accordance with his<br>purpose spread Kusa grass on the earth, and purifying himself by touching<br>water, sat down upon that spot. And clad in rags and Kusa grass he set<br>himself to observe the highest vow. And stopping all speech, that tiger<br>among kings, moved by the desire of going to heaven, began to pray and<br>worship internally suspending all external intercourse.<br><br>"Meanwhile the fierce Daityas and the Danavas who had been defeated of<br>old by the celestials and had been dwelling in the nether regions having<br>ascertained Duryodhana's purpose and knowing that if the king died their<br>party would be weakened, commenced a sacrifice with fire for summoning<br>Duryodhana to their presence. And mantra knowing persons then commenced<br>with the help of formulae declared by Brihaspati and Usanas, those rites<br>that are indicated in the Atharva Veda and the Upanishads and which are<br>capable of being achieved by mantras and prayers. And Brahmins of rigid<br>vows, well-versed in the Vedas and the branches, began, with rapt soul,<br>to pour libations of clarified butter and milk into the fire, uttering<br>mantras. And after those rites were ended, a strange goddess, O king,<br>with mouth wide open, arose (from the sacrificial fire), saying, 'What am<br>I to do?' And the Daityas with well-pleased hearts, commanded her,<br>saying, 'Bring thou hither the royal son of Dhritarashtra, who is even<br>now observing the vow of starvation for getting rid of his life.' Thus<br>commanded, she went away saying, 'So be it.' And she went in the<br>twinkling of an eye to that spot where Suyodhana was. And taking up the<br>king back to the nether regions, and having brought him thus in a moment,<br>she apprised the Danavas of it. And the Danavas beholding the king<br>brought into their midst in the night, united together, and all of them<br>with well-pleased hearts and eyes expanded in delight addressed these<br>flattering words to Duryodhana."
