                            Vaisampayana continued, "O king, O lord of men, that slayer of hostile<br>heroes, the Suta's son, said these words to Duryodhana, 'O Kaurava<br>Duryodhana, do thou lay unto thy heart the words that I shall tell thee;<br>and, O represser of foes, after having heard my words, it behoveth thee<br>to act accordingly every way. Now, O best of monarchs, O hero, hath the<br>earth been rid of foes. Do thou rule her even like the mighty-minded<br>Sakra himself, having his foes destroyed."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Having been thus addressed by Karna, the king<br>again spake unto him, saying, 'O bull among men, nothing whatever is<br>unattainable to him who hath thee for refuge, and to whom thou art<br>attached and on whose welfare thou art entirely intent. Now, I have a<br>purpose, which do thou truly listen to. Having beheld that foremost of<br>sacrifices, the mighty Rajasuya, performed by the Pandavas, a desire hath<br>sprung up in me (to celebrate the same). Do thou, O Suta's son, fulfil<br>this desire of mine.' Thus addressed, Karna spake thus unto the king,<br>'Now that all the rulers of the earth have been brought under thy<br>subjection, do thou summon the principal Brahmanas, and, O best of Kurus,<br>duly procure the articles required for the sacrifice. And, O represser of<br>foes, let Ritwijas as prescribed, and versed in the Vedas, celebrate thy<br>rites according to the ordinance, O king. And, O bull of the Bharata<br>race, let thy great sacrifice also, abounding in meats and drinks, and<br>grand with parts, commence.'<br><br>"O king, having been thus addressed by Karna, Dhritarashtra's son<br>summoned the priest, and spake unto him these words, 'Do thou duly and in<br>proper order celebrate for me that best of sacrifices, the Rajasuya<br>furnished with excellent Dakshinas.' Thus accosted, that best of<br>Brahmanas spake unto the king, saying, 'O foremost of the Kauravas, while<br>Yudhishthira is living, that best of sacrifices cannot be performed in<br>thy family, O Prince of kings! Further, O monarch, thy father<br>Dhritarashtra, endued with long life, liveth. For this reason also, O<br>best of kings, this sacrifice cannot be undertaken by thee. There is, O<br>lord, another great sacrifice, resembling the Rajasuya. Do thou, O<br>foremost of kings, celebrate that sacrifice. Listen to these words of<br>mine. All these rulers of the earth, who have, O king, become tributary<br>to thee, will pay thee tribute in gold, both pure and impure. Of that<br>gold, do thou, O best of monarchs, now make the (sacrificial) plough, and<br>do thou, O Bharata, plough the sacrificial compound with it. At that<br>spot, let there commence, O foremost of kings, with due rites, and<br>without any disturbance the sacrifice, sanctified with mantras abounding<br>in edibles. The name of that sacrifice worthy of virtuous persons, is<br>Vaishnava. No person save the ancient Vishnu hath performed it before.<br>This mighty sacrifice vies with that best of sacrifices&#8212;the Rajasuya<br>itself. And, further, it liketh us&#8212;and it is also for thy welfare (to<br>celebrate it). And, moreover, it is capable of being celebrated without<br>any disturbance. (By undertaking this), thy desire will be fufilled.'<br><br>"Having been thus addressed by those Brahmanas, Dhritarashtra's son, the<br>king, spake these words to Karna, his brothers and the son of Suvala,<br>'Beyond doubt, the words of the Brahmanas are entirely liked by me. If<br>they are relished by you also, express it without delay.' Thus appealed,<br>they all said unto the king, 'So be it.' Then the king one by one<br>appointed persons to their respective tasks; and desired all the artisans<br>to construct the (sacrificial) plough. And, O best of kings, all that had<br>been commanded to be done, was gradually executed."
