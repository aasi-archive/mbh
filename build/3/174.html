                            Vaisampayana continued, "And when the night had passed, Yudhishthira the<br>just, arose and together with his brothers, performed the necessary<br>duties. He then spake unto Arjuna, that delight of his mother, saying, 'O<br>Kaunteya, do thou show (me) those weapons with which thou vanquished the<br>Danavas.' Thereat, O king, the exceedingly powerful Dhananjaya, the son<br>of Pandu, duly practising extreme purity, showed those weapons, O<br>Bharata, which had been given unto him by the celestials. Dhananjaya<br>seated on the earth, as his chariot, which had the mountain for its pole,<br>the base of the axle and the cluster of beautiful-looking bamboo trees<br>for its socket-pole, looked resplendent with that celestial armour of<br>great lustre, took his bow Gandiva and the conch-shell given to him by<br>the gods, commenced to exhibit those celestial weapons in order. And as<br>those celestial weapons had been set, the Earth being oppressed with the<br>feet (of Arjuna), began to tremble with (its) trees; and the rivers and<br>the mighty main became vexed; and the rocks were riven; and the air was<br>hushed. And the sun did not shine; and fire did not flame; and by no<br>means did the Vedas of the twice-born once shine. And, O Janamejaya, the<br>creatures peopling the interior of the earth, on being afflicted, rose<br>and surrounded the Pandava, trembling with joined hands and contorted<br>countenances. And being burnt by those weapons, they besought Dhananjaya<br>(for their lives). Then the Brahmarshis, and the Siddhas, and the<br>Maharshis and the mobile beings&#8212;all these appeared (on the scene). And<br>the foremost Devarshis, and the celestials and the Yakshas and the<br>Rakshasas and the Gandharvas and the feathered tribes and the (other)<br>sky-ranging beings&#8212;all these appeared (on the scene). And the Great-sire<br>and all the Lokapalas and the divine Mahadeva, came thither, together<br>with their followers. Then, O great king, bearing unearthly variegated<br>blossoms Vayu (the Wind-god) fell to strewing them around the Pandava.<br>And sent by the celestials, the Gandharvas chanted various ballads; and,<br>O monarch, hosts of the Apsaras danced (there). At such a moment, O king,<br>sent by the celestials, Narada arrived (there) and addressed Partha in<br>these sweet words, 'O Arjuna, Arjuna, do thou not discharge the celestial<br>weapons. These should never be discharged when there is no object (fit).<br>And when there is an object (present), they should also by no means be<br>hurled, unless one is sore pressed; for, O son of the Kurus, to discharge<br>the weapons (without occasion), is fraught with great evil. And, O<br>Dhananjaya, being duly kept as thou hast been instructed to these<br>powerful weapons will doubtless conduce to thy strength and happiness.<br>But if they are not properly kept, they, O Pandava, will become the<br>instrument for the destruction of the three worlds. So thou shouldst not<br>act in this way again. O Ajatasatru, thou too wilt behold even these<br>weapons, when Partha will use them for grinding (thy) enemies in battle.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Having prevented Partha the immortals with<br>others that had come there, went to each his place, O foremost of men.<br>And, O Kaurava, after they had all gone, the Pandavas began to dwell<br>pleasantly in the same forest, together with Krishna."
