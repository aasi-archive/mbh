                            Vaisampayana said, "The magnanimous monarch pursued his journey, and at<br>different spots on the shore of the sea visited the various bathing<br>places, all sacred and pleasant and frequented by men of the sacerdotal<br>caste. And O son of Parikshit! He in proper form took his bath in them<br>together with his younger brothers and then went to an excellent river,<br>the holiest of all. There also the magnanimous king, took his plunge, and<br>offered libations to his forefathers and the gods, and distributed riches<br>to the leaders of the twice-born class. Then he went to the Godavari, a<br>river that falls directly into the sea. There he was freed from his sins.<br>And he reached the sea in the Dravida land, and visited the holy spot<br>passing under Agastya's name, which was exceedingly sacred and<br>exceptionally pure. And the valiant king visited the feminine sacred<br>spots. Here he listened to the story of that well-known feat which was<br>achieved by Arjuna, chief of all wielders of the bow, and which was<br>beyond the power of human beings to perform. And here he was praised by<br>the highest members of the saintly class, and the son of Pandu<br>experienced the greatest delight. And, O protector of the earth! the<br>ruler of the world, accompanied by Krishna bathed in those holy spots,<br>and speaking of Arjuna's valour in laudatory terms delightfully spent his<br>time in the place. Then he gave away thousands of cows at those holy<br>spots on the coast of the sea; and with his brothers narrated well<br>pleased how Arjuna had made a gift of kine. And he, O king! visited one<br>by one those holy places on the coast of the sea and many other sacred<br>spots, and thus fulfilled his heart's desire, till he came to the holiest<br>of all known by the name of Suparaka. Then having crossed a certain tract<br>on the coast of the sea, he reached a forest celebrated on earth. There<br>the deities had practised asceticism in former days, and likewise<br>virtuous rulers of men had performed sacrificial rites. There he,<br>possessed of long and lusty arms, beheld the celebrated altar of<br>Richika's son, who was the foremost of all wielders of the bow. And the<br>altar was girt round by hosts of ascetics, and was fit to be worshipped<br>by persons of a virtuous life. Then the king beheld the holy and<br>delightful shrines of all the gods and of the Vasus, and of the hosts of<br>wind and of the two celestial physicians and of Yama, son of the sun and<br>of the lord of riches, and of Indra, and of Vishnu, and of the lord<br>Creator and of Siva, and of the moon, and of the author of day, and of<br>the lord of waters, and of the host of Sadhyas, and of Brahma, and of the<br>forefathers, and of Rudra together with all his followers, and of the<br>goddess of learning, and of the host of Siddhas, and of many immortal<br>holy gods besides. And in those shrines the king observed various fasts,<br>and gave away large quantities of gems. He plunged his body in all the<br>holy spots, and then came again to Surparaka. And he by the same<br>landing-place of the sea again proceeded with his uterine brothers and<br>came over to the holy spot Prabhasa, whereof fame hath been spread by<br>mighty Brahmanas throughout the world. There he, possessed of a pair of<br>large red eyes, washed himself with all his younger brothers, and offered<br>libations to the forefathers and the celestial hosts; and so did Krishna<br>and all those Brahmanas together with Lomasa. For twelve days he<br>subsisted upon air and water. And he performed ablutions for days and<br>nights and surrounded himself with fires kindled on all sides. Thus that<br>greatest of all virtuous men engaged himself in asceticism. While he was<br>acting thus, information reached both Valarama and Krishna that the king<br>was practising penances of a most austere form and these two leaders of<br>the entire Vrishni tribe accompanied with troops came to Yudhishthira of<br>Ajamidha's race. And when the Vrishnis beheld that the sons of Pandu lay<br>down on the ground, their bodies besmeared all over with dirt and when<br>they beheld the daughter of Drupada in a sad state, their grief was great<br>and they could not refrain from breaking out in loud lamentations. Then<br>the king, whose courage was such that misfortune never could cast him<br>down, cordially met Rama and Krishna and Samva, Krishna's son, and the<br>grand-son of Sini and other Vrishnis, and paid honour to them in a<br>suitable form. And they also in return paid honour to all the sons of<br>Pritha, and were similarly honoured by Pandu's sons. And they seated<br>themselves round about Yudhishthira, as round Indra, O king! are seated<br>the celestial hosts. And highly pleased, he recounted to them all the<br>machinations of his adversaries, and how also he had resided in the<br>forest, and how Arjuna had gone to Indra's abode in order to learn the<br>science of arms&#8212;all this he related with a gladdened heart. And they<br>were happy to learn all this news from him; but when they saw the<br>Pandavas so exceedingly lean, the majestic and magnanimous Vrishnis could<br>not forbear shedding tears, which spontaneously gushed from their eyes on<br>account of the agony they felt."
