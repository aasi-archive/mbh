                            (Arjunabhigamana Parva)<br><br>Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing that the Pandavas had been banished, the<br>Bhojas, the Vrishnis, and the Andhakas went to those heroes residing in<br>affliction in the great forest. And the consanguineous relatives of<br>Panchala, and Dhrishtaketu the king of Chedi, and those celebrated and<br>powerful brothers&#8212;the Kaikeyas, their hearts fired with wrath, went to<br>the forest to see the sons of Pritha. And reproaching the sons of<br>Dhritarashtra, they said, 'What should we do?' And those bulls of the<br>Kshatriya race, with Vasudeva at their head, sat themselves down round<br>Yudhishthira the just. And respectfully saluting that foremost of the<br>Kurus, Kesava mournfully said, 'The earth shall drink the blood of<br>Duryodhana and Karna, of Dussasana and the wicked Sakuni! Slaying these<br>in battle and defeating their followers along with their royal allies,<br>will we all install Yudhishthira the just on the throne! The wicked<br>deserve to be slain! Verily, this is eternal morality.'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, 'And when on account of the wrongs of Pritha's<br>sons, Janardana had thus got into a passion, and seemed bent upon<br>consuming all created things, Arjuna exerted himself to pacify him. And<br>beholding Kesava angry, Falguna began to recite the feats achieved in his<br>former lives by that soul of all things, himself immeasurable, the<br>eternal one, of infinite energy, the lord of Prajapati himself, the<br>supreme ruler of the worlds, Vishnu of profound wisdom!'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'In days of old, thou, O Krishna, hadst wandered on the<br>Gandhamadana mountains for ten thousand years as a Muni having his home<br>where evening fell! Living upon water alone, thou hadst, in days of old,<br>O Krishna, also dwelt for full eleven thousand years by the lake of<br>Pushkara! And, O slayer of Madhu, with arms upraised and standing on one<br>leg, thou hadst passed a hundred years on the high hills of Vadari,[16]<br>living all the while upon air! And leaving aside thy upper garment, with<br>body emaciated and looking like a bundle of veins, thou hadst lived on<br>the banks of the Saraswati, employed in thy sacrifice extending for<br>twelve years! And, O Krishna of mighty energy, in observance of thy vow<br>thou hadst stood on one leg for the length of a thousand years of the<br>celestials, on the plains of Prabhasa which it behoveth the virtuous to<br>visit! Vyasa hath told me that thou art the cause of the creation and its<br>course! And, O Kesava, the lord of Kshetra,[17] thou art the mover of all<br>minds, and the beginning and end of all things! All asceticism resteth in<br>thee, and thou too art the embodiment of all sacrifices, and the eternal<br>one! Slaying the Asura Naraka, offspring of the Earth-first begotten,<br>thou hadst obtained his ear-rings, and performed, O Krishna, the first<br>horse-sacrifice (offering up that Asura as the sacrificial horse)! And, O<br>bull of all the worlds, having performed that feat, thou hast become<br>victorious over all! Thou hadst slain all the Daityas and Danavas<br>mustered in battle, and giving the lord of Sachi (Indra) the sovereignty<br>of the universe, thou hast, O Kesava of mighty arms, taken thy birth<br>among men! O slayer of all foes, having floated on the primordial waters,<br>thou subsequently becamest Hari,[18] and Brahma and Surya and Dharma, and<br>Dhatri and Yama and Anala and Vasu, and Vaisravana, and Rudra, and Kala<br>and the firmament the earth, and the ten directions! Thyself increate,<br>thou art the lord of the mobile and the immobile universe, the Creator of<br>all, O thou foremost of all existences! And, O slayer of Madhu, O thou of<br>abundant energy, in the forest of Chitraratha thou didst, O Krishna,<br>gratify with thy sacrifice the chief of all the gods, the highest of the<br>high! O Janardana, at each sacrifice thou didst offer, according to<br>shares, gold by hundreds and thousands. And, O son of the Yadava race,<br>becoming the son of Aditi, O exalted one of the supreme attributes, thou<br>hast been known as the younger brother of Indra! And, O thou chastiser of<br>foes, even while a child thou didst, O Krishna, in consequence of thy<br>energy, fill by three steps only the heaven, the firmament, and the<br>earth! And, O thou soul of all covering the heaven and the firmament<br>(while thou wert thus transformed), thou didst dwell in the body of the<br>sun and afflict him with thy own splendour! And, O exalted one, in thy<br>incarnations on those thousand occasions, thou hadst slain, O Krishna,<br>sinful Asuras by hundreds! By destroying the Mauravas and the Pashas, and<br>slaying Nisunda and Naraka. Thou hast again rendered safe the road to<br>Pragjyotisha! Thou hast slain Ahvriti at Jaruthi, and Kratha and Sisupala<br>with his adherents, and Jarasandha and Saivya and Satadhanwan! And on thy<br>car roaring like unto clouds and effulgent like the sun, thou didst<br>obtain for thy queen the daughter of Bhoja, defeating Rukmi in battle!<br>Thou didst in fury slay Indradyumna and the Yavana called Kaseruman! And<br>slaying Salwa the lord of Saubha, thou didst destroy that city of Saubha<br>itself! These have all been slain in battle; listen to me as I speak of<br>others (also slain by thee)! At Iravati thou hast slain king Bhoja equal<br>unto Karttavirya in battle, and both Gopati and Talaketu also have been<br>slain by thee! And, O Janardana, thou hast also appropriate unto thyself<br>the sacred city of Dwarka, abounding in wealth and agreeable unto the<br>Rishi themselves, and thou wilt submerge it at the end within the ocean!<br>O slayer of Madhu, how can crookedness be in thee, devoid as thou art, O<br>thou of the Dasarha race, of anger and envy and untruth and cruelty? O<br>thou who knowest no deterioration, all the Rishis, coming unto thee<br>seated in thy glory on the sacrificial ground, seek protection of thee!<br>And, O slayer of Madhu, thou stayest at the end of the Yuga, contracting<br>all things and withdrawing this universe into thy own self, thou<br>repressor of all foes! O thou of the Vrishni race, at the beginning of<br>the Yuga, there sprang from thy lotus-like navel, Brahma himself, and<br>lord of all mobile and immobile things, and whose is this entire<br>universe! When the dreadful Danavas Madhu and Kaitava were bent on<br>slaying Brahma, beholding their impious endeavour thou wert angry, and<br>from thy forehead, O Hari, sprang Sambhu, the holder of the trident. Thus<br>these two foremost of the deities have sprung from thy body in order to<br>do thy work! Even Narada it was who hath told me this! O Narayana, thou<br>didst, in the forest of Chaitraratha, celebrate with plentiful gifts a<br>grand sacrifice consisting of a multitude of rites! O God, O thou of eyes<br>like lotus leaves, the deeds thou hast performed while still a boy,<br>having recourse to thy might and aided by Baladeva, have never been done<br>by others, nor are they capable of being achieved by others in the<br>future! Thou didst even dwell in Kailasa, accompanied by Brahmanas!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having addressed Krishna thus, the illustrious<br>Pandava, who was the soul of Krishna, became dumb, when Janardana (in<br>reply addressed that son of Pritha) saying, 'Thou art mine and I am<br>thine, while all that is mine is thine also! He that hateth thee hateth<br>me as well, and he that followeth thee followeth me! O thou irrepressible<br>one, thou art Nara and I am Narayana or Hari! We are the Rishis Nara and<br>Narayana born in the world of men for a special purpose. O Partha, thou<br>art from me and I am from thee! O bull of the Bharata race, no one can<br>understand the difference that is between us!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'When the illustrious Kesava had said so in the<br>midst of that assembly of brave kings, all excited with anger, Panchali<br>surrounded by Dhrishtadyumna and her other heroic brothers, approached<br>him of eyes like lotus leaves seated with his cousins, and, desirous of<br>protection, addressed in angry accents that refuge of all, saying, 'Asita<br>and Devala have said that in the matter of the creation of all things,<br>thou hast been indicated (by the sages) as the only Prajapati and the<br>Creator of all the worlds! And, O irrepressible one, Jamadagnya sayeth<br>that thou art Vishnu, and, O slayer of Madhu, that thou art (embodiment<br>of) Sacrifice, Sacrificer and he for whom the sacrifice is performed!<br>And, O best of male beings, the Rishis indicate thee as Forgiveness and<br>Truth! Kasyapa hath said that thou art Sacrifice sprung from Truth! O<br>exalted one, Narada calleth thee the god of the Sadhyas, and of the<br>Sivas, as alone the Creator and the Lord of all things. And, O tiger<br>among men, thou repeatedly sportest with the gods including, Brahma and<br>Sankara and Sakra even as children sporting with their toys! And, O<br>exalted one, the firmament is covered by thy head, and the earth by thy<br>feet; these worlds are as thy womb and thou art the Eternal one! With<br>Rishis sanctified by Vedic lore and asceticism, and whose souls have been<br>purified by penance, and who are contented with soul-vision, thou art the<br>best of all objects! And, O chief of all male beings; thou art the refuge<br>of all royal sages devoted to virtuous acts, never turning their backs on<br>the field of the battle, and possessed of every accomplishment! Thou art<br>the Lord of all, thou art Omnipresent, thou art the Soul of all things,<br>and thou art the active power pervading everything! The rulers of the<br>several worlds, those worlds themselves, the stellar conjunctions, the<br>ten points of the horizon, the firmament, the moon, and the sun, are all<br>established in thee! And, O mighty-armed one, the morality of (earthly)<br>creatures, the immortality of the universe, are established in thee! Thou<br>art the Supreme lord of all creatures, celestial or human! Therefore it<br>is, O slayer of Madhu, that impelled by the affection thou bearest me<br>that I will relate to thee my griefs! O Krishna, how could one like me,<br>the wife of Pritha's sons, the sister of Dhrishtadyumna, and the friend<br>of thee, be dragged to the assembly! Alas, during my season, stained with<br>blood, with but a single cloth on, trembling all over, and weeping, I was<br>dragged to the court of the Kurus! Beholding me, stained with blood in<br>the presence of those kings in the assembly, the wicked sons of<br>Dhritarashtra laughed at me! O slayer of Madhu, while the sons of Pandu<br>and the Panchalas and the Vrishnis lived, they dared express the desire<br>of using me as their slave! O Krishna, I am according to the ordinance,<br>the daughter in-law of both Dhritarashtra and Bhishma! Yet, O slayer of<br>Madhu, they wished to make of me a slave by force! I blame the Pandavas<br>who are mighty and foremost in battle, for they saw (without stirring)<br>their own wedded wife known over all the world, treated with such<br>cruelty! Oh, fie on the might of Bhimasena, fie on the Gandiva of Arjuna,<br>for they, O Janardana, both suffered me to be thus disgraced by little<br>men! This eternal course of morality is ever followed by the<br>virtuous&#8212;viz., that the husband, however weak, protecteth his wedded<br>wife! By protecting the wife one protecteth his offspring and by<br>protecting the offspring one protecteth his own self! One's own self is<br>begotten on one's wife, and therefore it is that the wife is called Jaya.<br>A wife also should protect her lord, remembering that he is to take his<br>birth in her womb! The Pandavas never forsake the person that soliciteth<br>their protection, and yet they abandoned me who solicited it! By my five<br>husbands five sons of exceeding energy have been born of me: Prativindhya<br>by Yudhishthira, Sutasoma by Vrikodara, Srutakirti by Arjuna, Satanika by<br>Nakula and Srutakarman by the youngest, all of them of energy that cannot<br>be baffled. For their sake, O Janardana, it was necessary to protect me!<br>Even as (thy son) Pradyumna, they are, O Krishna, mighty warriors all!<br>They are foremost of bowmen, and invincible in battle by any foe! Why do<br>they bear the wrongs inflicted (on me) by the sons of Dhritarashtra of<br>such contemptible strength? Deprived of their kingdom by deception, the<br>Pandavas were made bondsmen and I myself was dragged to the assembly<br>while in my season, and having only a single cloth on! Fie on that<br>Gandiva which none else can string save Arjuna and Bhima and thyself, O<br>slayer of Madhu! Fie on the strength of Bhima, and fie on the prowess of<br>Arjuna, since, O Krishna, Duryodhana (after what he had done) hath drawn<br>breath even for a moment! He it is, O slayer of Madhu, who formerly drove<br>the guileless Pandavas with their mother from the kingdom, while they<br>were children still engaged in study and the observance of their vows. It<br>is that sinful wretch, who, horrible to relate, mixed in Bhima's food<br>fresh and virulent poison in full dose. But, O Janardana, Bhima digested<br>that poison with the food, without sustaining any injury, for, O best of<br>men and mighty-armed one, Bhima's days had not been ended! O Krishna, it<br>is Duryodhana who at the house standing by the banyan called Pramana<br>bound Bhima sleeping unsuspectingly, and casting him into the Ganges<br>returned to the city. But the powerful Bhimasena the son of Kunti,<br>possessed of mighty arms, on waking from sleep, tore his bonds and rose<br>from the water. It is Duryodhana, who caused venomous black-cobras to<br>bite all over the body of Bhimasena, but that slayer of foes died not.<br>Awaking, the son of Kunti smashed all the serpents and with his left hand<br>killed (the agent, viz.) the favourite charioteer of Duryodhana. Again,<br>while the children were asleep at Varanavata with their mother, it is he<br>who set fire to the house intending to burn them to death. Who is there<br>capable of doing such an act? It was then that the illustrious Kunti,<br>overtaken by this calamity, and surrounded by the flames, began to cry<br>out in terror, speaking to the children, 'Alas, I am undone! How shall we<br>escape from this fire today! Alas, I shall meet with destruction with my<br>little children!' Then Bhima, possessed of mighty arms, and prowess like<br>unto the force of the wind, comforted his illustrious mother as also his<br>brothers, saying, 'Like that king of birds, Garuda, the son of Vinata, I<br>will spring up into the air. We have no fear from this fire'. And then<br>taking his mother on his left flank, and the king in his right, and the<br>twins on each shoulder, and Vivatsu on his back, the mighty Vrikodara,<br>thus taking all of them, at one leap cleared the fire and delivered his<br>mother and brother from the conflagration. Setting out that night with<br>their renowned mother, they came near the forest of Hidimva. And while<br>fatigued and distressed, they were sleeping fast with her, a Rakshasa<br>woman called Hidimva approached them. Beholding the Pandavas with their<br>mother asleep on the ground, influenced by desire she sought to have<br>Bhimasena for her lord. The weak one then took up Bhima's feet on her lap<br>to press them with her soft hands. The mighty Bhima of immeasurable<br>energy, of prowess that could not be baffled, then woke from sleep, and<br>asked her, saying, 'O thou of faultless features, what dost thou wish<br>here?' Thus asked by him, the Rakshasa lady of faultless features,<br>capable, besides, of assuming any form at will, replied unto the<br>high-souled Bhima, saying, 'Do ye speedily fly from this place! My<br>brother gifted with strength will come to slay ye! Therefore speed and<br>tarry not!' But Bhima haughtily said, 'I do not fear him! If he cometh<br>here, I will slay him!' Hearing their converse, that vilest of cannibals<br>came to the spot. Of frightful form and dreadful to behold, uttering loud<br>cries as he came, the Rakshasa said, 'O Hidimva, with whom dost thou<br>converse? Bring him unto me, I will eat him up. It behoveth thee to tarry<br>not.' But moved by compassion, the Rakshasa lady of faultless features<br>and pure heart said nothing out of pity. Then the man-eating monster,<br>uttering dreadful cries, rushed at Bhima with great force. And<br>approaching him furiously, the mighty cannibal, possessed with rage,<br>caught hold of Bhima's hand with his own and clenching fast his other<br>hand and making it hard as the thunder-bolt of Indra, suddenly struck<br>Bhima a blow that descended with the force of lightning. His hand having<br>been seized by the Rakshasa, Vrikodara, without being able to brook it,<br>flew into a rage. Then a dreadful combat took place between Bhimasena and<br>Hidimva, both skilled in all weapons and which was like unto the<br>encounter of Vasava with Vritra. And, O sinless one, after sporting with<br>the Rakshasa for a long while the powerful Bhima of mighty energy slew<br>the cannibal when the latter had become weak with exertion. Then having<br>slain Hidimva, and taking (his sister) Hidimva at their head, of whom was<br>(subsequently) born Ghatotkacha, Bhima and his brothers went away. Then<br>all those repressors of their foes, accompanied by their mother and<br>surrounded by many Brahmanas proceeded towards Ekachakra. In the matter<br>of this their journey, Vyasa ever engaged in their welfare had become<br>their counsellor. Then arriving at Ekachakra, the Pandavas of rigid vows<br>there also slew a mighty cannibal, Vaka by name, terrible as Hidimva<br>himself. And having slain that fierce cannibal, Bhima that foremost of<br>smiters, went with all his brothers to the capital of Drupada. And, O<br>Krishna, as thou hadst acquired Rukmini, the daughter of Bhishmaka, even<br>so Savyasachin, while residing there, obtained me! O slayer of Madhu,<br>Arjuna won me in the Swayamvara, having performed a feat difficult of<br>achievement by others and having fought also with the assembled kings!<br><br>'Thus, O Krishna, afflicted with numerous griefs, and in great distress,<br>am I living, with Dhaumya at our head, but deprived of the company of the<br>adorable Kunti! Why do these that are gifted with strength and possessed<br>of the prowess of the lion, sit indifferently, beholding me thus<br>afflicted by enemies so despicable? Suffering such wrongs at the hands of<br>wicked and evil-doing foes of small strength, am I to burn in grief so<br>long? Born I was in a great race, coming into the world in an<br>extraordinary way! I am also the beloved wife of the Pandavas, and the<br>daughter-in-law of the illustrious Pandu! The foremost of women and<br>devoted to my husbands, even I, O Krishna, was seized by hair, O slayer<br>of Madhu, in the sight of the Pandavas, each of whom is like an Indra<br>himself!<br><br>'Saying this the mild-speeched Krishna hid her face with her soft hands<br>like the buds of lotus, and began to weep. And the tears of Panchali<br>begot of grief washed her deep, plump and graceful breasts crowned with<br>auspicious marks. And wiping her eyes and sighing frequently she said<br>these words angrily and in a choked voice, 'Husbands, or sons, or<br>friends, or brothers, or father, have I none! Nor have I thee, O thou<br>slayer of Madhu, for ye all, beholding me treated so cruelly by inferior<br>foes, sit still unmoved! My grief at Karna's ridicule is incapable of<br>being assuaged! On these grounds I deserve to be ever protected by thee,<br>O Kesava, viz., our relationship, thy respect (for me), our friendship,<br>and thy lordship (over me)<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'In that assembly of heroes Vasudeva then spake<br>unto the weeping Draupadi as follows, 'O fair lady, the wives of those<br>with whom thou art angry, shall weep even like thee, beholding their<br>husbands dead on the ground, weltering in blood and their bodies covered<br>with the arrows of Vivatsu! Weep not, lady, for I will exert to the<br>utmost of my powers for the sons of Pandu! I promise thou shalt (once<br>more) be the queen of kings! The heavens might fall, or the Himavat might<br>split, the earth might be rent, or the waters of the ocean might dry up,<br>but my words shall never be futile!' Hearing those words of Achyuta in<br>reply, Draupadi looked obliquely at her third husband (Arjuna). And, O<br>mighty king, Arjuna said unto Draupadi, 'O thou of beautiful coppery<br>eyes, grieve not! O illustrious one, it shall be even as the slayer of<br>Madhu hath said! It can never be otherwise, O beautiful one!'<br><br>"Dhrishtadyumna said, 'I will slay Drona, Sikhandin will slay the<br>grandfather. And Bhimasena will slay Duryodhana, and Dhananjaya will slay<br>Karna. And, O sister, assisted by Rama and Krishna, we are invincible in<br>battle by even the slayer himself of Vritra&#8212;what are the sons of<br>Dhritarashtra?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'After these words had been spoken, all the<br>heroes there turned their faces towards Vasudeva, who then in their midst<br>began to speak as follows.'"
