                            Vaisampayana said, "Once upon a time Yudhishthira, while living at that<br>place, addressed Krishna, his brother, and the Brahmanas, saying, 'By us<br>have been attentively seen one after another sacred and auspicious<br>tirthas, and woods, delightful to beheld, which had ere this been visited<br>by the celestials and the high-souled sages, and which had been<br>worshipped by the Brahmanas. And in various sacred asylums we have<br>performed ablutions with Brahmanas, and have heard from them the lives<br>and acts of many sages, and also of many royal sages of yore, and other<br>pleasant stories. And with flowers and water have the gods been<br>worshipped by us. And with offerings of fruits and roots as available at<br>each place we have gratified the pitris. And with the high-souled ones<br>have we performed ablutions in all sacred and beautiful mountains and<br>lakes, and also in the highly sacred ocean. And with the Brahmanas we<br>have bathed in the Ila, and in the Saraswati, and in the Sindhu, and in<br>the Yamuna, and in the Narmada, and in various other romantic tirthas.<br>And having passed the source of the Ganga, we have seen many a lovely<br>hill and the Himalaya mountains, inhabited by various species of birds,<br>and also the jujube named Visala, where there is the hermitage of Nara<br>and Narayana. And (finally) we have beheld this unearthly lake, held in<br>veneration by the Siddhas, the gods and the sages. In fact, O foremost of<br>Brahmanas, we have one by one carefully seen all celebrated and sacred<br>spots in company with the high-souled Lomasa. Now, O Bhima, how shall we<br>repair to the sacred abode of Vaisravana, inhabited by the Siddhas? Do<br>thou think of the means of entering (the same)."<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "When that king had said this, an aerial voice spake,<br>saying. 'Thou will not be able to go to that inaccessible spot. By this<br>very way, do thou repair from this region of Kuvera to the place whence<br>thou hadst come even to the hermitage of Nara and Narayana, known by the<br>name of Vadari. Thence, O Kaunteya. thou wilt repair to the hermitage of<br>Vrishaparva, abounding in flowers and fruit, and inhabited by the Siddhas<br>and the Charanas. Having passed that, O Partha, thou wilt proceed to the<br>hermitage of Arshtisena, and from thence thou wilt behold the abode of<br>Kuvera.' Just at that moment the breeze became fresh, and gladsome and<br>cool and redolent of unearthly fragrance; and it showered blossoms, And<br>on hearing the celestial voice from the sky, they all were amazed,&#8212;more<br>specially those earthly rishis and the Brahmanas. On hearing this mighty<br>marvel, the Brahmana Dhaumya, said, 'This should not be gainsaid. O<br>Bharata, let this be so.' Thereupon, king Yudhishthira obeyed him. And<br>having returned to the hermitage of Nara and Narayana, he began to dwell<br>pleasantly, surrounded by Bhimasena and his other brothers, Panchali the<br>Brahmanas."
