                            Janamejaya said, "O thou of ascetic wealth! when the sons of Pandu and<br>the Vrishnis reached the holy spot Prabhasa, what did they do and what<br>conversation was held there by them, for all of them were of mighty<br>souls, proficient in all the branches of science and both the Vrishnis<br>and the sons of Pandu held one another in friendly estimation."<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "When the Vrishnis reached the holy spot Prabhasa, the<br>sacred landing-place on the coast of the sea, they surrounded the sons of<br>Pandu and waited upon them. Then Valarama, resembling in hue the milk of<br>the cow and the Kunda flower and the moon and the silver and the lotus<br>root and who wore a wreath made of wild flowers and who had the<br>ploughshare for his arms, spake to the lotuseyed one, saying, 'O Krishna,<br>I do not see that the practice of virtue leads to any good or that<br>unrighteous practices can cause evil, since the magnanimous Yudhishthira<br>is in this miserable state, with matted hair, a resident of the wood, and<br>for his garment wearing the bark of trees. And Duryodhana is now ruling<br>the earth, and the ground doth not yet swallow him up. From this, a<br>person of limited sense would believe a vicious course of life is<br>preferable to a virtuous one. When Duryodhana is in a flourishing state<br>and Yudhishthira, robbed of his throne, is suffering thus, what should<br>people do in such a matter?&#8212;This is the doubt that is now perplexing all<br>men. Here is the lord of men sprung from the god of virtue, holding fast<br>to a righteous path, strictly truthful and of a liberal heart. This son<br>of Pritha would give up his kingdom and his pleasure but would not swerve<br>from the righteous path, in order to thrive. How is it that Bhishma and<br>Kripa and the Brahmana Drona and the aged king, the senior member of the<br>house, are living happily, after having banished the sons of Pritha? Fie<br>upon the vicious-minded leaders of Bharata's race! What will that sinner,<br>the chieftain of the earth, say to the departed forefathers of his race,<br>when the wretch will meet them in the world to come? Having hurled from<br>the throne his in-offensive sons, will he be able to declare that he had<br>treated them in a blameless way? He doth not now see with his mind's eye<br>how he hath become so sightless, and on account of what act he hath grown<br>blind among the kings of this entire earth. Is it not because he hath<br>banished Kunit's son from his kingdom? I have no doubt that<br>Vichitravirya's son, when he with his sons perpetrated this inhuman act,<br>beheld on the spot where dead bodies are burnt, flowering trees of a<br>golden hue. Verily he must have asked them, when those stood before him<br>with their shoulders projected forward towards him, and with their large<br>red eyes staring at him, and he must have listened to their evil advice,<br>since he fearlessly sent away Yudhishthira to the forest, who had all his<br>weapons of war with him and was borne company by his younger brothers.<br>This Bhima here, whose voracious appetite is like that of a wolf, is able<br>to destroy with the sole strength of his powerful arms, and without the<br>help of any weapons of war, a formidable array of hostile troops. The<br>forces in the field of battle were utterly unmanned on hearing his<br>war-cry. And now the strong one is suffering from hunger and thirst, and<br>is emaciated with toilsome journeys. But when he will take up in his hand<br>arrows and diverse other weapons of war, and meet his foes in the field<br>of battle, he will then remember the sufferings of his exceedingly<br>miserable forest-life, and kill his enemies to a man: of a certainty do I<br>anticipate this. There is not throughout the whole world a single soul<br>who can boast of strength and prowess equal to his. And his body, alas!<br>is emaciated with cold, and heat and winds. But when he will stand up for<br>fight, he will not leave a single man out of his foes. This powerful<br>hero, who is a very great warrior when mounted on a car&#8212;this Bhima, of<br>appetite rivalling a wolf's conquered single-handed all the rulers of men<br>in the east, together with, those who followed them in battle; and he<br>returned from those wars safe and uninjured. And that same Bhima,<br>miserably dressed in the bark of trees, is now leading a wretched life in<br>the woods. This powerful Sahadeva vanquished all the kings in the south;<br>those lords of men who had gathered on the coast of the sea,&#8212;look at him<br>now in an anchorite's dress. Valiant in battle Nakula vanquished<br>single-handed the kings who ruled the regions towards the west,&#8212;and he<br>now walks about the wood, subsisting on fruit and roots, with a matted<br>mass of hair on the head, and his body besmeared all over with dirt. This<br>daughter of a king, who is a great soldier when mounted on a car, took<br>her rise from beneath the altar, during the pomp of sacrificial rites.<br>She hath been always accustomed to a life of happiness; how is she now<br>enduring this exceedingly miserable life in this wood! And the son of the<br>god of virtue,&#8212;virtue which stands at the head of all the there pursuits<br>of life&#8212;and the son of the wind-god and also the son of the lord of<br>celestials, and those two sons of the celestial physicians,&#8212;being the<br>sons of all those gods and always accustomed to a life of happiness, how<br>are they living in this wood, deprived of all comforts? When the son of<br>Virtue met with defeat, and when his wife, his brothers, his followers,<br>and himself were all driven forth, and Duryodhana began to flourish, why<br>did not the earth subside with all its hills?"
