                            (Markandeya-Samasya Parva)<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "While they were dwelling at that place, there set in<br>the season of the rains, the season that puts an end to the hot weather<br>and is delightful to all animated beings. Then the black clouds, rumbling<br>loudly, and covering the heavens and the cardinal points, ceaselessly<br>rained during day and night. These clouds, counted by hundreds and by<br>thousands, looked like domes in the rainy season. From the earth<br>disappeared the effulgence of the sun; its place was taken by the<br>stainless lustre of the lightning; the earth became delightful to all,<br>being overgrown with grass, with gnats and reptiles in their joy; it was<br>bathed with rain and possessed with calm. When the waters had covered<br>all, it could not be known whether the ground was at all even or<br>uneven;&#8212;whether there were rivers or trees or hills. At the end of the<br>hot season, the rivers added beauty to the woods being themselves full of<br>agitated waters, flowing with great force and resembling serpents in the<br>hissing sound they made. The boars, the stags and the birds, while the<br>rain was falling upon them began to utter sounds of various kinds which<br>could be heard within the forest tracts. The chatakas, the peacocks and<br>the host of male Kohilas and the excited frogs, all ran about in joy.<br>Thus while the Pandavas were roaming about in the deserts and sandy<br>tracts, the happy season of rain, so various in aspect and resounding<br>with clouds passed away. Then set in the season of autumn, thronged with<br>ganders and cranes and full of joy; then the forest tracts were overrun<br>with grass; the river turned limpid; the firmament and stars shone<br>brightly., And the autumn, thronged with beasts and birds, was joyous and<br>pleasant for the magnanimous sons of Pandu. Then were seen nights, that<br>were free from dust and cool with clouds and beautified by myriads of<br>planets and stars and the moon. And they beheld rivers and ponds, adorned<br>with lilies and white lotuses, full of cool and pleasant water. And while<br>roving by the river Saraswati whose banks resembled the firmament itself<br>and were overgrown with canes, and as such abounded in sacred baths,<br>their joy was great. And those heroes who wielded powerful bows, were<br>specially glad to see the pleasant river Saraswati, with its limpid<br>waters full to the brim. And, O Janamejaya, the holiest night, that of<br>the full moon in the month of Kartika in the season of autumn, was spent<br>by them while dwelling there! And the sons of Pandu, the best of the<br>descendants of Bharata, spent that auspicious juncture with righteous and<br>magnanimous saints devoted to penance. And as soon as the dark fortnight<br>set in immediately after, the sons of Pandu entered the forest named the<br>Kamyaka, accompanied by Dhananjaya and their charioteers and cooks."
