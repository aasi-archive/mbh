                            "Markandeya continued, 'O thou conqueror of hostile cities, in this<br>connection Saraswati too, when interrogated by that intelligent Muni<br>Tarkshya, had said (this). Do thou listen to her words! Tarkshya had<br>asked, saying, 'Excellent lady, what is the best thing for a man to do<br>here below, and how must he act so that he may not deviate from (the path<br>of) virtue. Tell me all this, O beautiful lady, so that instructed by<br>thee, I may not fall away from the path of virtue! When and how must one<br>offer oblations to the (sacred) fire and when must he worship so that<br>virtue may not be compromised? Tell me all this, O excellent lady, so<br>that I may live without any passions, craving, or desire, in this world.'<br><br>"Markandeya continued, 'Thus questioned by that cheerful Muni and seeing<br>him eager to learn and endued with high intelligence, Saraswati addressed<br>these pious and beneficial words to the Brahmana, Tarkshya.'<br><br>"Saraswati said, 'He who is engaged in the study of the Vedas, and with<br>sanctity and equanimity perceives the supreme Godhead in his proper<br>sphere, ascends the celestial regions and attains supreme beatitude with<br>the Immortals. Many large, beautiful, pellucid and sacred lakes are<br>there, abounding with fish, flowers, and golden lilies. They are like<br>shrines and their very sight is calculated to assuage grief. Pious men,<br>distinctively worshipped by virtuous well-adorned golden-complexioned<br>Apsaras, dwell in contentment on the shores of those lakes. He who giveth<br>cows (to Brahmanas) attaineth the highest regions; by giving bullocks he<br>reacheth the solar regions, by giving clothes he getteth to the lunar<br>world, and by giving gold he attaineth to the state of the Immortals. He<br>who giveth a beautiful cow with a fine calf, and which is easily milked<br>and which doth not run away, is (destined) to live for as many years in<br>the celestial regions as there are hairs on the body of that animal. He<br>who giveth a fine, strong, powerful, young bullock, capable of drawing<br>the plough and bearing burdens, reacheth the regions attained by men who<br>give ten cows. When a man bestoweth a well-caparisoned kapila cow with a<br>brazen milk-pail and with money given afterwards, that cow becoming, by<br>its own distinguished qualities, a giver of everything reacheth the side<br>of the man who gave her away. He who giveth away cows, reapeth<br>innumerable fruits of his action, measured by the hairs on the body of<br>that animal. He also saveth (from perdition) in the next world his sons<br>and grandsons and ancestors to the seventh generation. He who presenteth<br>to a Brahmana, sesamum made up in the form of a cow, having horns made of<br>gold, with money besides, and a brazen milk-pail, subsequently attaineth<br>easily to the regions of the Vasus. By his own acts man descends into the<br>darksome lower regions, infested by evil spirits (of his own passions)<br>like a ship tossed by the storm in the high seas; but the gift of kine to<br>Brahmanas saves him in the next world. He who giveth his daughter in<br>marriage, in the Brahma form, who bestoweth gifts of land on Brahmanas<br>and who duly maketh other presents, attaineth to the regions of<br>Purandara. O Tarkshya, the virtuous man who is constant in presenting<br>oblations to the sacred fire for seven years, sanctifieth by his own<br>action seven generations up and down.'<br><br>"Tarkshya said, 'O beautiful lady, explain to me who ask thee, the rules<br>for the maintenance of the sacred fire as inculcated in the Vedas. I<br>shall now learn from thee the time-honoured rules for perpetually keeping<br>up the sacred fire.'"
