                            "Karna said, 'As thou, O lord of splendour, knowest me for thy<br>worshipper, so also thou knowest that there is nothing which I cannot<br>give away in charity, O thou of fiery rays! Neither my wives, nor my<br>sons, nor my own self, nor my friends, are so dear to me as thou, on<br>account of the veneration I feel for thee, O lord of splendour! Thou<br>knowest, O maker of light, that high-souled persons bear a loving regard<br>for their dear worshippers. Karna revereth me and is dear to me. He<br>knoweth no other deity in heaven,&#8212;thinking this thou hast, O lord, said<br>unto me what is for my benefit. Yet, O thou of bright rays, again do I<br>beseech thee with bended head, again do I place myself in thy hands. I<br>will repeat the answer I have already given. It behoveth thee to forgive<br>me! Death itself is not fraught with such terrors for me as untruth! As<br>regards especially the Brahmanas, again, I do not hesitate to yield up my<br>life even for them! And, O divine one, respecting what thou hast said<br>unto me of Phalguna, the son of Pandu, let thy grief born of thy anxiety<br>of heart, O lord of splendour, be dispelled touching him and myself; for<br>I shall surely conquer Arjuna in battle! Thou knowest, O deity, that I<br>have great strength of weapons obtained from Jamadagnya and the<br>high-souled Drona. Permit me now, O foremost of celestials, to observe my<br>vow, so that unto him of the thunderbolt coming to beg of me, I may give<br>away even my life!'<br><br>"Surya said, 'If O son, thou givest away thy ear-rings to the wielder of<br>the thunder-bolt, O thou of mighty strength, thou shouldst also, for the<br>purpose of securing victory, speak unto him, saying,&#8212;O thou of a hundred<br>sacrifices, I shall give thee ear-rings under a condition.&#8212;Furnished<br>with the ear-rings, thou art certainly incapable of being slain by any<br>being. Therefore, it is, O son, that desirous of beholding thee slain in<br>battle by Arjuna, the destroyer of the Danavas desireth to deprive thee<br>of thy ear-rings. Repeatedly adoring with truthful words that lord of the<br>celestials, viz., Purandara armed with weapons incapable of being<br>frustrated, do thou also beseech him, saying, 'Give me an infallible dart<br>capable of slaying all foes, and I will, O thousand-eyed deity, give the<br>ear-rings with the excellent coat of mail!' On this condition shouldst<br>thou give the ear-rings unto Sakra. With that dart, O Karna, thou wilt<br>slay foes in battle: for, O mighty-armed one, that dart of the chief of<br>the celestials doth not return to the hand that hurleth it, without<br>slaying enemies by hundreds and by thousands!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Having said this, the thousand-rayed deity<br>suddenly vanished away. The next day, after having told his prayers,<br>Karna related his dream unto the Sun. And Vrisha related unto him the<br>vision he had seen, and all that had passed between them in the night.<br>Thereupon, having heard everything, that enemy of Swarbhanu, that lord,<br>the resplendent and divine Surya, said unto him with a smile, 'It is even<br>so!' Then Radha's son, that slayer of hostile heroes, knowing all about<br>the matter, and desirous of obtaining the dart, remained in expectation<br>of Vasava."
