                            Vaisampayana said, "One day, the great Rishi Lomasa in course of his<br>wanderings, went to the abode of Indra, desirous of beholding the lord of<br>the celestials. And the great Muni, having approached the chief of the<br>gods, bowed to him respectfully. And he beheld the son of Pandu occupying<br>half of the seat of Vasava. And worshipped by the great Rishis, that<br>foremost of Brahmanas sat on an excellent seat at the desire of Sakra.<br>And beholding Arjuna seated on Indra's seat, the Rishi began to think as<br>to how Arjuna who was a Kshatriya had attained to the seat of Sakra<br>himself. What acts of merit had been performed by him and what regions,<br>had been conquered by him (by ascetic merit), that he had obtained a seat<br>that was worshipped by the gods themselves? And as the Rishi was employed<br>with these thoughts, Sakra, the slayer of Vritra, came to know of them.<br>And having known them, the lord of Sachi addressed Lomasa with a smile<br>and said, 'Listen, O Brahmarshi, about what is now passing in thy mind.<br>This one is no mortal though he hath taken his birth among men. O great<br>Rishi, the mighty-armed hero is even my son born of Kunti. He hath come<br>hither, in order to acquire weapons for some purpose. Alas! dost thou not<br>recognise him as an ancient Rishi of the highest merit? Listen to me, O<br>Brahamana, as I tell thee who is and why he hath come to me. Those<br>ancient and excellent Rishis who were known by the names of Nara and<br>Narayana are, know, O Brahmana, none else than Hrishikesa and Dhananjaya.<br>And those Rishis, celebrated throughout the three worlds, and known by<br>the names of Nara and Narayana have, for the accomplishment of a certain<br>purpose, been born on earth&#8212;for the acquisition of virtue. That sacred<br>asylum which even gods and illustrious Rishis are not competent to<br>behold, and which is known throughout the world by the name of Vadari,<br>and situate by the source of the Ganga, which is worshipped by the<br>Siddhas and the Charanas, was the abode, O Brahmana, of Vishnu and<br>Jishnu. Those Rishis of blazing splendour have, O Brahmarshi, at my<br>desire, been born on earth, and endued with mighty energy, will lighten<br>the burden thereof. Besides this, there are certain Asuras known as<br>Nivatakavachas, who, proud of the boon they have acquired, are employed<br>in doing us injuries. Boastful of their strength, they are even now<br>planning the destruction of the gods, for, having received a boon, they<br>no longer regard the gods. Those fierce and mighty Danavas live in the<br>nether regions. Even all the celestials together are incapable of<br>fighting with them. The blessed Vishnu&#8212;the slayer of Madhu&#8212;he, indeed<br>who is known on earth as Kapila, and whose glance alone, O exalted one,<br>destroyed the illustrious sons of Sagara, when they approached him with<br>loud sounds in the bowels of the earth,&#8212;that illustrious and invincible<br>Hari is capable, O Brahmana of doing us a great service. Either he or<br>Partha or both may do us that great service, without doubt. Verily as the<br>illustrious Hari had slain the Nagas in the great lake, he, by sight<br>alone, is capable of slaying those Asuras called the Nivatakavachas,<br>along with their followers. But the slayer of Madhu should not be urged<br>when the task is insignificant. A mighty mass of energy that he is. It<br>swelleth to increasing proportions, it may consume the whole universe.<br>This Arjuna also is competent to encounter them all, and the hero having<br>slain them in battle, will go back to the world of men. Go thou at my<br>request to earth. Thou wilt behold the brave Yudhishthira living in the<br>woods of Kamyaka. And for me tell thou the virtuous Yudhishthira of<br>unbaffled prowess in battle, that he should not be anxious on account of<br>Phalguna, for that hero will return to earth a thorough master of<br>weapons, for without sanctified prowess of arms, and without skill in<br>weapons, he would not be able to encounter Bhishma and Drona and others<br>in battle. Thou wilt also represent unto Yudhishthira that the<br>illustrious and mighty-armed Gudakesa, having obtained weapons, hath also<br>mastered the science of celestial dancing and music both instrumental and<br>vocal. And thou wilt also tell him, O king of men, O slayer of foes,<br>thyself also, accompanied by all thy brothers, should see the various<br>sacred shrines. For having bathed in different sacred waters, thou wilt<br>be cleansed from thy sins, and the fever of thy heart will abate. And<br>then thou wilt be able to enjoy thy kingdom, happy in the thought that<br>thy sins have been washed off. And, O foremost of Brahmanas, endued with<br>ascetic power, it behoveth thee also to protect Yudhishthira during his<br>wandering over the earth. Fierce Rakshasas ever live in mountain<br>fastnesses and rugged steppes. Protect thou the king from those<br>cannibals.'<br><br>"After Mahendra had spoken thus unto Lomasa, Vibhatsu also reverently<br>addressed that Rishi, saying, 'Protect thou ever the son of Pandu. O best<br>of men, let the king, O great Rishi, protected by thee, visit the various<br>places of pilgrimage and give away unto Brahmanas in charity.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "The mighty ascetic Lomasa, having answered both<br>saying, 'So be it,' set out for the earth, desirous of arriving at<br>Kamvaka. And having arrived at those woods, he beheld the slayer of foes<br>and son of Kunti, king Yudhishthira the just, surrounded by ascetics and<br>his younger brothers."
