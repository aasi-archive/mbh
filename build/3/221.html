                            Markandeya continued, "Mudita, the favourite wife of the fire Swaha, used<br>to live in water. And Swaha who was the regent of the earth and sky beget<br>in that wife of his a highly sacred fire called Advanta. There is a<br>tradition amongst learned Brahmanas that this fire is the ruler and inner<br>soul of all creatures. He is worshipful, resplendent and the lord of all<br>the great Bhutas here. And that fire, under the name of Grihapati, is<br>ever worshipped at all sacrifices and conveys all the oblations that are<br>made in this world. That great son of Swaha&#8212;the great Adbhuta fire is<br>the soul of the waters and the prince and regent of the sky and the lord<br>of everything great. His (son), the Bharata fire, consumes the dead<br>bodies of all creatures. His first Kratu is known as Niyata at the<br>performance of the Agnishtoma sacrifice. That powerful prime fire (Swaha)<br>is always missed by the gods, because when he sees Niyata approaching him<br>he hides himself in the sea from fear of contamination. Searching for him<br>in every direction, the gods could not (once) find him out and on<br>beholding Atharvan the fire said to him, 'O valiant being, do thou carry<br>the oblations for the gods! I am disabled from want of strength.<br>Attaining the state of the red-eyed fire, do thou condescend to do me<br>this favour!' Having thus advised Atharvan, the fire went away to some<br>other place. But his place of concealment was divulged by the finny<br>tribe. Upon them the fire pronounced this curse in anger, 'You shall be<br>the food of all creatures in various ways.' And then that carrier of<br>oblations spoke unto Atharvan (as before). Though entreated by the gods,<br>he did not agree to continue carrying their oblations. He then became<br>insensible and instantly gave up the ghost. And leaving his material<br>body, he entered into the bowels of the earth. Coming into contact with<br>the earth, he created the different metals. Force and scent arose from<br>his pus; the Deodar pine from his bones; glass from his phlegm; the<br>Marakata jewel from his bile; and the black iron from his liver. And all<br>the world has been embellished with these three substances (wood, stone<br>and iron). The clouds were made from his nails, and corals from his<br>veins. And, O king, various other metals were produced from his body.<br>Thus leaving his material body, he remained absorbed in (spiritual)<br>meditation. He was roused by the penance of Bhrigu and Angiras. The<br>powerful fire thus gratified with penance, blazed forth intensely. But on<br>beholding the Rishi (Atharvan), he again sought his watery refuse. At<br>this extinction of the fire, the whole world was frightened, and sought<br>the protection of Atharvan, and the gods and others began to worship him.<br>Atharvan rummaged the whole sea in the presence of all those beings eager<br>with expectation, and finding out the fire, himself began the work of<br>creation. Thus in olden times the fire was destroyed and called back to<br>life by the adorable Atharvan. But now he invariably carries the<br>oblations of all creatures. Living in the sea and travelling about<br>various countries, he produced the various fires mentioned in the Vedas.<br><br>The river Indus, the five rivers (of the Punjab), the Sone, the Devika,<br>the Saraswati, the Ganga, the Satakumbha, the Sarayu, the Gandaki, the<br>Charmanwati, the Mahi, the Medha, the Medhatithi, the three rivers<br>Tamravati, the Vetravati, and the Kausiki; the Tamasa, the Narmada, the<br>Godavari, the Vena, the Upavena, the Bhima, the Vadawa, the Bharati, the<br>Suprayoga, the Kaveri, the Murmura, the Tungavenna, the Krishnavenna and<br>the Kapila, these rivers, O Bharata, are said to be the mothers of the<br>fires! The fire called Adbhuta had a wife of the name of Priya, and Vibhu<br>was the eldest of his sons by her. There are as many different kinds of<br>Soma sacrifices as the number of fires mentioned before. All this race of<br>fires, first-born of the spirit of Brahma, sprang also from the race of<br>Atri. Atri in his own mind conceived these sons, desirous of extending<br>the creation. By this act, the fires came out of his own Brahmic frame. I<br>have thus narrated to thee the history of the origin of these fires. They<br>are great, resplendent, and unrivalled in power, and they are the<br>destroyers of darkness. Know that the powers of those fires are the same<br>as those of the Adbhuta fire as related in the Vedas. For all these fires<br>are one and same. This adorable being, the first born fire, must be<br>considered as one. For like the Jyotishtoma sacrifice he came out of<br>Angiras body in various forms. I have thus described to thee the history<br>of the great race of Agni (fires) who when duly worshipped with the<br>various hymns, carry the oblations of all creatures to the gods.
