                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O Vrikodara, there are mighty and powerful invisible<br>spirits at this place. We shall, however, pass it, through the merit of<br>our asceticism and Agnihotra sacrifices. O son of Kunti, do thou<br>therefore, restrain thy hunger and thirst by collecting thy energies, and<br>also, O Vrikodara have recourse to thy strength and cleverness. O Kunti's<br>son, thou hast heard what the sage (Lomasa) had said regarding mount<br>Kailasa. Ascertain, therefore, after deliberation, how Krishna will pass<br>the spot. Or, O mighty Bhima of large eyes, do return from hence, taking<br>with thee Sahadeva, and all our charioteers, cooks, servants, cars,<br>horses, and Brahmanas worn out with travel, while I together with Nakula<br>and the sage Lomasa of severe austerities proceed, subsisting on the<br>lightest fare and observing vows. Do thou in expectation of my return,<br>cautiously wait at the source of the Ganga, protecting Draupadi till I<br>come back.'<br><br>"Bhima replied, 'O descendant of Bharata, although this blessed princess<br>hath been sore afflicted by toil and distress, yet she easily proceedeth,<br>in the hope of beholding him of the white steeds (Arjuna). Thy dejection<br>also is already very great at not seeing the high-souled Arjuna, who<br>never retreateth from fight. O Bharata, it is superfluous then to say<br>that if thou seest neither myself nor Sahadeva nor Krishna, thy dejection<br>will certainly increase. The Brahmanas had better return with our<br>servants, charioteers cooks and whomsoever else thou mayst command. I<br>never shall leave thee in these rugged and inaccessible mountainous<br>regions, infested by Rakshasas. And, O tiger among men, also this<br>princess of high fortune, ever devoted to her lords, desireth not to<br>return without thee. Sahadeva is always devoted to thee; he too will<br>never retrace his steps. His disposition is known to me. O king, O mighty<br>monarch, we are all eager to behold Savyasachin, and therefore, will we<br>all go together. If we are unable to go over this mountain in our cars,<br>abounding as it doth in defiles, well, we would go on foot. Trouble<br>thyself not, O king, I shall carry Panchala's daughter wherever she will<br>be incapable of walking. O king, I have decided upon this. Therefore let<br>not thy mind be distracted. I shall also carry over inaccessible tracts<br>those tender-bodied heroes, the twins, the delight of their mother,<br>wherever they will be incapable of proceeding.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'May thy strength increase, O Bhima, as thou speakest<br>thus, and as thou boldly undertakest to carry the illustrious Panchali<br>and these twins. Blessed be thou! Such courage dwelleth not in any other<br>individual. May thy strength, fame, merit, and reputation increase! O<br>long-armed one, as thou offerest to carry Krishna and our brothers the<br>twins, exhaustion and defeat never be thine!"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Then the charming Krishna said with a smile, 'O<br>descendant of Bharata, I shall be able to go, and, therefore, be thou not<br>anxious on my account.'<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'Access to the mountain, Gandhamadana, is only to be<br>obtained by dint of asceticism. Therefore, O son of Kunti, shall we all<br>practise austerities, O king, Nakula, Sahadeva, Bhimasena, thou and<br>myself shall then see him of the white steeds, O Kunti's son.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "O king, thus conversing together, they saw with<br>delight the extensive domains of Suvahu, situated on the Himalayas<br>abounding in horses and elephants, densely inhabited by the Kiratas and<br>the Tanganas, crowded by hundreds of Pulindas, frequented by the<br>celestials, and rife with wonders. King Suvahu, the lord of the Pulindas,<br>cheerfully received them at the frontiers of his dominions, paying them<br>proper respect. Having been thus received with honour, and having dwelt<br>comfortably at this place, they started for the mountain Himalaya, when<br>the sun shone brightly in the firmament. And, O king, having entrusted to<br>the care of the lord of the Pulindas, all their servants&#8212;Indrasena and<br>the others,&#8212;and the cooks and the stewards, and Draupadi's<br>accoutrements, and every thing else, those mighty charioteers, the son of<br>the Kurus, endued with great prowess, set out from that country, and<br>began to proceed cautiously with Krishna,&#8212;all of them cheerful in the<br>expectation of beholding Arjuna."<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O Bhimasena, O Panchali, and ye twins, hearken unto<br>my words. The acts done (by a person) in a former birth do not perish,<br>(without producing their effects). Behold! Even we have become rangers of<br>the wilderness. Even to see Dhananjaya, exhausted and distressed as we<br>are, we have to bear each other, and pass through impassable places. This<br>burneth me even as fire doth a heap of cotton. O hero, I do not see<br>Dhananjaya at my side. I reside in the wood with my younger brothers,<br>anxious for beholding him. This thought, as also the memory of that grave<br>insult offered to Yajanaseni, consumes me. O Vrikodara, I do not see the<br>invincible Partha of strong bow and incomparable energy, and who is the<br>immediate elder to Nakula. For this, O Vrikodara, I am miserable. In<br>order to see that hero, Dhananjaya, firm in promise, for these five years<br>have I been wandering in various tirthas, and beautiful forests and lakes<br>and yet I do meet with him. For this, O Vrikodara, I am miserable. I do<br>not see the long-armed Gudakesa, of dark blue hue, and leonine gait. For<br>this, O Vrikodara, I am miserable. I do not see that foremost of Kurus,<br>accomplished in arms, skilful in fight, and matchless among bowmen. For<br>this, O Vrikodara, I am miserable. Distressed for I am I do not see that<br>son of Pritha, Dhananjaya, born under the influence of the star Phalguni;<br>ranging amidst foes even like Yama at the time of the universal<br>dissolution; possessed of the prowess of an elephant with the temporal<br>juice trickling down; endued with leonine shoulders; not inferior to<br>Sakra himself in prowess and energy; elder in years to the twins; of<br>white steeds; unrivalled in heroism; invincible; and wielding a strong<br>bow. For this, O Vrikodara, I am miserable. And he is always of a<br>forgiving temper,&#8212;even when insulted by the meanest individual. And he<br>conferreth benefit and protection to the righteous; but to that tortuous<br>person who by craft attempts to do him mischief, Dhananjaya is like unto<br>virulent poison, albeit that one were Sakra himself. And the mighty<br>Vibhatsu of immeasurable soul and possessing great strength, showeth<br>mercy and extendeth protection even to a foe when fallen. And he is the<br>refuge of us all and he crusheth his foes in fight. And he hath the power<br>to collect any treasure whatever, and he ministereth unto our happiness.<br>It was through his prowess that I had owned formerly measureless precious<br>jewels of various kinds which at present Syodhana hath usurped. It was by<br>his might, O hero, that I had possessed before that palatial amphitheatre<br>embellished with all manner of jewels, and celebrated throughout the<br>three worlds. O Pandu's son, in prowess, Phalguni is like unto Vasudeva,<br>and in fight he is invincible and unrivalled, even like unto Kartavirya.<br>Alas! I see him not, O Bhima. In might, that conqueror of foes goeth in<br>the wake of the invincible and most powerful Sankarshana (Valarama) and<br>Vasudeva. In strength of arms, and spirit, he is like unto Purandara<br>himself. And in swiftness, he is even as the wind, and in grace, as the<br>moon, and in ire, he is the eternal Death himself. O mighty-armed one,<br>with the object of beholding that war-like tiger among men, shall we<br>repair to the Gandhamadana mountain, where lies the hermitage of Nara and<br>Narayana at the site of the celebrated jujube tree, and which is<br>inhabited by the Yakshas. We shall see that best of mountains. And,<br>practising severe austerities only on foot we shall go to Kuvera's<br>beautiful lake guarded by Rakshasas. That place cannot be reached by<br>vehicles, O Vrikodara. Neither can cruel or avaricious, or irascible<br>people attain to that spot, O Bharata's son. O Bhima, in order to see<br>Arjuna, thither shall we repair, in company, with Brahmanas of strict<br>vows, girding on our swords, and wielding our bows. Those only that are<br>impure, meet with flies gad-flies, mosquitoes, tigers, lions, and<br>reptiles, but the pure never come across them. Therefore, regulating our<br>fare, and restraining our senses, we shall go to the Gandhamadana,<br>desirous of seeing Dhananjaya.'"
