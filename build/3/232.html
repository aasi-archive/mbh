                            "Draupadi said, 'I shall now indicate to thee, for attracting the heart<br>of thy husbands a way that is free from deceit. By adopting it duly, dear<br>friend, thou will be able to draw away thy lord from other females. In<br>all the worlds, including that of the celestials, there is no god equal,<br>O Satyabhama, unto the husband. When he is gratified with thee, thou<br>mayst have (from thy husband) every object of desire; when he is angry,<br>all these may be lost. It is from her husband that the wife obtaineth<br>offspring and various articles of enjoyment. It is from thy husband that<br>thou mayst have handsome beds and seats, and robes and garlands, and<br>perfumes, and great fame and heaven itself hereafter. One cannot obtain<br>happiness here by means that are easy. Indeed, the woman that is chaste,<br>obtains weal with woe. Always adore Krishna, therefore, with friendship<br>and love physical sufferings. And do thou also act in a way, by offering<br>handsome seats and excellent garlands and various perfumes and prompt<br>service, that he may be devoted to thee, thinking, 'I am truly loved by<br>her!' Hearing the voice of thy lord at the gate, rise thou up from thy<br>seat and stay in readiness within the room. And as soon as thou seest him<br>enter thy chamber, worship him by promptly offering him a seat and water<br>to wash his feet. And even when he commands a maidservant to do anything,<br>get thou up and do it thyself. Let Krishna understand this temper of thy<br>mind and know that thou adorest him with all thy heart. And, O<br>Satyabhama, whatever thy lord speaketh before thee, do not blab of it<br>even if it may not deserve concealment,&#8212;for if any of thy co-wives were<br>to speak of it unto Vasudeva, he might be irritated with thee. Feed thou<br>by every means in thy power those that are dear and devoted to thy lord<br>and always seek his good. Thou shouldst, however, always keep thyself<br>aloof from those that are hostile to and against thy lord and seek to do<br>him injury, as also from those that are addicted to deceit. Foregoing all<br>excitement and carelessness in the presence of men, conceal thy<br>inclinations by observing silence, and thou shouldst not stay or converse<br>in private even with thy sons, Pradyumna and Samva. Thou shouldst form<br>attachments with only such females as are high-born and sinless and<br>devoted to their lords, and thou shouldst always shun women that are<br>wrathful, addicted to drinks, gluttonous, thievish, wicked and fickle.<br>Behaviour such as this is reputable and productive of prosperity; and<br>while it is capable of neutralising hostility, it also leadeth to heaven.<br>Therefore, worship thou thy husband, decking thyself in costly garlands<br>and ornaments and smearing thyself with unguents and excellent perfumes."
