                            Vrihadaswa said, "There was a king named Nala, the son of Virasena. And<br>he was strong, and handsome, and well-versed in (the knowledge of)<br>horses, and possessed of every desirable accomplishment. And he was at<br>the head of all the kings, even like the lord of the celestials. And<br>exalted over all, he resembled the sun in glory. And he was the king of<br>the Nishadhas, intent on the welfare of the Brahmanas, versed in the<br>Vedas, and possessed of heroism. And he was truth-telling, fond of dice,<br>and the master of a mighty army. And he was the beloved of men and women,<br>and of great soul and subdued passions. And he was the protector (of<br>all), and the foremost of bowmen, and like unto Manu himself. And like<br>him, there was among the Vidarbhas (a king named) Bhima, of terrible<br>prowess, heroic and well-disposed towards his subjects and possessed of<br>every virtue. (But withal) he was childless. And with a fixed mind, he<br>tried his utmost for obtaining issue. And. O Bharata there came unto him<br>(once) a Brahmarshi named Damana. And, O king of kings, desirous of<br>having offspring, Bhima, versed in morality, with his queen gratified<br>that illustrious Rishi by a respectful reception. And Damana,<br>well-pleased, granted unto the king and his consort a boon in the form of<br>a jewel of a daughter, and three sons possessed of lofty souls and great<br>fame. (And they were called respectively) Damayanti, and Dama and Danta,<br>and illustrious Damana. And the three sons were possessed of every<br>accomplishment and terrible mien and fierce prowess. And the<br>slender-waisted Damayanti, in beauty and brightness, in good name and<br>grace and luck, became celebrated all over the world. And on her<br>attaining to age, hundreds of hand-maids, and female slaves, decked in<br>ornaments, waited upon her like Sachi herself. And Bhima's daughter of<br>faultless features, decked in every ornament, shone in the midst of her<br>hand-maids, like the luminous lightning of the clouds. And the large-eyed<br>damsel was possessed of great beauty like that of Sree herself. And<br>neither among celestials, nor among Yakshas, nor among men was anybody<br>possessed of such beauty, seen or heard of before. And the beautiful<br>maiden filled with gladness the hearts of even the gods. And that tiger<br>among men, Nala also had not his peer in the (three) worlds: for in<br>beauty he was like Kandarpa himself in his embodied form. And moved by<br>admiration, the heralds again and again celebrated the praises of Nala<br>before Damayanti and those of Damayanti before the ruler of the<br>Nishadhas. And repeatedly hearing of each other's virtues they conceived<br>an attachment towards each other not begot of sight, and that attachment,<br>O son of Kunti began to grow in strength. And then Nala was unable to<br>control the love that was in his bosom. And he began to pass much of his<br>time in solitude in the gardens adjoining the inner apartment (of his<br>palace). And there he saw a number of swans furnished with golden wings,<br>wandering in those woods. And from among them he caught one with his<br>hands. And thereupon the sky-ranging one said unto Nala. 'Deserve I not<br>to be slain by thee. O king. I will do something that is agreeable to<br>thee. O king of the Nishadhas. I will speak of thee before Damayanti in<br>such a way that she will not ever desire to have any other person (for<br>her lord).' Thus addressed, the king liberated that swan. And those swans<br>then rose on their wings and went to the country of the Vidarbhas. And on<br>arriving at the city of the Vidarbhas the birds alighted before<br>Damayanti, who beheld them all. And Damayanti in the midst of her maids,<br>beholding those birds of extraordinary appearance was filled with<br>delight, and strove without loss of time to catch those coursers of the<br>skies. And the swans at this, before that bevy of beauties, fled in all<br>directions. And those maidens there pursued the birds, each (running)<br>after one. And the swan after which Damayanti ran, having led her to a<br>secluded spot, addressed her in human speech, saying, O Damayanti, there<br>is a king amongst the Nishadhas named Nala. He is equal unto the Aswins<br>in beauty, not having his peer among men. Indeed, in comeliness, he is<br>like Kandarpa himself in his embodied form. O fair-complexioned one, O<br>thou of slender waist, if thou becomest his wife, thy existence and this<br>thy beauty may be of purpose. We have, indeed, beheld celestials and<br>Gandharvas, and Nagas, and Rakshasas, and men, but never saw we before<br>any one like Nala. Thou also art a jewel among thy sex, as Nala is the<br>prime among men. The union of the best with the best is happy.' Thus<br>addressed by the swan. Damayanti, O monarch, replied unto him there,<br>saying, 'Do thou speak thus unto Nala also, 'Saying So be it, to the<br>daughter of Vidarbha, the oviparous one, O king, returned to the country<br>of the Nishadhas, and related everything unto Nala."
