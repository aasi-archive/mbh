                            Bhima said, 'O king, unsubstantial as thou art like froth, unstable like<br>a fruit (falling when ripe), dependent on time, and mortal, having<br>entered into an agreement in respect of time, which is infinite and<br>immeasurable, quick like a shaft or flowing like a stream, and carrying<br>everything before it like death itself, how canst regard it as available<br>by thee? How can he, O son of Kunti, wait whose life is shortened every<br>moment, even like a quantity of collyrium that is lessened each time a<br>grain is taken up by the needle? He only whose life is unlimited or who<br>knoweth with certitude what the period of his life is, and who knoweth<br>the future as if it were before his eyes, can indeed wait for the arrival<br>of (an expected) time. If we wait, O king, for thirteen years, that<br>period, shortening our lives, will bring us nearer to death. Death is<br>sure to overtake every creature having a corporeal existence. Therefore,<br>we should strive for the possession of our kingdom before we die. He that<br>faileth to achieve fame, by failing to chastise his foes, is like an<br>unclean thing. He is a useless burden on the earth like an incapacitated<br>bull and perisheth ingloriously. The man who, destitute of strength, and<br>courage, chastiseth not his foes, liveth in vain, I regard such a one as<br>low-born. Thy hand can rain gold; thy fame spreadeth over the whole<br>earth; slaying thy foes, therefore, in battle, enjoy thou the wealth<br>acquired by the might of thy arms. O repressor of all foes, O king, if a<br>man slaying his injurer, goeth the very day into hell, that hell becometh<br>heaven to him. O king, the pain one feeleth in having to suppress one's<br>wrath is more burning than fire itself. Even now I burn with it and<br>cannot sleep in the day or the night. This son of Pritha, called<br>Vibhatsu, is foremost in drawing the bow-string. He certainly burneth<br>with grief, though he liveth here like a lion in his den. This one that<br>desireth to slay without aid all wielders of the bow on earth, represseth<br>the wrath that riseth in his breast, like a mighty elephant. Nakula,<br>Sahadeva, and old Kunti&#8212;that mother of heroes, are all dumb, desiring to<br>please thee. And all our friends along with the Srinjayas equally desire<br>to please thee. I alone, and Prativindhya's mother speak unto thee<br>burning with grief. Whatever I speak unto thee is agreeable to all of<br>them, for all of them plunged in distress, eagerly wish for battle. Then,<br>O monarch, what more wretched a calamity can overtake us that our kingdom<br>should be wrested from us by weak and contemptible foes and enjoyed by<br>them? O king, from the weakness of thy disposition thou feelest shame in<br>violating thy pledge. But, O slayer of foes, no one applaudeth thee for<br>thus suffering such pain in consequence of the kindliness of thy<br>disposition. Thy intellect, O king, seeth not the truth, like that of a<br>foolish and ignorant person of high birth who hath committed the words of<br>the Vedas to memory without understanding their sense. Thou art kind like<br>a Brahmana. How hast thou been born in the Kshatriya order? They that are<br>born in the Kshatriya order are generally of crooked hearts. Thou hast<br>heard (recited) the duties of kings, as promulgated by Manu, fraught with<br>crookedness and unfairness and precepts opposed to tranquillity and<br>virtue. Why dost thou then, O king, forgive the wicked sons of<br>Dhritarashtra? Thou hast intelligence, prowess, learning and high birth.<br>Why dost thou then, O tiger among men, act in respect of thy duties, like<br>a huge snake that is destitute of motion? O son of Kunti, he that<br>desireth to conceal us, only wisheth to conceal the mountains of Himavat<br>by means of a handful of grass. O son of Pritha, known as thou art over<br>whole earth, thou wilt not be able to live unknown, like the sun that can<br>never course through the sky unknown to men. Like a large tree in a<br>well-watered region with spreading branches and flowers and leaves, or<br>like Indra's elephant, how will Jishnu live unknown? How also will these<br>children, the brothers, Nakula and Sahadeva, equal unto a couple of young<br>lions, both live in secret? How, O son of Pritha, will Krishna&#8212;the<br>daughter of Drupada&#8212;a princess and mother of heroes, of virtuous deeds<br>and known over all the world, live unknown? Me also, everybody knoweth<br>from my boyhood. I do not see how I can live unknown. As well mighty<br>mountains of Meru be sought to be concealed. Then, again, many kings had<br>been expelled by us from their kingdom. These kings and princes will all<br>follow the bad son of Dhritarashtra, for robbed and exiled by us, they<br>have not still become friendly. Desiring to do good unto Dhritarashtra,<br>they will certainly seek to injure us. They will certainly set against us<br>numerous spies in disguise. If these discover us and report their<br>discovery, a great danger will overtake us. We have already lived in the<br>woods full thirteen months. Regard them, O king, for their length as<br>thirteen years. The wise have said that a month is a substitute for a<br>year, like the pot-herb that is regarded as a substitute for the Soma.<br>Or, (if thou breakest thy pledge), O king, thou mayst free thyself from<br>this sin by offering good savoury food to a quiet bull carrying sacred<br>burdens. Therefore, O king resolve thou to slay thy enemies. There is no<br>virtue higher than fighting, for every Kshatriya!"
