                            Yudhishthira said, "Why did that high-souled one give away a drona of<br>corn? And, O eminently pious one, to whom and in what prescribed way did<br>he give it? Do thou tell me this. Surely, I consider the life of that<br>virtuous person as having borne fruit with whose practices the possessor<br>himself of the six attributes, witnessing everything, was well pleased."<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'There lived, O king, in Kurukshetra a virtuous man (sage),<br>Mudgala by name. And he was truthful, and free from malice, and of<br>subdued senses. And he used to lead the Sila and Unchha modes of<br>life.[86] And although living like a pigeon, yet that one of mighty<br>austerities entertained his guests, celebrated the sacrifice called<br>Istikrita, and performed other rites. And that sage together with his son<br>and wife, ate for a fortnight, and during the other fortnight led the<br>life of a pigeon, collecting a drona of corn. And celebrating the Darsa<br>and Paurnamasya sacrifices, that one devoid of guile, used to pass his<br>days by taking the food that remained after the deities and the guests<br>had eaten. And on auspicious lunar days, that lord of the three worlds,<br>Indra himself, accompanied by the celestials used, O mighty monarch, to<br>partake of the food offered at his sacrifice. And that one, having<br>adopted the life of a Muni, with a cheerful heart entertained his guests<br>also with food on such days. And as that high-souled one distributed his<br>food with alacrity, the remainder of the drona of corn increased as soon<br>as a guest appeared. And by virtue of the pure spirit in which the sage<br>gave a way, that food of his increased so much that hundreds upon<br>hundreds of learned Brahmanas were fed with it.<br><br>"And, O king, it came to pass that having heard of the virtuous Mudgala<br>observant of vows, the Muni Durvasa, having space alone for his<br>covering,[87] his accoutrements worn like that of maniac, and his head<br>bare of hair, came there, uttering, O Pandava various insulting words.<br>And having arrived there that best of Munis said unto the Brahmana. 'Know<br>thou, O foremost of Brahmanas, that I have come hither seeking for food.<br>Thereupon Mudgala said unto the sage, 'Thou art welcome!' And then<br>offering to that maniac of an ascetic affected by hunger, water to wash<br>his feet and mouth, that one observant of the vow of feeding guests,<br>respectfully placed before him excellent fare. Affected by hunger, the<br>frantic Rishi completely exhausted the food that had been offered unto<br>him. Thereupon, Mudgala furnished him again with food. Then having eaten<br>up all that food, he besmeared his body with the unclean orts and went<br>away as he had come. In this manner, during the next season, he came<br>again and ate up all the food supplied by that wise one leading the<br>Unchha mode of life. Thereupon, without partaking any food himself, the<br>sage Mudgala again became engaged in collecting corn, following the<br>Unchha mode. Hunger could not disturb his equanimity. Nor could anger,<br>nor guile, nor a sense of degradation, nor agitation, enter into the<br>heart of that best of Brahmanas leading the Unchha mode of life along<br>with his son and his wife. In this way, Durvasa having made up his mind,<br>during successive seasons presented himself for six several times before<br>that best of sages living according to the Unchha mode; yet that Muni<br>could not perceive any agitation in Mudgala's heart; and he found the<br>pure heart of the pure-souled ascetic always pure. Thereupon,<br>well-pleased, the sage addressed Mudgala, saying, There is not another<br>guileless and charitable being like thee on earth. The pangs of hunger<br>drive away to a distance the sense of righteousness and deprive people of<br>all patience. The tongue, loving delicacies, attracteth men towards them.<br>Life is sustained by food. The mind, moreover, is fickle, and it is hard<br>to keep it in subjection. The concentration of the mind and of the senses<br>surely constitutes ascetic austerities. It must be hard to renounce in a<br>pure spirit a thing earned by pains. Yet, O pious one, all this hath been<br>duly achieved by thee. In thy company we feel obliged and gratified.<br>Self-restraint, fortitude, justice, control of the senses and of<br>faculties, mercy, and virtue, all these are established in thee. Thou<br>hast by the deeds conquered the different worlds and have thereby<br>obtained admission into paths of beautitude. Ah! even the dwellers of<br>heaven are proclaiming thy mighty deeds of charity. O thou observant of<br>vows, thou shalt go to heaven even in thine own body.<br><br>"Whilst the Muni Durvasa was speaking thus, a celestial messenger<br>appeared before Mudgala, upon a car yoked with swans and cranes, hung<br>with a neat work of bells, scented with divine fragrance, painted<br>picturesquely, and possessed of the power of going everywhere at will.<br>And he addressed the Brahmana sage, saying, 'O sage, do thou ascend into<br>this chariot earned by thy acts. Thou hast attained the fruit of thy<br>asceticism!'<br><br>"As the messenger of the gods was speaking thus, the sage told him, 'O<br>divine messenger, I desire that thou mayst describe unto me the<br>attributes of those that reside there. What are their austerities, and<br>what their purposes? And, O messenger of the gods, what constitutes<br>happiness in heaven, and what are the disadvantages thereof? It is<br>declared by virtuous men of good lineage that friendship with pious<br>people is contracted by only walking with them seven paces. O lord, in<br>the name of that friendship I ask thee, 'Do thou without hesitation tell<br>me the truth, and that which is good for me now. Having heard thee, I<br>shall, according to thy words, ascertain the course I ought to follow.'"
