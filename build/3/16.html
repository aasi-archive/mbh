                            "Vasudeva continued, 'O king of kings, Salwa, the lord of Saubha, came<br>towards our city with an immense force consisting of infantry, cavalry<br>and elephants! And the army headed by king Salwa, consisting of four<br>kings of forces, occupied a level ground commanding a copious<br>water-supply. And forsaking cemeteries and temples dedicated to the gods,<br>and sacred trees, and grounds covered by ant-hills, that host occupied<br>every other place. And the roads (leading to the city) were blocked up by<br>the divisions of the army, and the secret entrances also were all blocked<br>up by the enemy's camp. And, O Kauravya, like unto the lord of birds<br>(Garuda), the ruler of Saubha rushed towards Dwaraka, bringing with him,<br>O bull among men, his host equipped with all kinds of arms, skilled in<br>all weapons, consisting of a dense display of cars and elephants and<br>cavalry abounding in banners, and well-paid and well-fed foot-soldiers<br>possessed of great strength and bearing every mark of heroism and<br>furnished with wonderful chariots and bows. And beholding the army of<br>Salwa, the youthful princess of the Vrishni race resolved to encounter it<br>sallying out of the city. And, O king, Charudeshna, Samva, and the mighty<br>warrior Pradyumna, O descendant of the Kuru race, sailed out, ascending<br>on their chariots, and clad in mail, and decked with ornaments, with<br>colours flying, resolved to encounter the mighty and countless host of<br>Salwa! And Samva taking up his bows eagerly attacked on the field of<br>battle Kshemavriddhi, the commander of Salwa's forces and his chief<br>counsellor also! And, O thou foremost of Bharatas, the son of Jambavati<br>then began to shower arrows in a continuous stream even as Indra<br>showereth down rain! And, O mighty king, then Kshemavriddhi, the<br>commander of Salwa's forces, bore that shower of arrows, immovable as the<br>Himavat! And, O foremost of kings, Kshemavriddhi on his part, discharged<br>at Samva mightier volley of shafts, aided by his powers of illusion! And<br>dispersing by counter illusion that discharge inspired by illusion, Samva<br>showered on his (adversary's) car a thousand arrows! Then pierced by the<br>shafts on Samva and overwhelmed there with Kshemavriddhi, the commander<br>of the hostile host, left the field by the help of his fleet-steed! And<br>when the wicked general of Salwa had left the field, a mighty Daitya<br>called Vegavat rushed at my son! And, O best of monarchs, thus attacked,<br>the heroic Samva, the perpetuator of the Vrishni race, bore that onset of<br>Vegavat, keeping his ground. And, O son of Kunti, the heroic Samva, of<br>prowess incapable of being baffled, whirling a quickly-going mace, hurled<br>it speedily at Vegavat! And, O king, struck with that mace, Vegavat fell<br>down on the ground, like a weather-beaten and faded lord of the forest of<br>decayed roots! And on that heroic Asura of mighty energy, being slain<br>with the mace, my son entered within that mighty host and began to fight<br>with all. And, O great king, a well-known Danava named Vivindhya, a<br>mighty warrior wielding a large and powerful bow, encountered<br>Charudeshna! And, O monarch, the encounter between Charudeshna and<br>Vivindhya was as fierce as that in days of yore between Vritra and<br>Vasava! And enraged with each other the combatants pierced each other<br>with their arrows, uttering loud roars like unto two powerful lions! Then<br>the son of Rukmini fixed on his bow-string a mighty weapon possessing the<br>splendour of fire or the sun, and capable of destroying all foes, having<br>first vivified it with incantations! Then, O monarch, that mighty warrior<br>my son, fired with wrath, challenged Vivindhya and discharged the weapon<br>at him. And the Danava struck with that weapon, fell down on the ground a<br>lifeless corpse! And beholding Vivindhya slain, and the whole host waver,<br>Salwa advanced again on his beautiful car capable of going everywhere.<br>And, O king of mighty arms, beholding Salwa on that beautiful car of his,<br>the combatants of Dwaraka wavered with fear! But, O thou of the Kuru<br>race, Pradyumna sailed out, and, O great king, bidding the Anarttas be of<br>good cheer, said, 'Waver ye not, and staying behold me fight I Even I<br>shall, by force, repell that car with Salwa on it! Ye Yadavas, this day,<br>I shall, with my weapons like unto serpents discharged from my bow with<br>my hand, destroy this host of the lord of Saubha! Be of good cheer, ye<br>all! Fear not! The lord of Saubha will be slain today! Attached by me,<br>the wretch will meet with destruction together with his car!' O son of<br>Pandu, upon Pradyumna speaking thus with cheerful heart, the Yadava host,<br>O hero, remained on the field, and began to fight cheerfully!'"
