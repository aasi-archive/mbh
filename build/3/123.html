                            "Lomasa said, 'Once on a time, O king, those celestials, namely the twin<br>Aswins, happened to behold Sukanya, when she had (just) bathed, and when<br>her person was bare. And seeing that one of excellent limbs, and like<br>unto the daughter of the lord of celestials, the nose-born Aswins neared<br>her, and addressed her, saying, 'O thou of shapely thighs, whose daughter<br>art thou? And what doest thou in this wood? O auspicious one, O thou of<br>excellent grace, we desire to know this, do thou therefore tell us.'<br>Thereupon she replied bashfully unto those foremost of celestials. 'Know<br>me as Sarayati's daughter, and Chyavana's wife.' Thereat the Aswins again<br>spake unto her, smiling. 'What for, O fortunate one, hath thy father<br>bestowed thee on a person who is verging on death? Surely, O timid girl,<br>thou shinest in this wood like lightning. Not in the regions of the<br>celestials themselves, O girl, have our eyes lighted on thy like. O<br>damsel, unadornedand without gay robes as thou art, thou beautifiest this<br>wood exceedingly. Still, O thou of faultless limbs, thou canst not look<br>so beautiful, when (as at present) thou art soiled with mud and dirt, as<br>thou couldst, if decked with every ornament and wearing gorgeous apparel.<br>Why, O excellent girl in such plight servest thou a decrepit old husband,<br>and one that hath become incapable of realising pleasure and also of<br>maintaining thee, O thou of luminous smiles? O divinely beautiful damsel,<br>do thou, forsaking Chyavana accept one of us for husband. It behoveth<br>thee not to spend thy youth fruitlessly.'"<br><br>"Thus addressed Sukanya answered the celestials saying. 'I am devoted to<br>my husband, Chyavana: do ye not entertain any doubts (regarding my<br>fidelity). Thereupon they again spake unto her, 'We two are the celestial<br>physicians of note. We will make thy lord young and graceful. Do thou<br>then select one of us, viz., ourselves and thy husband,&#8212;for thy partner.<br>Promising this do thou, O auspicious one, bring hither thy husband.' .. O<br>king, agreeably to their words she went to Bhrigu's son and communicated<br>to him what the two celestials had said. Hearing her message, Chyavana<br>said unto his wife, 'Do thou so.' Having received the permission of her<br>lord, (she returned to the celestials) and said, 'Do ye so.' Then hearing<br>her words, viz., 'Do ye so,' they spoke unto the king's daughter. 'Let<br>thy husband enter into water.' Thereat Chyavana desirous of obtaining<br>beauty, quickly entered into water. The twin Aswins also, O king, sank<br>into the sheet of water. And the next moment they all came out of the<br>tank in surpassingly beautiful forms, and young and wearing burnished<br>earrings. And all, possessed of the same appearance pleasing to behold,<br>addressed her saying, 'O fortunate one, do thou choose one of us for<br>spouse. And O beauteous one, do thou select him for lord who may please<br>thy fancy.' Finding, however, all of them of the same appearance she<br>deliberated; and at last ascertaining the identity of her husband, even<br>selected him.<br><br>"Having obtained coveted beauty and also his wife, Chyavana, of exceeding<br>energy, well pleased, spake these words unto the nose-born celestials:<br>'Since at your hands, an old man, I have obtained youth, and beauty, and<br>also this wife of mine, I will, well pleased, make you quaffers of the<br>Soma juice in the presence of the lord of celestials himself. This I tell<br>you truly.' Hearing this, highly delighted, the twins ascendedto heaven;<br>and Chyavana and Sukanya too passed their days happily even like<br>celestials."
