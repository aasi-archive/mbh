                            Satyaki said, "O Rama! this is not the time of lamentation; let us do<br>that which is proper and suited to the present occasion, although<br>Yudhishthira doth not speak a single word. Those who have persons to look<br>after their welfare do not undertake anything of themselves; they have<br>others to do their work, as Saivya and others did for Yayati. Likewise, O<br>Rama! those who have appointed functionaries to undertake their work on<br>their own responsibility, as the leaders of men, they may be said to have<br>real patrons, and they meet with no difficulty, like helpless beings. How<br>is it that when the sons of Pritha have for their patrons these two men,<br>Rama and Krishna, and the two others, Pradyumna and Samva, together with<br>myself,&#8212;these patrons being able to protect all the three worlds,&#8212;how<br>is it that the son of Pritha is living in the wood with his brothers? It<br>is fit that this very day the army of the Dasarhas should march out,<br>variously armed and with checkered mails. Let Dhritarashtra's sons be<br>overwhelmed with the forces of the Vrishinis and let them go with their<br>friends to the abode of the god of death. Let him alone who wields the<br>bow made of the horn (Krishna), thou alone, if roused, wouldst be able to<br>surround even the whole of this earth. I ask thee to kill Dhritarashtra's<br>son with all his men, as the great Indra, the lord of the gods kill<br>Vritra. Arjuna, the son of Pritha, is my brother, and also my friend, and<br>also my preceptor, and is like the second self of Krishna. It is for this<br>that men desire for a worthy son, and that preceptor seeks a pupil who<br>would contradict him not. It is for this that the time is come for that<br>excellent work, which is the best of all tasks and difficult to perform.<br>I shall baffle Duryodhana's volleys of arms by my own excellent weapons.<br>I shall overpower all in the field of battle. I shall in my wrath cut off<br>his head with my excellent shafts, little inferior to snakes and poison<br>and fire. And with the keen edge of my sword, I shall forcibly sever his<br>head from the trunk, in the field of battle; then I shall kill his<br>followers, and Duryodhana, and all of Kuru's race. O son of Rohini! let<br>the followers of Bhima look at me with joy at their heart, when I shall<br>keep up the weapons of war in the field of battle, and when I shall go on<br>slaying all the best fighting men on the side of the Kurus, as at the end<br>of time fire will burn vast heaps of straw. Kripa and Drona and Vikarna<br>and Kama are not able to bear the keen arrows shot by Pradyumna. I know<br>the power of Arjuna's son&#8212;he conducts himself like the son of Krishna in<br>the field of battle. Let Samva chastise by the force of his arms<br>Dussasana; let him destroy by force Dussasana and his charioteer and his<br>car. In the field of battle when the son of Jamvavati becomes<br>irresistible in fight, there is nothing which can withstand his force.<br>The army of the demon Samvara was speedily routed by him when only a boy.<br>By him was killed in fight Asvachakra, whose thighs were round, and whose<br>muscular arms were of exceeding length. Who is there that would be able<br>to go forward to the car of Samva, who is great in fight, when mounted on<br>a car? As a mortal coming under the clutches of death can never escape;<br>so who is there that once coming under his clutches in the field of<br>battle, is able to return with his life? The son of Vasudeva will burn<br>down by the volleys of his fiery shafts all the hostile troops, and those<br>two warriors, Bhishma and Drona,&#8212;who are great on a car, and Somadatta<br>surrounded by all his sons. What is there in all the world including the<br>gods, which Krishna cannot encounter on an equal footing, when he takes<br>up the weapons of war, wields in his hands excellent arrows, arms himself<br>with his dice, and thus becomes unrivalled in fight? Then let Aniruddha<br>also take up in his hand his buckler and sword, and let him cover the<br>surface of the earth with Dhritarashtra's sons, their heads separated<br>from their trunks, their bodies devoid of all consciousness as in a<br>sacrificial rite the altar is overspread with sacred grass placed upon<br>the same. And Gada and Uluka, and Vahuka and Bhanu and Nitha and the<br>young Nishatha valiant in battle and Sarana, and Charudeshna,<br>irresistible in war, let them perform feats befitting their race. Let the<br>united army of the Satwatas and Suras, together with the best soldiers of<br>the Vrishnis, the Bhojas, and the Andhakas, kill those sons of<br>Dhritarashtra in the field of battle and let them swell their expanded<br>fame throughout the world. Then let Abhimanyu rule the world so long as<br>this most excellent of virtuous men, the magnanimous Yudhishthira, may be<br>engaged in fulfilling his vow,&#8212;the vow that was accepted and declared by<br>him, the most righteous of Kuru's race, on the occasion of the famous<br>play at dice. Afterwards the virtuous king will protect the earth, all<br>his foes defeated in battle by shafts which will be discharged by us.<br>Then there will remain no sons of Dhritarashtra on earth,&#8212;nor the son of<br>the charioteer (Kama). This is the most important work for us to do, and<br>this will surely lead to fame."<br><br>"Krishna said, 'O scion of the race of Madhu! no doubt what thou sayest<br>is true; we accept thy words, O thou of courage that is never weak! But<br>this bull of the Kuru race (Yudhishthira) would never accept the<br>sovereignty of the earth, unless it were won by the prowess of his own<br>arms. Neither for the sake of pleasure, nor from fear, nor from<br>covetousness, would Yudhishthira ever renounce the rules of the caste;<br>nor would these two heroes, who are mighty, when mounted on a car&#8212;Bhima<br>and Arjuna; nor the twin brothers, nor Krishna, the daughter of Drupada.<br>He possessing the appetite of a wolf (Bhima), and the winner of riches<br>(Arjuna), are both unrivalled in fight throughout the world. And why<br>should not this king rule over the entire world when he hath the two sons<br>of Madri to espouse his cause? The high-souled ruler of Panchala together<br>with the Kekaya king, and we also should put forth our united strength,<br>and then would the enemies of Yudhisthira be annihilated.'"<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'It is not strange that thou shouldst speak thus, O<br>scion of Madhu's race! but to me truth seems to be the first<br>consideration, above that of my sovereign power itself. But it is Krishna<br>alone who precisely knoweth what I am; and it is I alone who precisely<br>know what Krishna (really) is. O thou endued with valour! O scion of<br>Madhu's race! as soon as he will perceive that the time is come for feats<br>of bravery, then, O most valiant of Sini's race, he also of beautiful<br>hair (Krishna) will defeat Suyodhana. Let the brave men of the Dasarha<br>race go back today. They are my patrons; and the foremost of human<br>beings, they have visited me here. O ye of immeasurable strength! never<br>fall off from the path of virtue. I shall see you again, when ye will be<br>happily gathered together.'<br><br>"Then after mutual greeting and obeisance to seniors, and having embraced<br>the youthful, those valiant men of the Yadu race and the sons of Pandu<br>separated. And the Yadus reunited to their home; and the Pandavas<br>continued their journey to the sacred spots. Then having parted with<br>Krishna, the virtuous king, accompanied by his brothers and servants, and<br>also by Lomasa, went to the sacred river Payosini. Its fine landing place<br>was constructed by the king of Vidarbha. And he began to dwell on the<br>banks of the Payosini, whose waters were mingled with the distilled Soma<br>juice. There the high-souled Yudhishthira was greeted with excellent<br>laudatory, terms by numerous leaders of the twice-born class, who were<br>delighted to see him there."
