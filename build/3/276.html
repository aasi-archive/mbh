                            "Markandeya said, 'Beholding Ravana come, Maricha received him with a<br>respectful welcome, and offered him fruits and roots. And after Ravana<br>had taken his seat, and rested himself a while, Maricha skilled in<br>speech, sat beside Ravana and addressed him who was himself as eloquent<br>in speech, saying, 'Thy complexion hath assumed an unnatural hue; is it<br>all right with thy kingdom, O king of the Rakshasas? What hath brought<br>thee here? Do thy subjects continue to pay thee the same allegiance that<br>they used to pay thee before? What business hath brought thee here? Know<br>that it is already fulfilled, even if it be very difficult of fulfilment!<br>Ravana, whose heart was agitated with wrath and humiliation informed him<br>briefly of the acts of Rama and the measures that were to be taken.' And<br>on hearing his story, Maricha briefly replied to him, saying, 'Thou must<br>not provoke Rama, for I know his strength! Is there a person who is<br>capable of withstanding the impetus of his arrows? That great man hath<br>been the cause of my assuming my present ascetic life. What evil-minded<br>creature hath put thee up to this course calculated to bring ruin and<br>destruction on thee?' To this Ravana indignantly replied, reproaching him<br>thus, 'If thou dost not obey my orders, thou shall surely die at my<br>hands.' Maricha then thought within himself, 'When death is inevitable, I<br>shall do his biddings; for it is better to die at the hands of one that<br>is superior.' Then he replied to the lord of the Rakshasas saying, 'I<br>shall surely render thee whatever help I can!' Then the Ten-headed Ravana<br>said unto him, 'Go and tempt Sita, assuming the shape of a deer with<br>golden horns and a golden skin! When Sita will observe thee thus, she<br>will surely send away Rama to hunt thee. And then Sita will surely come<br>within my power, and I shall forcibly carry her away. And then that<br>wicked Rama will surely die of grief at the loss of his wife. Do thou<br>help me in this way!'<br><br>"Thus addressed, Maricha performed his obsequies (in anticipation) and<br>with a sorrowful heart, followed Ravana who was in advance of him. And<br>having reached the hermitage of Rama of difficult achievements, they both<br>did as arranged beforehand. And Ravana appeared in the guise of an<br>ascetic with head shaven, and adorned with a Kamandala, and a treble<br>staff. And Maricha appeared in the shape of a deer. And Maricha appeared<br>before the princess of Videha in that guise. And impelled by Fate, she<br>sent away Rama after that deer. And Rama, with the object of pleasing<br>her, quickly took up his bow, and leaving Lakshmana behind to protect<br>her, went in pursuit of that deer. And armed with his bow and quiver and<br>scimitar, and his fingers encased in gloves of Guana skin, Rama went in<br>pursuit of that deer, after the manner of Rudra following the stellar<br>deer[90] in days of yore. And that Rakshasa enticed away Rama to a great<br>distance by appearing before him at one time and disappearing from his<br>view at another. And when Rama at last knew who and what that deer was,<br>viz., that he was a Rakshasa, that illustrious descendant of Raghu's race<br>took out an infallible arrow and slew that Rakshasa, in the disguise of a<br>deer. And struck with Rama's arrow, the Rakshasa, imitating Rama's voice,<br>cried out in great distress, calling upon Sita and Lakshmana. And when<br>the princess of Videha heard that cry of distress, she urged Lakshmana to<br>run towards the quarter from whence the cry came. Then Lakshmana said to<br>her, "Timid lady, thou hast no cause of fear! Who is so powerful as to be<br>able to smite Rama? O thou of sweet smiles, in a moment thou wilt behold<br>thy husband Rama!' Thus addressed, the chaste Sita, from that timidity<br>which is natural to women, became suspicious of even the pure Lakshmana,<br>and began to weep aloud. And that chaste lady, devoted to her husband,<br>harshly reproved Lakshmana, saying, 'The object which thou, O fool,<br>cherishest in thy heart, shall never be fulfilled! I would rather kill<br>myself with a weapon or throw myself from the top of a hill or enter into<br>a blazing fire than live with a sorry wretch like thee, forsaking my<br>husband Rama, like a tigress under the protection of a jackal!&#8212;<br><br>When the good natured Lakshmana, who was very fond of his brother, heard<br>these words, he shut his ears (with his hands) and set out on the track<br>that Rama had taken. And Lakshmana set out without casting a single<br>glance on that lady with lips soft and red like the Bimba fruit.<br>Meanwhile, the Rakshasa Ravana, wearing a genteel guise though wicked at<br>heart, and like unto fire enveloped in a heap of ashes, showed himself<br>there. And he appeared there in the disguise of a hermit, for forcibly<br>carrying away that lady of blameless character. The virtuous daughter of<br>Janaka, seeing him come, welcomed him with fruits and root and a seat.<br>Disregarding these and assuming his own proper shape, that bull among<br>Rakshasas began to re-assure the princess of Videha in these words, 'I<br>am, O Sita, the king of the Rakshasas, known by the name of Ravana! My<br>delightful city, known by the name of Lanka is on the other side of the<br>great ocean! There among beautiful women, thou wilt shine with me! O lady<br>of beautiful lips, forsaking the ascetic Rama do thou become my wife!'<br>Janaka's daughter of beautiful lips, hearing these and other words in the<br>same strain, shut her ears and replied unto him, saying, 'Do not say so!<br>The vault of heaven with all its stars may fall down, the Earth itself<br>may be broken into fragments, fire itself may change its nature by<br>becoming cool, yet I cannot forsake the descendant of Raghu! How can a<br>she-elephant, who hath lived with the mighty leader of a herd with rent<br>temples forsake him and live with a hog? Having once tasted the sweet<br>wine prepared from honey or flowers, how can a woman, I fancy, relish the<br>wretched arrak from rice?' Having uttered those words, she entered the<br>cottage, her lips trembling in wrath and her arms moving to and fro in<br>emotion. Ravana, however, followed her thither and intercepted her<br>further progress. And rudely scolded by the Rakshasa, she swooned away.<br>But Ravana seized her by the hair of her head, and rose up into the air.<br>Then a huge vulture of the name of Jatayu living on a mountain peak,<br>beheld that helpless lady thus weeping and calling upon Rama in great<br>distress while being carried away by Ravana."
