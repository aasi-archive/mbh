                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'O Muni of profound wisdom, it is even as thou<br>sayest! I know it well as do all these kings! Indeed, what thou<br>considerest to be beneficial for the Kurus was pointed out to me, O Muni,<br>by Vidura and Bhishma and Drona. And, if I deserve thy favour, and if<br>thou hast kindness for the Kurus, do thou exhort my wicked son<br>Duryodhana!'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'O king, after having seen the Pandava brothers, here cometh<br>the holy Rishi Maitreya, with the desire of seeing us. That mighty Rishi,<br>O king, will admonish thy son for the welfare of this race. And, O<br>Kauravya, what he adviseth must be followed undoubtingly, for if what he<br>recommendeth is not done, the sage will curse thy son in anger.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Saying this, Vyasa departed, and Maitreya made<br>his appearance. And the king with his son respectfully received that<br>way-worn chief of Munis, with offerings of the Arghya and other rites.<br>And king Dhritarashtra, the son of Amvika, in words of respect thus<br>addressed the sage, 'O holy one, hath journey from the Kuru-jangala been<br>a pleasant one? Are those heroes, the five Pandavas living happily? Do<br>those bulls of the Kuru race intend to stay out their time? Will the<br>brotherly affection of the Kauravas ever be impaired?'<br><br>"Maitreya said, 'Setting out on a pilgrimage to the different shrines, I<br>arrived at Kuru-jangala, and there I unexpectedly saw Yudhishthira the<br>just in the woods of Kamyaka. And, O exalted one, many Munis had come<br>there to behold the high-souled Yudhishthira, dwelling in an ascetic<br>asylum, clad in deer-skin and wearing matted locks. It was there, O king<br>of kings, that I heard of the grave error committed by thy sons and the<br>calamity and terrible danger arisen from dice that had overtaken them.<br>Therefore, it is that I have come to thee, for the good of the Kauravas,<br>since, O exalted one, my affection is great for thee and I am delighted<br>with thee! O king, it is not fit that thy sons should on any account<br>quarrel with one another, thyself and Bhishma living. Thou art, O king,<br>the stake at which bulls are tied (in treading cord), and thou art<br>competent to punish and reward! Why dost thou overlook then this great<br>evil that is about to overtake all? And, O descendant of the Kurus, for<br>those wrongs that have been perpetrated in thy court, which are even like<br>the acts of wretched outcasts, thou art not well-thought amongst the<br>ascetics!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then turning to the wrathful prince Duryodhana,<br>the illustrious Rishi Maitreya addressed him in these soft words, 'O<br>mighty-armed Duryodhana, O best of all eloquent men, O illustrious one,<br>give heed unto the words I utter for my good! O king, seek not to quarrel<br>with the Pandavas! And, O bull among men, compass thou thy own good as<br>also of the Pandavas, of the Kurus and of the world! All those tigers<br>among men are heroes of high prowess in war, gifted with the strength of<br>ten thousand elephants, with bodies hard as the thunderbolt, holding fast<br>by their promises, and proud of their manliness! they have slain the<br>enemies of the celestials&#8212;those Rakshasas capable of assuming any form<br>at will, such as were headed by Hidimva and Kirmira! When those<br>high-souled ones went from hence that Rakshasa of fierce soul obstructed<br>their nocturnal path even like an immoveable hill. And even as a tiger<br>slayeth a little deer, Bhima, that foremost of all endued with strength,<br>and ever delighted in fight, slew that monster. Consider also, O king,<br>how while out on his campaign of conquest, Bhima slew in battle that<br>mighty warrior, Jarasandha, possessing the strength of ten thousand<br>elephants. Related to Vasudeva and having the sons of king Drupada as<br>their brothers-in-law, who that is subject to decrepitude and death would<br>undertake to cope with them in battle? O bull of the Bharata race, let<br>there be peace between thee and Pandavas! Follow thou my counsels and<br>surrender not thyself to anger!<br><br>'O king, thus admonished by Maitreya, Duryodhana began to slap his thigh<br>resembling the trunk of the elephant, and smilingly began to scratch the<br>ground with his foot. And the wicked wretch spake not a word, but hung<br>down his head. And, O monarch, beholding Duryodhana thus offer him a<br>slight by scratching the earth silently, Maitreya became angry. And, as<br>if commissioned by fate, Maitreya, the best of Munis, overwhelmed by<br>wrath, set his mind upon cursing Duryodhana! And then, with eyes red in<br>anger, Maitreya, touching water, caused the evil-minded son of<br>Dhritarashtra, saying, 'Since, slighting me thou declinest to act<br>according to my words, thou shalt speedily reap the fruit of this thy<br>insolence! In the great war which shall spring out of the wrongs<br>perpetrated by thee, the mighty Bhima shall smash that thigh of thine<br>with a stroke of his mace!<br><br>'When the Muni had spoken so, king Dhritarashtra began to pacify the<br>sage, in order that what he had said might not happen. But Maitreya said,<br>'O king, if thy son concludeth peace with the Pandavas, this curse of<br>mine, O child, will not take effect, otherwise it must be as I have said!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Desirous of ascertaining the might of Bhima, that<br>foremost of kings, the father of Duryodhana, then asked Maitreya, saying,<br>'How was Kirmira slain by Bhima?'<br><br>"Maitreya said, 'I shall not speak again unto thee, O king, for my words<br>are not regarded by thy son. After I have gone away, Vidura will relate<br>everything unto thee!' And saying this, Maitreya went away to the place<br>whence he had come. And Duryodhana also went out perturbed at the tidings<br>of Kirmira's death (at the hand of Bhima).'"
