                            Vaishampayana said: "That scorcher of foes, Vibhatsu, thus addressed by<br>his maternal uncle, replied, with great cheerlessness of heart, unto<br>Vasudeva who was equally cheerless, saying, O uncle, I am unable to look<br>at this Earth when she is reft of that hero of Vrishnis race and those my<br>other kinsmen. The king and Bhimasena and Sahadeva and Nakula and<br>Yajnaseni, numbering the sixth, are of the same mind with myself in this<br>matter. The time has come for the departure of the king also. Know this,<br>that the hour of our departure too is at hand. Thou art the foremost of<br>those that are well conversant with the course of time. I shall, however,<br>O chastiser of foes, first remove to Indraprastha the women of the<br>Vrishni race as also the children and the aged. Having said so unto his<br>uncle, Arjuna next addressed Daruka, saying, I wish to see without any<br>delay the chief officers of the Vrishni heroes. Having uttered these<br>words, the heroic Arjuna, grieving for those great car-warriors (who had<br>been slain), entered the great hall of the Yadavas (where they used to<br>hold their court), called Sudharma. When he had taken his seat there, all<br>the citizens, including the Brahmanas, and all the ministers of state<br>came and stood surrounding him. Then Partha, more grieved than they,<br>addressed those grieving and cheerless citizens and officers who were<br>more dead than alive, and said these words that were well suited to the<br>occasion: I shall take away with me the remnants of the Vrishnis and the<br>Andhakas. The sea will soon engulf this city. Equip all your cars and<br>place on them all your wealth. This Vajra (the grandson of Krishna) will<br>be your king at Shakraprastha. On the seventh day from this, at sunrise,<br>we shall set out. Make your preparations without delay.<br><br>"Thus addressed by Prithas son of pure deeds, all of them hastened their<br>preparations with eagerness for achieving their safety. Arjuna passed<br>that night in the mansion of Keshava. He was suddenly overwhelmed with<br>great grief and stupefaction. When morning dawned, Vasudeva of great<br>energy and prowess attained, through the aid of Yoga, to the highest<br>goal. A loud and heart-rending sound of wailing was heard in Vasudevas<br>mansion, uttered by the weeping ladies. They were seen with dishevelled<br>hair and divested of ornaments and floral wreaths. Beating their breasts<br>with their hands, they indulged in heart-rending lamentations. Those<br>foremost of women, Devaki and Bhadra and Rohini and Madira threw<br>themselves on the bodies of their lord. Then Partha caused the body of<br>his uncle to be carried out on a costly vehicle borne on the shoulders of<br>men. It was followed by all the citizens of Dwaraka and the people of the<br>provinces, all of whom, deeply afflicted by grief, had been well-affected<br>towards the deceased hero. Before that vehicle were borne the umbrella<br>which had been held over his head at the conclusion of the<br>horse-sacrifice he had achieved while living, and also the blazing fires<br>he had daily worshipped, with the priests that had used to attend to<br>them. The body of the hero was followed by his wives decked in ornaments<br>and surrounded by thousands of women and thousands of their<br>daughters-in-law. The last rites were then performed at that spot which<br>had been agreeable to him while he was alive. The four wives of that<br>heroic son of Sura ascended the funeral pyre and were consumed with the<br>body of their lord. All of them attained to those regions of felicity<br>which were his. The son of Pandu burnt the body of his uncle together<br>with those four wives of his, using diverse kinds of scents and perfumed<br>wood. As the funeral pyre blazed up, a loud sound was heard of the<br>burning wood and other combustible materials, along with the clear chant<br>of Samans and the wailing of the citizens and others who witnessed the<br>rite. After it was all over, the boys of the Vrishni and Andhaka races,<br>headed by Vajra, as also the ladies, offered oblations of water to the<br>high-souled hero.<br><br>"Phalguna, who was careful in observing every duty, having caused this<br>duty to be performed, proceeded, O chief of Bharatas race, next to the<br>place where the Vrishnis were slaughtered. The Kuru prince, beholding<br>them lying slaughtered all around, became exceedingly cheerless. He,<br>however, did what was required to be done in view of that which had<br>happened. The last rites were performed, according to the order of<br>seniority, unto the bodies of those heroes slain by the iron bolts born,<br>by virtue of the curse denounced by the Brahmanas, of the blades of Eraka<br>grass. Searching out the bodies then of Rama and Vasudeva, Arjuna caused<br>them to be burnt by persons skilled in that act. The son of Pandu, having<br>next performed duly those sraddha rites that are done to the dead,<br>quickly set out on the seventh day, mounting on his car. The widows of<br>the Vrishni heroes, wailing aloud, followed the high-souled son of Pandu.<br>Dhananjaya, on cars drawn by bullocks and mules and camels. All were in<br>deep affliction. The servants of the Vrishnis, their horsemen, and their<br>car-warriors too, followed the procession. The citizens and the<br>inhabitants of the country, at the command of Prithas son, set out at the<br>same time and proceeded, surrounding that cavalcade destitute of heroes<br>and numbering only women and the aged and the children. The warriors who<br>fought from the backs of elephants proceeded on elephants as huge as<br>hills. The foot-soldiers also set out, together with the reserves. The<br>children of the Andhaka and the Vrishni races, all followed Arjuna. The<br>Brahmanas and Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas, and wealthy Sudras, set out,<br>keeping before them the 16,000 women that had formed Vasudevas harem, and<br>Vajra, the grandson of the intelligent Krishna. The widows of the other<br>heroes of the Bhoja, the Vrishni, and the Andhaka races, lordless now,<br>that set out with Arjuna, numbered many millions. That foremost of<br>car-warriors, that conqueror of hostile towns, the son of Pritha,<br>escorted this vast procession of Vrishnis, which still abounded with<br>wealth, and which looked like a veritable ocean.<br><br>"After all the people had set out, the ocean, that home of sharks and<br>alligators, flooded Dvaraka, which still teemed with wealth of every<br>kind, with its waters. Whatever portion of the ground was passed over,<br>ocean immediately flooded over with his waters. Beholding this wonderful<br>sight, the inhabitants of Dvaraka walked faster and faster, saying,<br>Wonderful is the course of fate! Dhananjaya, after abandoning Dvaraka,<br>proceeded by slow marches, causing the Vrishni women to rest in pleasant<br>forests and mountains and by the sides of delightful streams. Arrived at<br>the country of the five waters, the puissant Dhananjaya planted a rich<br>encampment in the midst of a land that abounded with corn and kine and<br>other animals. Beholding those lordless widows escorted by Prithas son<br>alone O Bharata, the robbers felt a great temptation (for plunder). Then<br>those sinful wretches, with hearts overwhelmed by cupidity, those Abhiras<br>of ill omen, assembled together and held a consultation. They said, Here<br>there is only one bowman, Arjuna. The cavalcade consists of children and<br>the old. He escorts them, transgressing us. The warriors (of the<br>Vrishnis) are without energy. Then those robbers, numbering by thousands,<br>and armed with clubs, rushed towards the procession of the Vrishnis,<br>desirous of plunder. Urged by the perverse course of time they fell upon<br>that vast concourse, frightening it with loud leonine shouts and desirous<br>of slaughter. The son of Kunti, suddenly ceasing to advance along the<br>path, turned, with his followers, towards the place where the robbers had<br>attacked the procession. Smiling the while, that mighty-armed warrior<br>addressed the assailants, saying, You sinful wretches, forbear, if ye<br>love your lives. Ye will rue this when I pierce your bodies with my<br>shafts and take your lives. Though thus addressed by that hero, they<br>disregarded his words, and though repeatedly dissuaded, they fell upon<br>Arjuna. Then Arjuna endeavoured to string his large, indestructible,<br>celestial bow with some effort. He succeeded with great difficulty in<br>stringing it, when the battle had become furious. He then began to think<br>of his celestial weapons but they would not come to his mind. Beholding<br>that furious battle, the loss of the might of his arm, and the<br>non-appearance of his celestial weapons, Arjuna became greatly ashamed.<br>The Vrishni warriors including the foot-soldiers, the elephant-warriors,<br>and the car-men, failed to rescue those Vrishni women that were being<br>snatched away by the robbers. The concourse was very large. The robbers<br>assailed it at different points. Arjuna tried his best to protect it, but<br>could not succeed. In the very sightof all the warriors, many foremost of<br>ladies were dragged away, while others went away with the robbers of<br>their own accord. The puissant Arjuna, supported by the servants of the<br>Vrishnis, struck the robbers with shafts sped from Gandiva. Soon,<br>however. O king, his shafts were exhausted. In former days his shafts had<br>been inexhaustible. Now, however, they proved otherwise. Finding his<br>shafts exhausted, he became deeply afflicted with grief. The son of Indra<br>then began to strike the robbers with the horns of his bow. Those<br>Mlecchas, however, O Janamejaya, in the very sight of Partha, retreated,<br>taking away with them many foremost ladies of the Vrishnis and Andhakas.<br>The puissant Dhananjaya regarded it all as the work of destiny. Filled<br>with sorrow he breathed heavy sighs at the thought of the non-appearance<br>of his (celestial) weapons, the loss of the might of his arms, the<br>refusal of his bow to obey him, and the exhaustion of his shafts.<br>Regarding it all as the work of destiny, he became exceedingly cheerless.<br>He then ceased, O king, to make further efforts, saying, he had not the<br>power which he had before. The high-souled one, taking with him the<br>remnant of the Vrishni women, and the wealth that was still with them,<br>reached Kurukshetra. Thus bringing with him the remnant of the Vrishnis.<br>he established them at different places. He established the son of<br>Kritavarma at the city called Marttikavat, with the remnant of the women<br>of the Bhoja king. Escorting the remainder, with children and old men and<br>women, the son of Pandu established them, who were reft of heroes, in the<br>city of Indraprastha. The dear son of Yuyudhana, with a company of old<br>men and children and women, the righteous-souled Arjuna established on<br>the banks of the Sarasvati. The rule of Indraprastha was given to Vajra.<br>The widows of Akrura then desired to retire into the woods. Vajra asked<br>them repeatedly to desist, but they did not listen to him. Rukmini, the<br>princess of Gandhara, Saivya, Haimavati, and queen Jamvabati ascended the<br>funeral pyre. Satyabhama and other dear wives of Krishna entered the<br>woods, O king, resolved to set themselves to the practice of penances.<br>They began to live on fruits and roots and pass their time in the<br>contemplation of Hari. Going beyond the Himavat, they took up their abode<br>in a place called Kalpa. Those men who had followed Arjuna from<br>Dwaravati, were distributed into groups, and bestowed upon Vajra. Having<br>done all these acts suited to the occasion, Arjuna, with eyes bathed in<br>tears, then entered the retreat of Vyasa. There he beheld the Island-born<br>Rishi seated at his ease."
