                            Vaishampayana said: "Then Daruka and Keshava and Vabhru left that spot,<br>following in the wake of Rama (for discovering his retreat). They beheld<br>that hero of infinite energy sitting thoughtfully, reclining his back<br>against a tree, in a solitary spot of earth. Finding Rama of great soul,<br>Krishna commanded Daruka, saying, Going to the Kurus, inform Partha of<br>this great slaughter of the Yadus. Let Arjuna come here quickly, hearing<br>of the destruction of the Yadavas through the Brahmanas curse.<br><br>"Thus addressed, Daruka, deprived of his senses by grief, proceeded on a<br>car to the (capital of the) Kurus. After Daruka had gone away, Keshava,<br>seeing Vabhru waiting on him, told him these words: Do thou go quickly<br>for protecting the ladies. Let not robbers do them any injury, tempted by<br>the wealth (that is with them). Thus commanded by Keshava, Vabhru, still<br>helpless with wine but cheerless at the slaughter of his kinsmen,<br>departed. He had rested for a while by the side of Keshava, but as soon<br>as he had proceeded to a distance, the iron-bolt, attaching itself to a<br>mallet in the hands of a hunter, suddenly sprang of itself upon that<br>solitary survivor of the Yadava race and slew him, who also had been<br>included in the curse of the Brahmanas. Beholding Vabhru slain, Keshava<br>of great energy addressed his elder brother and said, Do thou, O Rama<br>wait for me here till I place the ladies under the care of kinsmen.<br><br>"Entering the city of Dwaravati, Janardana said these words unto his<br>father, Do thou protect all the ladies of our house, till Dhananjaya<br>comes. At the skirts of the forest Rama is waiting for me. I shall meet<br>him today. This great carnage of the Yadus has been beheld by me even as<br>I beheld before the carnage of those Kshatriyas who were the foremost<br>ones of Kurus race. It is impossible for me to see this city of the<br>Yadavas without the Yadus beside me. Know that proceeding to the woods I<br>shall practise penances with Rama in my company. Having said these words,<br>Krishna touched the feet of his father with his head, and quickly left<br>his presence. Then a loud wail of sorrow arose from the ladies and<br>children of his house. Hearing that loud sound of wailing uttered by the<br>weeping ladies, Keshava retraced his foot-steps and said unto them,<br>Arjuna will come here. That foremost of man will relieve you of your<br>grief.<br><br>"Proceeding then to the forest, Keshava beheld Rama sitting in a solitary<br>spot thereof. He also saw that Rama had set himself to Yoga and that from<br>out his mouth was issuing a mighty snake. The colour of that snake was<br>white. Leaving the human body (in which he had dwelt so long), that<br>high-souled naga of a 1,000 heads and having a form as large as that of a<br>mountain, endued besides with red eyes, proceeded along that way which<br>led to the ocean. Ocean himself, and many celestial snakes, and many<br>sacred Rivers were there, for receiving him with honour. There were<br>Karkotaka and Vasuki and Takshaka and Prithusravas and Varuna and<br>Kunjara, and Misri and Sankha and Kumuda and Pundarika, and the<br>high-souled Dhritarashtra, and Hrada and Kratha and Sitikantha of fierce<br>energy, and Chakramanda and Atishanda, and that foremost of Nagas called<br>Durmukha, and Amvarisha, and king Varuna himself, O monarch. Advancing<br>forward and offering him the Arghya and water to wash his feet, and with<br>diverse other rites, they all worshipped the mighty Naga and saluted him<br>by making the usual enquiries.<br><br>"After his brother had thus departed from the (human) world, Vasudeva of<br>celestial vision, who was fully acquainted with the end of all things,<br>wandered for some time in that lonely forest thoughtfully. Endued with<br>great energy he then sat down on the bare earth. He had thought before<br>this of everything that had been fore-shadowed by the words uttered by<br>Gandhari in former days. He also recollected the words that Durvasas had<br>spoken at the time his body was smeared by that Rishi with the remnant of<br>the Payasa he had eaten (while a guest at Krishnas house). The<br>high-souled one, thinking of the destruction of the Vrishnis and the<br>Andhakas, as also of the previous slaughter of the Kurus, concluded that<br>the hour (for his own departure from the world) had come. He then<br>restrained his senses (in Yoga). Conversant with the truth of every<br>topic, Vasudeva, though he was the Supreme Deity, wished to die, for<br>dispelling all doubts and establishing a certainty of results (in the<br>matter of human existence), simply for upholding the three worlds and for<br>making the words of Atris son true. Having restrained all his senses,<br>speech, and mind, Krishna laid himself down in high Yoga.<br><br>"A fierce hunter of the name of Jara then came there, desirous of deer.<br>The hunter, mistaking Keshava, who was stretched on the earth in high<br>Yoga, for a deer, pierced him at the heel with a shaft and quickly came<br>to that spot for capturing his prey. Coming up, Jara beheld a man dressed<br>in yellow robes, rapt in Yoga and endued with many arms. Regarding<br>himself an offender, and filled with fear, he touched the feet of<br>Keshava. The high-souled one comforted him and then ascended upwards,<br>filling the entire welkin with splendour. When he reached Heaven, Vasava<br>and the twin Ashvinis and Rudra and the Adityas and the Vasus and the<br>Viswedevas, and Munis and Siddhas and many foremost ones among the<br>Gandharvas, with the Apsaras, advanced to receive him. Then, O king, the<br>illustrious Narayana of fierce energy, the Creator and Destroyer of all,<br>that preceptor of Yoga, filling Heaven with his splendour, reached his<br>own inconceivable region. Krishna then met the deities and (celestial)<br>Rishis and Charanas, O king, and the foremost ones among the Gandharvas<br>and many beautiful Apsaras and Siddhas and Saddhyas. All of them, bending<br>in humility, worshipped him. The deities all saluted him, O monarch, and<br>many foremost of Munis and Rishis worshipped him who was the Lord of all.<br>The Gandharvas waited on him, hymning his praises, and Indra also<br>joyfully praised him."
