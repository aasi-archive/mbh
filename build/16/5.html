                            Vaishampayana said: "Meanwhile Daruka, going to the Kurus and seeing<br>those mighty car-warriors, the son of Pritha, informed them of how the<br>Vrishnis had slain one another with iron bolts. Hearing that the Vrishnis<br>along with the Bhojas and Andhakas and Kukuras had all been slain, the<br>Pandavas, burning with grief, became highly agitated. Then Arjuna, the<br>dear friend of Keshava, bidding them farewell, set out for seeing his<br>maternal uncle. He said that destruction would soon overtake everything.<br>Proceeding to the city of the Vrishnis with Daruka in his company, O<br>puissant king, that hero beheld that the city of Dwaraka looked like a<br>woman bereft of her husband. Those ladies who had, before this, the very<br>Lord of the universe for their protector, were now lordless. Seeing that<br>Partha had come for protecting them, they all set up a loud wail. 16,000<br>ladies had been wedded to Vasudeva. Indeed, as soon as they saw Arjuna<br>arrive, they uttered a loud cry of sorrow. As soon as the Kuru prince met<br>those beauteous ones deprived of the protection of Krishna and of their<br>sons as well, he was unable to look at them, his vision being obstructed<br>by tears. The Dwaraka river had the Vrishnis and the Andhakas for its<br>water, steeds for its fishes, cars for its rafts, the sound of musical<br>instruments and the rattle of cars for its waves, houses and mansions and<br>public squares for its lakes. Gems and precious stones were its abundant<br>moss. The walls of adamant were the garlands of flowers that floated on<br>it. The streets and roads were the strong currents running in eddies<br>along its surface. The great open squares were the still large lakes in<br>its course. Rama and Krishna were its two mighty alligators. That<br>agreeable river now seemed to Arjuna to be the fierce Vaitarani bound up<br>with Times net. Indeed, the son of Vasava, endued with great<br>intelligence, beheld the city to look even thus, reft as it was of the<br>Vrishni heroes. Shorn of beauty, and perfectly cheerless, it presented<br>the aspect of a lotus flower in the season of winter. Beholding the sight<br>that Dwaraka presented, and seeing the numerous wives of Krishna, Arjuna<br>wailed aloud with eyes bathed in tears and fell down on the earth. Then<br>Satya, the daughter of Satrajit, and Rukmini too, O king, fell down<br>beside Dhananjaya and uttered loud wails of grief. Raising him then they<br>caused him to be seated on a golden seat. The ladies sat around that<br>high-souled one, giving expression to their feelings. Praising Govinda<br>and talking with the ladies, the son of Pandu comforted them and then<br>proceeded to see his maternal uncle."
