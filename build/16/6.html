                            Vaishampayana said: "The Kuru prince beheld the heroic and high-souled<br>Anakadundubhi lying on the ground and burning with grief on account of<br>his sons. The broad-chested and mighty-armed son of Pritha, more<br>afflicted than his uncle, with eyes bathed in tears, touched his uncles<br>feet, O Bharata. The mighty-armed Anakadundubhi wished to smell the head<br>of his sisters son but failed to do it, O slayer of foes. The old man of<br>mighty arms, deeply afflicted, embraced Partha with his arms and wept<br>aloud, remembering his sons, brothers, grandsons, daughters sons, and<br>friends.<br><br>"Vasudeva said, Without beholding those heroes, O Arjuna, who had<br>subjugated all the kings of the Earth and the Daityas a hundred times, I<br>am still alive! Methinks, I have no death! Through the fault of those two<br>heroes who were thy dear disciples and who were much regarded by thee,<br>also, O Partha, the Vrishnis have been destroyed. Those two who were<br>regarded as Atirathas amongst the foremost of the Vrishnis, and referring<br>to whom in course of conversation thou wert wont to indulge in pride, and<br>who, O chief of Kurus race, were ever dear to Krishna himselfalas, those<br>two, O Dhananjaya, have been the chief causes of the destruction of the<br>Vrishnis! I do not censure the son of Sini or the son of Hridika, O<br>Arjuna. I do not censure Akrura or the son of Rukmini. No doubt, the<br>curse (of the Rishis) is the sole cause. How is it that that lord of the<br>universe, the slayer of Madhu, who had put forth his prowess for<br>achieving the destruction of Kesin and Kansa, and Chaidya swelling with<br>pride, and Ekalavya, the son of the ruler of the Nishadas, and the<br>Kalingas and the Magadhas, and the Gandharas and the king of Kasi, and<br>many rulers assembled together in the midst of the desert, many heroes<br>belonging to the East and the South, and many kings of the mountainous<br>regionsalas, how could he remain indifferent to such a calamity as the<br>curse denounced by the Rishis? Thyself, Narada, and the Munis, knew him<br>to be the eternal and sinless Govinda, the Deity of unfading glory. Alas,<br>being puissant Vishnu himself, he witnessed, without interfering, the<br>destruction of his kinsmen! My son must have himself allowed all this to<br>happen. He was the Lord of the universe. He did not, however, wish to<br>falsify the words of Gandhari and the Rishis, O scorcher of foes. In thy<br>very sight, O hero, thy grandson, who had been slain by Ashvatthama, was<br>revived through his energy. That friend, however, of yours did not wish<br>to protect his kinsmen. Beholding his sons and grandsons and brothers and<br>friends lying dead, he said unto me these words, O chief of Bharatas<br>race, "The destruction of this our race has at last come. Vibhatsu will<br>come to this city, Dwaravati. Tell him what has occurred, this great<br>carnage of the Vrishnis. I have no doubt that as soon as he will hear of<br>the destruction of the Yadus, that hero of mighty energy will come here<br>without any loss of time. Know, O father, that I am Arjuna and Arjuna is<br>myself. That should be done by thee which he would say. The son of Pandu<br>will do what is best for the women and the children. Even he will perform<br>thy funeral rites. This city of Dwaravati, after Arjunas departure, will,<br>with its walls and edifices, be swallowed up by the ocean without any<br>delay. As regards myself, retiring to some sacred place, I shall bide my<br>hour, with the intelligent Rama in my company, observing strict vows all<br>the while." Having said these words unto me, Hrishikesa of inconceivable<br>prowess, leaving me with the children, has gone away to some spot which I<br>do not know. Thinking of those two high-souled brothers of thine, as also<br>of the terrible carnage of my kinsmen, I have abstained from all food,<br>and am emaciated with grief. I shall neither eat, nor live. By good luck<br>thou meetest me, O son of Pandu. Do thou accomplish all, O Partha, that<br>Krishna has said. This kingdom, with all these women, and all the wealth<br>here, is thine now, O son of Pritha. As regards myself, O slayer of foes,<br>I shall cast off my life-breaths dear though they be."
