                            Vaishampayana said: "At that time the Vrishni ladies dreamed every night<br>that a woman of black complexion and white teeth, entering their abodes,<br>laughed aloud and ran through Dvaraka, snatching from them the auspicious<br>threads in their wrists. The men dreamt that terrible vultures, entering<br>their houses and fire-chambers, gorged themselves on their bodies. Their<br>ornaments and umbrellas and standards and armour were seen to be taken<br>away by terrible Rakshasas. In the very sight of the Vrishnis, the discus<br>of Krishna, given by Agni, made of iron and having its nave composed of<br>hardest adamant, ascended into the firmament. In the very sight of<br>Daruka, the excellent car of Vasudeva, of solar effulgence, and properly<br>equipped, was taken away by the horses yoked unto it. Those foremost of<br>steeds, numbering four, (Saivya, Sugriva, Meghapushpa and Valahaka), and<br>endued with the speed of thought, fled away, dragging the car after them<br>along the surface of the ocean. The two great standards of Krishnas car<br>and Valadevas car, that with the device of Garuda and that bearing the<br>device of the palmyra, which were reverently worshipped by those two<br>heroes, were taken away by Apsaras who, day and night, called upon the<br>Vrishnis and the Andhakas to set out on a pilgrimage to some sacred<br>water. When these omens were seen and heard, those foremost of men, the<br>mighty car-warriors of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas, became desirous of<br>setting out, with their whole families, on a pilgrimage to some sacred<br>water. They prepared diverse kinds of viands and edibles and diverse<br>kinds of wines and meat. The troops of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas,<br>blazing with beauty and endued with fierce energy, then set out from the<br>city on cars and steeds and elephants. The Yadavas, then, with their<br>wives, proceeded to Prabhasa and took up their residence there, each in<br>the (temporary) habitation that was assigned to him, and all having an<br>abundance of provisions consisting of edibles and drink.<br><br>"Hearing that they had taken up their abode on the sea-coast, Uddhava,<br>the wisest of men, who was, besides, well-versed in Yoga, proceeded there<br>and took his leave (for departing). Krishna, with joined hands, saluted<br>Uddhava, and seeing him bent on departing (from the world) and knowing<br>that the destructions of the Vrishnis was at hand, did not feel any<br>disposition to prevent him. The mighty car-warriors among the Vrishnis<br>and the Andhakas, whose hour had come, then saw Uddhava proceed on his<br>great journey, filling the whole welkin with his splendour. The Vrishnis,<br>mixing with wine the food that had been cooked for high-souled Brahmanas,<br>gave it away unto monkeys and apes. Those heroes of fierce energy then<br>began their high revels, of which drinking formed the chief feature, at<br>Prabhasa. The entire field echoed with the blare of hundreds of trumpets<br>and abounded with actors and dancers plying their vocations. In the very<br>sight of Krishna, Rama began to drink, with Kritavarma, Yuyudhana and<br>Gada; and Vabhru also did the same. Then Yuyudhana, inebriated with wine,<br>derisively laughing at and insulting Kritavarma in the midst of that<br>assembly, said, What Kshatriya is there who, armed with weapons, will<br>slay men locked in the embraces of sleep and, therefore, already dead?<br>Hence, O son of Hridika, the Yadavas will never tolerate what thou hast<br>done. When Yuyudhana had said these words, Pradyumna, that foremost of<br>car-warriors, applauded them, expressing his disregard for the son of<br>Hridika.<br><br>"Highly incensed at this, Kritavarma, emphasising his disregard for<br>Satyaki, by pointing to him with his left hand, said these words:<br>Professing thyself to be a hero, how couldst thou so cruelly slay the<br>armless Bhurishrava who, on the field of battle, ( gave up all hostile<br>intentions and) sat in praya?<br><br>"Hearing these words of his, Keshava, that slayer of hostile heroes,<br>giving way to wrath, cast an angry glance at Kritavarma. Then Satyaki<br>informed the slayer of Madhu as to how Kritavarma had behaved towards<br>Satrajit for taking away from him the celebrated gem Syamantaka. Hearing<br>the narrative, Satyabhama, giving way to wrath and tears, approached<br>Keshava and sitting on his lap enhanced his anger (for Kritavarma). Then<br>rising up in a rage, Satyaki said, I swear to thee by Truth that I shall<br>soon cause this one to follow in the wake of the five sons of Draupadi,<br>and of Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandithey that were slain by this sinful<br>wretch, while they were asleep, with the assistance of Dronas son. O thou<br>of slender waist, Kritavarmas period of life and fame have come to their<br>end.<br><br>"Having said these words, Satyaki rushed at Kritavarma and severed his<br>head with a sword in the very sight of Keshava. Yuyudhana, having<br>achieved this feat, began to strike down others there present. Hrishikesa<br>ran to prevent him from doing further mischief. At that time, however, O<br>monarch, the Bhojas and Andhakas, impelled by the perverseness of the<br>hour that had come upon them, all became as one man and surrounded the<br>son of Sini. Janardana of mighty energy, knowing the character of the<br>hour, stood unmoved without giving way to anger at the sight of those<br>heroes rushing in wrath at Satyaki from every side. Urged by fate and<br>inebriated with drink, they began to strike Yuyudhana with the pots from<br>which they had been eating. When the son of Sini was being thus<br>assaulted, Rukminis son became highly enraged. He rushed forward for<br>rescuing Satyaki who was engaged with the Bhojas and the Andhakas. Endued<br>with might of arms and wealth of energy, those two heroes exerted<br>themselves with great courage. But as the odds were overwhelming, both of<br>them were slain in the very sight of Krishna. The delighter of the Yadus,<br>beholding his own son, and the son of Sini too, slain, took up, in wrath,<br>a handful of the Eraka grass that grew there. That handful of grass<br>became a terrible bolt of iron endued with the energy of the thunderbolt.<br>With it Krishna slew all those that came before him. Then the Andhakas<br>and the Bhojas, the Saineyas and the Vrishnis, urged by Time, struck one<br>another in that fearful melee. Indeed, O king, whoever amongst them took<br>up in wrath a few blades of the Eraka grass, these, in his hands, became<br>soon converted into a thunderbolt, O puissant one. Every blade of grass<br>there was seen to be converted into a terrible iron bolt. All this, know,<br>O king, was due to the curse denounced by Brahmanas. He who hurled a<br>blade of grass saw that it pierced through even such things as were<br>utterly impenetrable. In fact, every blade was seen to become a terrible<br>bolt having the force of thunder. Son killed sire, and sire killed son, O<br>Bharata. Inebriated with wine, they rushed and fell upon one another. The<br>Kukuras and the Andhakas met with destruction like insects rushing at a<br>blazing fire. As they were thus being slaughtered, no one among them<br>thought of escaping by fight. Knowing that the hour of destruction had<br>come, the mighty-armed Keshava stood there, eyeing everything. Indeed,<br>the slayer of Madhu stood, raising a bolt of iron formed of a blade of<br>grass. Beholding that Samva was slain, as also Charudeshna and Pradyumna<br>and Aniruddha, Madhava became filled with rage. Beholding Gada lying dead<br>on the ground, his wrath became enhanced. The wielder of Sarnga and the<br>discus and the mace then exterminated the Vrishnis and the Andhakas.<br>Hear, O king, what that conquerer of hostile towns, Vabhru of mighty<br>energy and Daruka then said to Krishna, O holy one, a very large number<br>of men has been slain by thee. Turn now to where Rama has gone. We wish<br>to go there where he has proceeded."
