                            Vaishampayana said: "While the Vrishnis and the Andhakas were thus<br>endeavouring (to avoid the impending calamity), the embodied form of Time<br>(death) every day wandered about their houses. He looked like a man of<br>terrible and fierce aspect. Of bald head, he was black and of tawny<br>complexion. Sometimes he was seen by the Vrishnis as he peered into their<br>houses. The mighty bowmen among the Vrishnis shot hundreds and thousands<br>of shafts at him, but none of these succeeded in piercing him, for he was<br>none else than the Destroyer of all creatures. Day by day strong winds<br>blew, and many were the evil omens that arose, awful and foreboding the<br>destruction of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas. The streets swarmed with<br>rats and mice. Earthen pots showed cracks or broke from no apparent<br>cause. At night, the rats and mice ate away the hair and nails of<br>slumbering men. Sarikas chirped, sitting within the houses of the<br>Vrishnis. The noise made by those birds ceased not for even a short while<br>by day or by night. The Sarashas were heard to imitate the hooting of the<br>owl, and goats imitated the cries, O Bharata, of jackals. Many birds<br>appeared, impelled by Death, that were pale of complexion but that had<br>legs red of hue. Pigeons were seen to always disport in the houses of the<br>Vrishnis. Asses were born of kine, and elephants of mules. Cats were born<br>of bitches, and mouse of the mongoose. The Vrishnis, committing sinful<br>acts, were not seen to feel any shame. They showed disregard for<br>Brahmanas and the Pitris and the deities, They insulted and humiliated<br>their preceptors and seniors. Only Rama and Janardana acted differently.<br>Wives deceived their husbands, and husbands deceived their wives. Fires,<br>when ignited, cast their flames towards the left. Sometimes they threw<br>out flames whose splendour was blue and red. The Sun, whether when rising<br>or setting over the city, seemed to be surrounded by headless trunks of<br>human form. In cook rooms, upon food that was clean and well-boiled, were<br>seen, when it was served out for eating, innumerable worms of diverse<br>kinds. When Brahmanas, receiving gifts, blessed the day or the hour<br>(fixed for this or that undertaking) or when high-souled men were engaged<br>in silent recitations, the heavy tread was heard of innumerable men<br>running about, but no one could be seen to whom the sound of such tread<br>could be ascribed. The constellations were repeatedly seen to be struck<br>by the planets. None amongst the Yadavas could, however, obtain a sight<br>of the constellation of his birth. When the Panchajanya was blown in<br>their houses, asses of dissonant and awful voice brayed aloud from every<br>direction. "Beholding these signs that indicated the perverse course of<br>Time, and seeing that the day of the new moon coincided with the<br>thirteenth (and the fourteenth) lunation, Hrishikesa, summoning the<br>Yadavas, said unto them these words: The fourteenth lunation has been<br>made the fifteenth by Rahu once more. Such a day had happened at the time<br>of the great battle of the Bharatas. It has once more appeared, it seems,<br>for our destruction. "The slayer of Keshi, Janardana, thinking upon the<br>omens that Time showed, understood that the thirty-sixth year had come,<br>and that what Gandhari, burning with grief on account of the death of her<br>sons, and deprived of all her kinsmen, had said was about to transpire.<br>The present is exactly similar to that time when Yudhishthira noted at<br>such awful omens when the two armies had been arrayed in order of battle.<br>Vasudeva, having said so, endeavoured to bring about those occurrences<br>which would make Gandharis words true. That chastiser of foes commanded<br>the Vrishnis to make a pilgrimage to some sacred water. The messengers<br>forthwith proclaimed at the command of Keshava that the Vrishnis should<br>make a journey to the sea-coast for bathing in the sacred waters of the<br>ocean."
