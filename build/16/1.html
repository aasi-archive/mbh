                            Om! Having bowed down unto Narayana, and to Nara, the foremost of men, as<br>also to the goddess Sarasvati, should the word "Jaya" be uttered.<br><br>Vaishampayana said: "When the thirty-sixth year (after the battle) was<br>reached, the delighter of the Kurus, Yudhishthira, beheld many unusual<br>portents. Winds, dry and strong, and showering gravels, blew from every<br>side. Birds began to wheel, making circles from right to left. The great<br>rivers ran in opposite directions. The horizon on every side seemed to be<br>always covered with fog. Meteors, showering (blazing) coals, fell on the<br>Earth from the sky. The Suns disc, O king, seemed to be always covered<br>with dust. At its rise, the great luminary of day was shorn of splendour<br>and seemed to be crossed by headless trunks (of human beings). Fierce<br>circles of light were seen every day around both the Sun and the Moon.<br>These circles showed three hues. Their edges seemed to be black and rough<br>and ashy-red in colour. These and many other omens, foreshadowing fear<br>and danger, were seen, O king, and filled the hearts of men with anxiety.<br>A little while after, the Kuru king Yudhishthira heard of the wholesale<br>carnage of the Vrishnis in consequence of the iron bolt. The son of<br>Pandu, hearing that only Vasudeva and Rama had escaped with life,<br>summoned his brothers and took counsel with them as to what they should<br>do. Meeting with one another, they became greatly distressed upon hearing<br>that the Vrishnis had met with destruction through the Brahmanas rod of<br>chastisement. The death of Vasudeva, like the drying up of the ocean,<br>those heroes could not believe. In fact the destruction of the wielder of<br>Saranga was incredible to them. Informed of the incident about the iron<br>bolt, the Pandavas became filled with grief and sorrow. In fact, they sat<br>down, utterly cheerless and penetrated with blank despair."<br><br>Janamejaya said: "Indeed, O holy one, how was it that the Andhakas along<br>with Vrishnis, and those great car-warriors, the Bhojas, met with<br>destruction in the very sight of Vasudeva?"<br><br>Vaishampayana continued: "When the thirty-sixth year was reached (after<br>the great battle) a great calamity overtook the Vrishnis. Impelled by<br>Time, they all met with destruction in consequence of the iron bolt."<br><br>Janamejaya said: "Cursed by whom did those heroes, the Vrishnis, the<br>Andhakas, and the Bhojas, met with destruction? O foremost regenerate<br>persons, do thou tell me this in detail.<br><br>Vaishampayana continued: "One day, the Vrishni heroes numbering Sarana<br>amongst them, saw Vishvamitra and Kanwa and Narada arrived at Dwaraka.<br>Afflicted by the rod of chastisement wielded by the deities, those<br>heroes, causing Samva to be disguised like a woman, approached those<br>ascetics and said, This one is the wife of Vabhru of immeasurable energy<br>who is desirous of having a son. Ye Rishis, do you know for certain what<br>this one will bring forth?<br><br>"Hear now, O king, what those ascetics, attempted to be thus deceived,<br>said: This heir of Vasudeva, by name Samva, will bring forth a fierce<br>iron bolt for the destruction of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas. Ye wicked<br>and cruel ones, intoxicated with pride, through that iron bolt ye will<br>become the exterminators of your race with the exception of Rama and<br>Janarddana. The blessed hero armed with the plough will enter the ocean,<br>casting off his body, while a hunter of the name of Jara will pierce the<br>high-souled Krishna while lying on the ground.<br><br>"Endeavoured to be deceived by those wicked ones, those ascetics, with<br>eyes red in wrath, looked at each other and uttered those words. Having<br>said so they then proceeded to see Keshava. The slayer of Madhu, informed<br>of what had taken place, summoned all the Vrishnis and told them of it.<br>Possessed of great intelligence and fully acquainted with what the end of<br>his race would be, he simply said that that which was destined would<br>surely happen. Hrishikesa having said so, entered his mansion. The Lord<br>of the universe did not wish to ordain otherwise. When the next day came,<br>Samva actually brought forth an iron bolt through which all the<br>individuals in the race of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas became consumed<br>into ashes. Indeed, for the destruction of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas,<br>Samva brought forth, through that curse, a fierce iron bolt that looked<br>like a gigantic messenger of death. The fact was duly reported to the<br>king. In great distress of mind, the king (Ugrasena) caused that iron<br>bolt to be reduced into fine powder. Men were employed, O king, to cast<br>that powder into the sea. At the command of Ahuka, of Janarddana, of<br>Rama, and of the high-souled Vabhru, it was, again, proclaimed throughout<br>the city that from that day, among all the Vrishnis and the Andhakas no<br>one should manufacture wines and intoxicating spirits of any kind, and<br>that whoever would secretly manufacture wines and spirits should be<br>impaled alive with all his kinsmen. Through fear of the king, and knowing<br>that it was the command of Rama also of unimpeachable deeds, all the<br>citizens bound themselves by a rule and abstained from manufacturing<br>wines and spirits."
