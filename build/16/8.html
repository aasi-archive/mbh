                            Vaishampayana said: "As Arjuna entered the asylum of the truthful Rishi,<br>he beheld the son of Satyavati seated in a secluded spot.<br><br>"Approaching that Rishi of high vows and endued with a knowledge of all<br>duties, he said, I am Arjuna, and then awaited his pleasure. Satyavatis<br>son, endued with high penances, answered, saying Welcome! Of tranquil<br>soul, the great Muni further said, Take thy seat. Seeing that the son of<br>Pritha was exceedingly cheerless and breathing heavy sighs repeatedly and<br>filled with despair, Vyasa addressed him, saying, "Hast thou been<br>sprinkled with water from anybodys nails or hair, or the end of anybodys<br>cloth, or from the mouth of a jar? Hast thou had sexual congress with any<br>woman before the cessation of her functional flow? Hast thou slain a<br>Brahmana? Hast thou been vanquished in battle? Thou lookest like one<br>shorn of prosperity. I do not know that thou hast been defeated by<br>anyone. Why then, O chief of Bharatas race, this exceedingly dejected<br>aspect? It behoveth thee, O son of Pritha, to tell me all, if, indeed,<br>there be no harm in telling it."<br><br>"Arjuna said, He whose complexion was like that of a (newly-risen) cloud,<br>he whose eyes were like a pair of large lotus petals, Krishna, has, with<br>Rama, cast off his body and ascended to Heaven. At Prabhasa, through iron<br>bolts generated by the curse denounced by Brahmanas, the destruction has<br>taken place of the Vrishni heroes. Awful hath that carnage been, and not<br>even a single hero has escaped. The heroes of the Bhoja, the Andhaka, and<br>the Vrishni races, O Brahmana, who were all endued with high souls, great<br>might, and leonine pride, have slaughtered one another in battle.<br>Possessed of arms that looked like maces of iron, and capable of bearing<br>the strokes of heavy clubs and darts, alas, they have all been slain with<br>blades of Eraka grass. Behold the perverse course of Time. 500,000<br>mighty-armed warriors have thus been laid low. Encountering one another,<br>they have met with destruction. Thinking repeatedly of this carnage of<br>the Yadava warriors of immeasurable energy and of the illustrious<br>Krishna, I fail to derive peace of mind. The death of the wielder of<br>Sarnga is as incredible as the drying up of the ocean, the displacement<br>of a mountain, the falling down of the vault of heaven, or the cooling<br>property of fire. Deprived of the company of the Vrishni heroes, I desire<br>not to live in this world. Another incident has happened that is more<br>painful than this, O thou that art possessed of wealth of penances.<br>Repeatedly thinking of it, my heart is breaking. In my very sight, O<br>Brahmana, thousands of Vrishni ladies were carried away by the Abhiras of<br>the country of the five waters, who assailed us. Taking up my bow I found<br>myself unequal to even string it. The might that had existed in my arms<br>seemed to have disappeared on that occasion. O great ascetic, my weapons<br>of diverse kinds failed to make their appearance. Soon, again, my shafts<br>became exhausted. That person of immeasurable soul, of four arms,<br>wielding the conch, the discus, and the mace, clad in yellow robes, dark<br>of complexion, and possessing eyes resembling lotus-petals, is no longer<br>seen by me. Alas, reft of Govinda, what have I to live for, dragging my<br>life in sorrow? He who used to stalk in advance of my car, that divine<br>form endued with great splendour and unfading puissance, consuming as he<br>proceeded all hostile warriors, can no longer be seen by me. No longer<br>beholding him who by his energy first burnt all hostile troops whom I<br>afterwards despatched with shafts sped from Gandiva, I am filled with<br>grief and my head swims, O best of men. Penetrated with cheerlessness and<br>despair, I fail to obtain peace of mind. I dare not live, reft of the<br>heroic Janardana. As soon as I heard that Vishnu had left the Earth, my<br>eyes became dim and all things disappeared from my vision. O best of men,<br>it behoveth thee to tell me what is good for me now, for I am now a<br>wanderer with an empty heart, despoiled of my kinsmen and of my<br>possession.<br><br>"Vyasa said, The mighty car-warriors of the Vrishni and the Andhaka races<br>have all been consumed by the Brahmanas curse. O chief of Kurus race, it<br>behoveth thee not to grieve for their destruction. That which has<br>happened had been ordained. It was the destiny of those high-souled<br>warriors. Krishna suffered it to take place although he was fully<br>competent to baffle it. Govinda was able to alter the very course of the<br>universe with all its mobile and immobile creatures. What need then be<br>said of the curse of even high-souled Brahmanas? He who used to proceed<br>in front of thy car, armed with discus and mace, through affection for<br>thee, was the four-armed Vasudeva, that ancient rishi. That high-souled<br>one of expansive eyes, Krishna, having lightened the burthen of the Earth<br>and cast off his (human) body, has attained to his own high seat. By thee<br>also, O foremost of men, with Bhima for thy helpmate and the twins, O<br>mighty-armed hero, has the great work of the gods been accomplished. O<br>foremost one of Kurus race, I regard thee and thy brothers as crowned<br>with success, for ye have accomplished the great purpose of your lives.<br>The time has come for your departure from the world. Even this, O<br>puissant one, is what is beneficial for you now. Even thus, understanding<br>and prowess and foresight, O Bharata, arise when days of prosperity have<br>not outrun. These very acquisitions disappear when the hour of adversity<br>comes. All this has Time for its root. Time is, indeed, the seed of the<br>universe, O Dhananjaya. It is Time, again, that withdraws everything at<br>its pleasure. One becomes mighty, and, again, losing that might, becomes<br>weak. One becomes a master and rules others, and, again, losing that<br>position, becomes a servant for obeying the behests of others. Thy<br>weapons, having achieved success, have gone away to the place they came<br>from. They will, again, come into thy hands when the Time for their<br>coming approaches. The time has come, O Bharata, for you all to attain to<br>the highest goal. Even this is what I regard to be highly beneficial for<br>you all, O chief of Bharatas race."<br><br>Vaishampayana continued: "Having heard these words of Vyasa of<br>immeasurable energy, the son of Pritha, receiving his permission,<br>returned to the city named after the elephant. Entering it, the hero<br>approached Yudhishthira and informed him of all that had taken place with<br>reference to the Vrishnis."<br><br>The end of Mausala-parv
