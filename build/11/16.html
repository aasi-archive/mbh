                            (Stri-vilapa-parva)<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "Having said these words, Gandhari, though staying on<br>that spot which was distant from the field of battle, beheld, with her<br>spiritual eye, the slaughter of the Kurus. Devoted to her lord, that<br>highly blessed lady had always practised high vows. Undergoing the<br>severest penances, she was always truthful in her speech. In consequence<br>of the gift of the boon by the great rishi Vyasa of sanctified deeds, she<br>became possessed of spiritual knowledge and power. Piteous were the<br>lamentations in which that dame then indulged. Endued with great<br>intelligence, the Kuru dame saw, from a distance, but as if from a near<br>point, that field of battle, terrible to behold and full of wonderful<br>sights, of those foremost of fighters. Scattered all over with bones and<br>hair, and covered with streams of blood, that field was strewn with<br>thousands upon thousands of dead bodies on every side. Covered with the<br>blood of elephants and horses and car-warriors and combatants of other<br>kinds, it teemed with headless trunks and trunkless heads. And it<br>resounded with the cries of elephants and steeds and men and women and<br>abounded with jackals and cranes and ravens and kankas and crows. And it<br>was the sporting ground of rakshasas subsisting on human flesh. And it<br>swarmed with ospreys and vultures and resounded with the inauspicious<br>howls of jackals. Then king Dhritarashtra, at the command of Vyasa, and<br>all the sons of Pandu with Yudhishthira at their head, with Vasudeva and<br>all the Kuru ladies, proceeded to the field of battle. Those ladies,<br>bereaved of their lords, having reached Kurukshetra, beheld their slain<br>brothers and sons and sires and husbands lying on the ground, and in<br>course of being devoured by beasts of prey and wolves and ravens and<br>crows and ghosts and pishacas and rakshasas and diverse other wanderers<br>of the night. Beholding that carnage which resembled the sights seen on<br>the sporting ground of Rudra, the ladies uttered loud shrieks and quickly<br>alighted from their costly vehicles. Witnessing sights the like of which<br>they had never before witnessed, the Bharata ladies felt their limbs to<br>be deprived of strength and fell down on the ground. Others became so<br>stupefied that they lost all their senses. Indeed, the Pancala and the<br>Kuru ladies were plunged into unutterable distress. Beholding that<br>dreadful field of battle resounding on every direction with the cries of<br>those grief-stricken ladies, the daughter of Subala, acquainted with<br>every duty, addressed the lotus-eyed Keshava, that foremost of all men.<br>Witnessing that universal slaughter of the Kurus and filled with grief at<br>the sight, she said these words: Behold, O lotus-eyed Madhava, these<br>daughters-in-law of mine! Deprived of their lords, they are uttering,<br>with dishevelled hair, piteous cries of woe like a flight of she-ospreys.<br>Meeting with those dead bodies, they are calling back to their memories<br>the great Bharata chiefs. They are running hither and thither in large<br>bands towards their sons and brothers and sires and husbands. Behold, O<br>mighty-armed one, the field is covered with mothers of heroes, all of<br>whom, however, have been bereaved of children. There, those portions<br>again are covered with spouses of heroes, who have, however, been<br>bereaved of their spouses! Behold, the field of battle is adorned with<br>those tigers among men, Bhishma and Karna and Abhimanyu and Drona and<br>Drupada and Shalya, as if with blazing fires. Behold, it is adorned also<br>with the golden coats of mail, and with the costly gems, of high-souled<br>warriors, and with their angadas, and keyuras and garlands. Behold, it is<br>strewn with darts and spiked clubs hurled by heroic hands, and swords and<br>diverse kinds of keen shafts and bows. Beasts of prey, assembled<br>together, are standing or sporting or lying down as it likes them!<br>Behold, O puissant hero, the field of battle is even such. At this sight,<br>O Janardana, I am burning with grief. In the destruction of the Pancalas<br>and the Kurus, O slayer of Madhu, I think, the five elements (of which<br>everything is made) have been destroyed. Fierce vultures and other birds,<br>in thousands, are dragging those blood-dyed bodies, and seizing them by<br>their armour, are devouring them. Who is there that could think of the<br>death of such heroes as Jayadratha and Karna and Drona and Bhishma and<br>Abhimanyu? Alas, though incapable of being slain, they have yet been<br>slain, O destroyer of Madhu! Behold, vultures and kankas and ravens and<br>hawks and dogs and jackals are feasting upon them. There, those tigers<br>among men, that fought on Duryodhanas side, and took the field in wrath,<br>are now lying like extinguished fires. All of them are worthy of sleeping<br>on soft and clean beds. But, alas, plunged into distress, they are<br>sleeping today on the bare ground. Bards reciting their praises used to<br>delight them before at proper times. They are now listening to the fierce<br>and inauspicious cries of jackals. Those illustrious heroes who used<br>formerly to sleep on costly beds with their limbs smeared with sandal<br>paste and powdered aloe, alas, now sleep on the dust! These vultures and<br>wolves and ravens have now become their ornaments. Repeatedly uttering<br>inauspicious and fierce cries those creatures are now dragging their<br>bodies. Delighting in battle, those heroes, looking cheerful, have still<br>beside them their keen shafts, well-tempered swords, and bright maces, as<br>if life has not yet departed from them. Many foremost of heroes,<br>possessed of beauty and fair complexions and adorned with garlands of<br>gold, are sleeping on the ground. Behold, beasts of prey are dragging and<br>tearing them. Others, with massive arms, are sleeping with maces in their<br>embrace, as if those were beloved wives. Others, still cased in armour,<br>are holding in their hands their bright weapons. Beasts of prey are not<br>mangling them, O Janardana, regarding them to be still alive. The<br>beautiful garlands of pure gold on the necks of other illustrious heroes,<br>as the latter are being dragged by carnivorous creatures, are scattered<br>about on every side. There, those fierce wolves, numbering in thousands,<br>are dragging the golden chains round the necks of many illustrious heroes<br>stilled by death. Many, whom bards well-trained to their work formerly<br>used, with their hymns and eulogies of grave import, to delight every<br>morning, are now surrounded by fair ladies stricken with grief and<br>weeping and crying around them in woe, O tiger of Vrishnis race! The<br>faces of those beautiful ladies, O Keshava, though pale, look resplendent<br>still, like an assemblage of red lotuses! Those Kuru ladies have ceased<br>to weep, with their respective followers and companions. They are all<br>filled with anxiety. Overwhelmed with sorrow, they are running hither and<br>thither. The faces of those fair ones have, with weeping and anger,<br>become resplendent as the morning sun or gold or burnished copper.<br>Hearing each others lamentations of incomplete sense, those ladies, in<br>consequence of the loud wails of woe bursting from every side, are unable<br>to catch each others meaning. Some amongst them, drawing long sighs and<br>indulging in repeated lamentations, are stupefied by grief and are<br>abondoning their life-breaths. Many of them, beholding the bodies (of<br>their sons, husbands, or sires), are weeping and setting up loud wails.<br>Others are striking their heads with their own soft hands. The earth,<br>strewn with severed heads and hands and other limbs mingled together and<br>gathered in large heaps, looks resplendent with these signs of havoc!<br>Beholding many headless trunks of great beauty, and many heads without<br>trunks, those fair ones have been lying senseless on the ground for a<br>long while. Uniting particular heads with particular trunks, those<br>ladies, senseless with grief, are again discovering their mistakes and<br>saying, "This is not this ones," and are weeping more bitterly! Others,<br>uniting arms and thighs and feet, cut off with shafts, are giving way to<br>grief and losing their senses repeatedly (at the sight of the restored<br>forms). Some amongst the Bharata ladies, beholding the bodies of their<br>lords,&#8212;bodies that have been mangled by animals and birds and severed of<br>their heads,&#8212;are not succeeding in recognising them. Others, beholding<br>their brothers, sires, sons, and husbands slain by foes, are, O destroyer<br>of Madhu, striking their heads with their own hands. Miry with flesh and<br>blood, the Earth has become impassable with arms still holding swords in<br>their grasp, and with heads adorned with earrings. Beholding the field<br>strewn with their brothers and sires, and sons, those faultless ladies,<br>who had never before suffered the least distress, are now plunged into<br>unutterable woe. Behold, O Janardana, those numerous bevies of<br>Dhritarashtras daughters-in-law, resembling successive multitudes of<br>handsome fillies adorned with excellent manes! What, O Keshava, can be a<br>sadder spectacle for me to behold than that presented by those ladies of<br>fair forms who have assumed such an aspect? Without doubt, I must have<br>perpetrated great sins in my former lives, since I am beholding, O<br>Keshava, my sons and grandsons and brothers all slain by foes. While<br>indulging in such lamentations in grief, Gandharis eyes fell upon her son<br>(Duryodhana)."
