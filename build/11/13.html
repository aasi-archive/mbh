                            Vaishampayana said, "Certain maid-servants then came to the king for<br>washing him. After he had been duly washed, the slayer of Madhu again<br>addressed him, saying, Thou hast, O king, read the Vedas and diverse<br>scriptures. Thou hast heard all old histories, and everything about the<br>duties of kings. Thou art learned, possessed of great wisdom, and<br>indifferent to strength and weakness. Why then dost thou cherish such<br>wrath when all that has overtaken thee is the result of thy own fault? I<br>spoke to thee before the battle. Both Bhishma and Drona, O Bharata, did<br>the same, as also Vidura and Sanjaya. Thou didst not, however, then<br>follow our advice. Indeed, though exhorted by us, thou didst not yet act<br>according to the counsels we offered, knowing that the Pandavas were<br>superior to thee and thine, O Kauravya, in strength and courage. That<br>king who is capable of seeing his own faults and knows the distinctions<br>of place and time, obtains great prosperity. That person, however, who,<br>though counselled by well-wishers, does not accept their words, good or<br>bad, meets with distress and is obliged to grieve in consequence of the<br>evil policy he pursues. Observe thou a different course of life now, O<br>Bharata! Thou didst not keep thy soul under restraint, but suffered<br>thyself to be ruled by Duryodhana. That which has come upon thee is due<br>to thy own fault. Why then dost thou seek to slay Bhima? Recollecting thy<br>own faults, govern thy wrath now. That mean wretch who had, from pride,<br>caused the princess of Pancala to be brought into the assembly has been<br>slain by Bhimasena in just revenge. Look at thy own evil acts as also at<br>those of thy wicked-souled son. The sons of Pandu are perfectly innocent.<br>Yet have they been treated most cruelly by thee and him."<br><br>Vaishampayana continued, "After he had thus been told nothing but the<br>truth by Krishna, O monarch, king Dhritarashtra replied unto Devakis son,<br>saying, It is even so, O thou of mighty arms! What thou sayest, O<br>Madhava, is perfectly true. It is parental affection, O thou of righteous<br>soul, that caused me to fall away from righteousness. By good luck, that<br>tiger among men, the mighty Bhima of true prowess, protected by thee,<br>came not within my embrace. Now, however, I am free from wrath and fever.<br>I desire eagerly, O Madhava, to embrace that hero, the second son of<br>Pandu. When all the kings have been dead, when my children are no more,<br>upon the sons of Pandu depend my welfare and happiness. Having said these<br>words, the old king then embraced those princes of excellent frames,<br>Bhima and Dhananjaya, and those two foremost of men, the two sons of<br>Madri, and wept, and comforted and pronounced blessings upon them."
