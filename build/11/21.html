                            "Gandhari said, Then the mighty Karna, that great bowman, lieth on the<br>ground! In battle he was like a blazing fire! That fire, however, hath<br>now been extinguished by the energy of Partha. Behold, Vikartanas son<br>Karna, after having slain many atirathas, has been prostrated on the bare<br>ground, and is drenched with blood. Wrathful and possessed of great<br>energy, he was a great bowman and a mighty car-warrior. Slain in battle<br>by the wielder of gandiva, that hero now sleepeth on the ground. My sons,<br>those mighty car-warriors, from fear of the Pandavas, fought, placing<br>Karna at their head, like a herd of elephants with its leader to the<br>fore. Alas, like a tiger slain by a lion, or an elephant by an infuriated<br>elephant, that warrior hath been slain in battle by Savyasaci. Assembled<br>together, O tiger among men, the wives of that warrior, with dishevelled<br>tresses and loud wails of grief, are sitting around that fallen hero!<br>Filled with anxiety caused by the thoughts of that warrior, king<br>Yudhishthira the just could not, for thirteen years, obtain a wink of<br>sleep! Incapable of being checked by foes in battle like Maghavat himself<br>who is invincible by enemies, Karna was like the all-destroying fire of<br>fierce flames at the end of the yuga, and immovable like Himavat himself!<br>That hero became the protector of Dhritarashtras son, O Madhava! Alas,<br>deprived of life, he now lieth on the bare ground, like a tree prostrated<br>by the wind! Behold, the wife of Karna and mother of Vrishasena, is<br>indulging in piteous lamentations and crying and weeping and falling upon<br>the ground! Even now she exclaims, "Without doubt, thy preceptors curse<br>hath pursued thee! When the wheel of thy car was swallowed up by the<br>Earth, the cruel Dhananjaya cut off thy head with an arrow! Alas, fie (on<br>the heroism and skill)!" That lady, the mother of Sushena, exceedingly<br>afflicted and uttering cries of woe, is falling down, deprived of her<br>senses, at the sight of the mighty-armed and brave Karna prostrated on<br>the earth, with his waist still encircled with a belt of gold.<br>Carnivorous creatures, feeding on the body of that illustrious hero, have<br>reduced it to very small dimensions. The sight is not gladdening, like<br>that of the moon on the fourteenth night of the dark fortnight. Falling<br>down on the earth, the cheerless dame is rising up again. Burning with<br>grief on account of the death of her son also, she cometh and smelleth<br>the face of her lord!"
