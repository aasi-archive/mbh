                            "Dhritarashtra said, O foremost speakers, how may the wilderness of this<br>world be known? I desire to hear this. Asked by me, tell me this.<br><br>"Vidura said, I will describe to thee all the acts of creatures from<br>their first conception. At the outset it lives in the admixture of blood<br>and the vital fluid. Then it grows little by little. Then on the expiry<br>of the fifth month it assumes shape. It next becomes a foetus with all<br>its limbs completed, and lives in a very impure place, covered with flesh<br>and blood. Then, through the action of the wind, its lower limbs are<br>turned upwards and the head comes downwards. Arriving in this posture at<br>the mouth of the uterus, it suffers manifold woes. In consequence of the<br>contractions of the uterus, the creature then comes out of it, endued<br>with the results of all his previous acts. He then encounters in this<br>world other evils that rush towards him. Calamities proceed towards him<br>like dogs at the scent of meat. Next diverse diseases approach him while<br>he is enchained by his previous acts. Bound by the chains of the senses<br>and women and wealth and other sweet things of life, diverse evil<br>practices also approach him then, O king! Seized by these, he never<br>obtains happiness. At that season he succeeds not in obtaining the fruit<br>of his acts, right or wrong. They, however, that set their hearts on<br>reflection, succeed in protecting their souls. The person governed by his<br>senses does not know that death has come at his door. At last, dragged by<br>the messengers of the Destroyer, he meets with destruction at the<br>appointed time. Agitated by his senses, for whatever good and evil has<br>been done at the outset and having enjoyed or suffered the fruits of<br>these, he once more becomes indifferent to his acts of self-slaughter.<br>Alas, the world is deceived, and covetousness brings it under its<br>dominion. Deprived of understanding by covetousness, wrath, and fear, one<br>knows not ones own self. Filled with joy at ones own respectability of<br>birth, one is seen to traduce those that are not high-born. Swelled also<br>with pride of wealth, one is seen to contemn the poor. One regards others<br>to be ignorant fools, but seldom takes a survey of ones own self. One<br>attributes faults to others but is never desirous to punish ones own<br>self. Since the wise and the ignorant, the rich and the poor, the<br>high-born and the lowborn, the honoured and the dishonoured, all go to<br>the place of the dead and sleep there freed from every anxiety, with<br>bodies divested of flesh and full only of bones united by dried-up<br>tendons, whom amongst them would the survivors look upon as distinguished<br>above the others and by what signs would they ascertain the attributes of<br>birth and beauty? When all, stretched after the same fashion, sleep on<br>the bare ground, why then should men, taking leave of their senses,<br>desire to deceive one another? He that, looking at this saying (in the<br>scriptures) with his own eyes or hearing it from others, practiseth<br>virtue in this unstable world of life and adhereth to it from early age,<br>attaineth to the highest end. Learning all this, he that adhereth to<br>Truth, O king, succeedeth in passing over all paths."
