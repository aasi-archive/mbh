                            Vaishampayana said, "Dhritarashtra had not proceeded for more than two<br>miles when he met with those three great car-warriors, Sharadvatas son<br>Kripa, Dronas son (Ashvatthama), and Kritavarma. As soon as the latter<br>obtained a sight of the blind monarch possessed of great power, the three<br>heroes sighed in grief and with voices choked in tears weepingly<br>addressed him, saying, Thy royal son, O king, having achieved the most<br>difficult feats, has, with all his followers, gone to the region of<br>Indra. We are the only three car-warriors of Duryodhanas army that have<br>escaped with life. All the others, O bull of Bharatas race, have<br>perished. Having said these words unto the king, Sharadvatas son Kripa,<br>addressing the grief-afflicted Gandhari, said these words unto her, Thy<br>sons have fallen while engaged in achieving feats worthy of heroes, while<br>fearlessly fighting in battle and striking down large numbers of foes.<br>Without doubt, having obtained those bright worlds that are attainable<br>only by the use of weapons, they are sporting there like celestials,<br>having assumed resplendent forms. Amongst those heroes there was no one<br>that turned back from battle. Every one of them has fallen at the end or<br>edge of weapons. None of them joined his hands, begging for quarter.<br>Death in battle at the end or edge of weapons has been said by the<br>ancients to be the highest end that a Kshatriya can obtain. It behoveth<br>thee not, therefore, to grieve for any of them. Their foes, O queen, the<br>Pandavas, too, have not been more fortunate. Listen, what we, headed by<br>Ashvatthama, have done unto them. Learning that thy son had been slain<br>unrighteously by Bhima, we slaughtered the Pandavas after entering their<br>camp buried in sleep. All the Pancalas have been slain. Indeed, all the<br>sons of Drupada, as also all the sons of Draupadi, have been slaughtered.<br>Having caused this carnage of the sons of our foes, we are flying away<br>since we three are incapable of standing in battle with them. Our foes,<br>the Pandavas, are all heroes and mighty bowmen. They will soon come up<br>with us, filled with rage, for taking vengeance on us. Hearing the<br>slaughter of their sons, those bulls among men, infuriated with rage,<br>those heroes, O illustrious lady, will speedily pursue our track. Having<br>caused a carnage (in their sleeping camp) we dare not stay. Grant us<br>permission, O queen! It behoveth thee not to set thy heart on sorrow.<br>Grant us thy permission also, O king! Summon all thy fortitude. Do thou<br>also observe the duties of a Kshatriya in their highest form. Having said<br>these words unto the king, and circumambulating him, Kripa and Kritavarma<br>and Dronas son, O Bharata, without being able to withdraw their eyes from<br>king Dhritarashtra possessed of great wisdom, urged their steeds towards<br>the banks of the Ganga. Moving away from that spot, O king, those great<br>car-warriors, with hearts plunged in anxiety, took one anothers leave and<br>separated from one another. Sharadvatas son, Kripa, went to Hastinapura;<br>Hridikas son repaired to his own kingdom; while the son of Drona set for<br>the asylum of Vyasa. Even thus those heroes, who had offended the<br>high-souled sons of Pandu, respectively proceeded to the places they<br>selected, afflicted with fear and casting their eyes on one another.<br>Having met the king thus, those brave chastisers of foes, before the sun<br>rose, went away, O monarch, to the places they chose. It was after this,<br>O king, that the sons of Pandu, those great car-warriors, encountered the<br>son of Drona, and putting forth their prowess, vanquished him, O monarch,<br>(in the way already related)."
