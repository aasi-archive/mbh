                            Vaishampayana said, "Hearing these words of Vidura, that bull of Bharatas<br>race (Dhritarashtra) ordered his car to be yoked. The king once more<br>said, Bring Gandhari hither without delay, and all the Bharata ladies.<br>Bring hither Kunti also, as well as all the other ladies with her. Having<br>said these words unto Vidura, conversant with every duty, Dhritarashtra<br>of righteous soul, deprived of his senses by sorrow, ascended on his car.<br>Then Gandhari, afflicted with grief on account of the death of her sons,<br>accompanied by Kunti and the other ladies of the royal household, came at<br>the command of her lord to that spot where the latter was waiting for<br>her. Afflicted with grief, they came together to the king. As they met,<br>they accosted each other and uttered loud wails of woe. Then Vidura, who<br>had become more afflicted than those ladies, began to comfort them.<br>Placing those weeping fair ones on the cars that stood ready for them, he<br>set out (with them) from the city. At that time a loud wail of woe arose<br>from every Kuru house. The whole city, including the very children,<br>became exceedingly afflicted with grief. Thoseladies that had not before<br>this been seen by the very gods were now helpless, as they were, for the<br>loss of their lords, seen by the common people. With their beautiful<br>tresses all dishevelled and their ornaments cast off, those ladies, each<br>attired in a single piece of raiment, proceeded most woefully. Indeed,<br>they issued from their houses resembling white mountains, like a dappled<br>herd of deer from their mountain caves after the fall of their leader.<br>These fair ladies, in successive bevies, O king, came out, filled with<br>sorrow, and ran hither and thither like a herd of fillies on a circus<br>yard. Seizing each other by the hand, they uttered loud wails after their<br>sons and brothers and sires. They seemed to exhibit the scene that takes<br>place on the occasion of the universal destruction at the end of the<br>Yuga. Weeping and crying and running hither and thither, and deprived of<br>their senses by grief, they knew not what to do. Those ladies who<br>formerly felt the blush of modesty in the presence of even companions of<br>their own sex, now felt no blush of shame, though scantily clad, in<br>appearing before their mothers-in-law. Formerly they used to comfort each<br>other while afflicted with even slight causes of woe. Stupefied by grief,<br>they now, O king, refrained from even casting their eyes upon each other.<br>Surrounded by those thousands of wailing ladies, the king cheerlessly<br>issued out of the city and proceeded with speed towards the field of<br>battle. Artisans and traders and Vaishyas and all kinds of mechanics,<br>issuing out of the city, followed in the wake of the king. As those<br>ladies, afflicted by the wholesale destruction that had overtaken the<br>Kurus, cried in sorrow, a loud wail arose from among them that seemed to<br>pierce all the worlds. All creatures that heard that wail thought that<br>the hour of universal destruction had come when all things would be<br>consumed by the fire that arises at the end of the Yuga. The citizens<br>also (of Hastinapura), devoted to the house of Kuru, with hearts filled<br>with anxiety at the destruction that had overtaken their rules, set up, O<br>king, a wail that was as loud as that uttered by those ladies."
