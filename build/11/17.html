                            Vaishampayana said, "Beholding Duryodhana, Gandhari, deprived of her<br>senses by grief, suddenly fell down on the earth like an uprooted<br>plantain tree. Having regained her senses soon, she began to weep,<br>repeatedly uttering loud wails at the sight of her son lying on the bare<br>ground, covered with blood. Embracing her son, Gandhari indulged in<br>piteous lamentations for him. Stricken with grief, and with senses<br>exceedingly agitated, the Kuru queen exclaimed, Alas, O son! Alas, O son!<br>Burning with sorrow, the queen drenched with her tears the body of her<br>son, possessed of massive and broad shoulders, and adorned with garlands<br>and collar. Addressing Hrishikesha who stood near, she said, On the eve<br>of this battle, O puissant one, that has exterminated this race, this<br>foremost of kings, O thou of Vrishnis race, said unto me, "In this<br>internecine battle, O mother, wish me victory!" When he had said these<br>words, I myself, knowing that a great calamity had come upon us, told him<br>even this, tiger among men, "Thither is victory where righteousness is.<br>And since, son, thy heart is set on battle, thou wilt, without doubt,<br>obtain those regions that are attainable by (the use of) weapons (and<br>sport there) like a celestial." Even these were the words that I then<br>said unto him. I did not then grieve for my son. I grieve, however, for<br>the helpless Dhritarashtra bereaved of friends and kinsmen. Behold, O<br>Madhava, my son, that foremost of warriors, wrathful, skilled in weapons,<br>and irresistible in battle, sleeping on the bed of heroes. Behold the<br>reverses brought about by Time. This scorcher of foes that used of old to<br>walk at the head of all crowned persons now sleepeth on the dust. Without<br>doubt, the heroic Duryodhana, when he sleeps on that bed which is the<br>heros hath obtained the most unattainable end. Inauspicious jackals are<br>now delighting that prince asleep on the heros bed, who was formerly<br>delighted by the fairest of ladies sitting round him. He who was formerly<br>encircled by kings vying with one another to give him pleasure, alas, he,<br>slain and lying on the ground, is now encircled by vultures! He who was<br>formerly fanned with beautiful fans by fair ladies is now fanned by<br>(carnivorous) birds with flaps of their wings! Possessed of great<br>strength and true prowess, this mighty-armed prince, slain by Bhimasena<br>in battle, sleeps like an elephant slain by a lion! Behold Duryodhana, O<br>Krishna, lying on the bare ground, covered with blood, slain by Bhimasena<br>with his mace. That mighty-armed one who had in battle assembled together<br>eleven akshauhinis of troops, O Keshava, hath, in consequence of his own<br>evil policy, been now slain. Alas, there that great bowman and mighty<br>car-warrior sleeps, slain by Bhimasena, like a tiger slain by a lion!<br>Having disregarded Vidura, as also his own sire, this reckless, foolish,<br>and wicked prince hath succumbed to death, in consequence of his<br>disregard of the old. He who had ruled the earth, without a rival, for<br>thirteen years, alas, that prince, that son of mine, sleepeth to-day on<br>the bare ground, slain by his foes. Not long before, O Krishna, I beheld<br>the Earth, full of elephants and kine and horses, ruled by Duryodhana!<br>Today, O thou of mighty arms, I see her ruled by another, and destitute<br>of elephants and kine and horses! What need have I, O Madhava, of life?<br>Behold, again, this sight that is more painful than the death of my son,<br>the sight of these fair ladies weeping by the side of the slain heroes!<br>Behold, O Krishna, the mother of Lakshmana, that lady of large hips, with<br>her tresses dishevelled, that dear spouse of Duryodhana, resembling a<br>sacrificial altar of gold. Without doubt, this damsel of great<br>intelligence, while her mighty-armed lord was formerly alive, used to<br>sport within the embrace of her lords handsome arms! Why, indeed, does<br>not this heart of mine break into a hundred fragments at the sight of my<br>son and grandson slain in battle? Alas, that faultless lady now smells<br>(the head of) her son covered with blood. Now, again, that lady of fair<br>thighs is gently rubbing Duryodhanas body with her fair hand. At one time<br>she is sorrowing for her lord and at another for her son. At one time she<br>looketh on her lord, at another on her son. Behold, O Madhava, striking<br>her head with her hands, she falls upon the breast of her heroic spouse,<br>the king of the Kurus. Possessed of complexion like that of the filaments<br>of the lotus, she still looketh beautiful like a lotus. The unfortunate<br>princess now rubbeth the face of her son and now that of her lord. If the<br>scriptures and the shrutis be true, without doubt, this king has obtained<br>those regions (of blessedness) that one may win by the use of weapons!"
