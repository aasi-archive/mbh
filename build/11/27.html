                            Vaishampayana said, "Arrived at the auspicious Ganga full of sacred<br>water, containing many lakes, adorned with high banks and broad shores,<br>and having a vast bed, they cast off their ornaments, upper garments, and<br>belts and girdles. The Kuru ladies, crying and afflicted with great<br>grief, offered oblations of water unto their sires and grandsons and<br>brothers and kinsmen and sons and reverend seniors and husbands.<br>Conversant with duties, they also performed the water-rite in honour of<br>their friends. While those wives of heroes were performing this rite in<br>honour of their heroic lords, the access to the stream became easy,<br>although the paths (made by the tread of many feet) disappeared<br>afterwards. The shores of the stream, though crowded with those spouses<br>of heroes, looked as broad as the ocean and presented a spectacle of<br>sorrow and cheerlessness. Then Kunti, O king, in a sudden paroxysm of<br>grief, weepingly addressed her sons in these soft words, That hero and<br>great bowman, that leader of leaders of car-divisions, that warrior<br>distinguished by every mark of heroism, who hath been slain by Arjuna in<br>battle, that warrior whom, ye sons of Pandu, ye took forth, Sutas child<br>born of Radha, that hero who shone in the midst of his forces like the<br>lord Surya himself, who battled with all of you and your followers, who<br>looked resplendent as he commanded the vast force of the Duryodhana, who<br>had no equal on earth for energy, that hero who preferred glory to life,<br>that unretiring warrior firm in truth and never fatigued with exertion,<br>was your eldest brother. Offer oblations of water unto that eldest<br>brother of yours who was born of me by the god of day. That hero was born<br>with a pair of earrings and clad in armour, and resembled Surya himself<br>in splendour! Hearing these painful words of their mother, the Pandavas<br>began to express their grief for Karna. Indeed, they became more<br>afflicted than ever. Then that tiger among men, the heroic Yudhishthira,<br>sighing like a snake, asked his mother, That Karna who was like an ocean<br>having shafts for his billows, his tall standard for his vortex, his own<br>mighty arms for a couple of huge alligators, his large car for his deep<br>lake, and the sound of his palms for his tempestuous roar, and whose<br>impetuosity none could withstand save Dhananjaya, O mother, wert thou the<br>authoress of that heroic being? How was that son, resembling a very<br>celestial, born of thee in former days? The energy of his arms scorched<br>all of us. How, mother, couldst thou conceal him like a person concealing<br>a fire within the folds of his cloth? His might of arms was always<br>worshipped by the Dhartarashtras even as we always worship the might of<br>the wielder of gandiva! How was that foremost of mighty men, that first<br>of car-warriors, who endured the united force of all lords of earth in<br>battle, how was he a son of thine? Was that foremost of all wielders of<br>weapons our eldest brother? How didst thou bring forth that child of<br>wonderful prowess? Alas, in consequence of the concealment of this affair<br>by thee, we have been undone! By the death of Karna, ourselves with all<br>our friends have been exceedingly afflicted. The grief I feel at Karnas<br>death is a hundred times greater than that which was caused by the death<br>of Abhimanyu and the sons of Draupadi, and the destruction of the<br>Pancalas and the Kurus. Thinking of Karna, I am burning with grief, like<br>a person thrown into a blazing fire. Nothing could have been unattainable<br>by us, not excepting things belonging to heaven. Alas, this terrible<br>carnage, so destructive of the Kurus, would not have occurred. Copiously<br>indulging in lamentations like these, king Yudhishthira the just uttered<br>loud wails of woe. The puissant monarch then offered oblations of water<br>unto his deceased elder brother. Then all the ladies that crowded the<br>shores of the river suddenly sent up a loud wail of grief. The<br>intelligent king of the Kurus, Yudhishthira, caused the wives and members<br>of Karnas family to be brought before him. Of righteous soul, he<br>performed, with them, the water-rite in honour of his eldest brother.<br>Having finished the ceremony, the king with his senses exceedingly<br>agitated, rose from the waters of Ganga."<br><br>The end of Stri-parv
