                            "Gandhari said, There, O Madhava, my son Vikarna, applauded by the wise,<br>lieth on the bare ground, slain by Bhima and mangled horribly! Deprived<br>of life, O slayer of Madhu, Vikarna lieth in the midst of (slain)<br>elephants like the moon in the autumnal sky surrounded by blue clouds.<br>His broad palm, cased in leathern fence, and scarred by constant wielding<br>of the bow, is pierced with difficulty by vultures desirous of feeding<br>upon it. His helpless young wife, O Madhava, is continually endeavouring,<br>without success, to drive away those vultures desirous of feeding on<br>carrion. The youthful and brave and handsome Vikarna, O bull among men,<br>brought up in luxury and deserving of every kind of weal, now sleepeth<br>amid the dust, O Madhava! Though all his vital parts have been pierced<br>with clothyard shafts and bearded arrows and nalikas, yet that beauty of<br>person which was his hath not forsaken this best of the Bharatas. There,<br>my son Durmukha, that slayer of large band of foes, sleepeth, with face<br>towards the enemy, slain by the heroic Bhimasena in observance of his<br>vow. His face, O Krishna, half-eaten away by beasts of prey, looketh more<br>handsome, O child, even like the moon on the seventh day of the lighted<br>fortnight. Behold, O Krishna, the face of that heroic son of mine, which<br>is even such. How could that son of mine be slain by foes and thus made<br>to eat the dust? O amiable one, how could that Durmukha, before whom no<br>foe could stand, be slain by foes, O subjugator of celestial regions!<br>Behold, O slayer of Madhu, that other son of Dhritarashtra, Citrasena,<br>slain and lying on the ground, that hero who was the model of all bowmen?<br>Those young ladies, afflicted with grief and uttering piteous cries, are<br>now sitting, with beasts of prey, around his fair form adorned with<br>wreaths and garlands. These loud wails of woe, uttered by women, and<br>these cries and roars of beasts of prey, seem exceedingly wonderful to<br>me, O Krishna! Youthful and handsome, and always waited upon and served<br>by the most beautiful ladies, my son Vivinsati, O Madhava, sleepeth<br>there, stained with dust. His armour hath been pierced with arrows. Slain<br>in the midst of the carnage, alas, the heroic Vivimshati is now<br>surrounded and waited upon by vultures! Having in battle penetrated the<br>ranks of the Pandava army, that hero now lieth on the bed of a hero,&#8212;on<br>the bed, that is, of an exalted Kshatriya! Behold, O Krishna, his very<br>beautiful face, with a smile playing on it, adorned with excellent nose<br>and fair eyebrows, and resembling the resplendent Moon himself! Formerly<br>a large number of the most beautiful ladies used to wait upon him, like<br>thousands of celestial girls upon a sporting gandharva. Who again could<br>endure my son Duhsaha, that slayer of heroic foes, that hero, that<br>ornament of assemblies, that irresistible warrior, that resister of foes?<br>The body of Duhsaha, covered with arrows, looks resplendent like a<br>mountain overgrown with flowering karnikaras. With his garland of gold<br>and his bright armour, Duhsaha, though deprived of life, looks<br>resplendent yet, like a white mountain of fire!"
