                            "Gandhari said, He whose might and courage were regarded, O Keshava, as a<br>one and half times superior to those of his sire and thee, he who<br>resembled a fierce and proud lion, he who, without a follower, alone<br>pierced the impenetrable array of my son, he who proved to be the death<br>of many, alas, he now sleepeth there, having himself succumbed to death!<br>I see, O Krishna, the splendour of that son of Arjuna, of that hero of<br>immeasurable energy, Abhimanyu, hath not been dimmed even in death.<br>There, the daughter of Virata, the daughter-in-law of the wielder of<br>gandiva, that girl of faultless beauty overwhelmed with grief at sight of<br>her heroic husband, is indulging in lamentations! That young wife, the<br>daughter of Virata, approaching her lord, is gently rubbing him, O<br>Krishna, with her hand. Formerly, that highly intelligent and exceedingly<br>beautiful girl, inebriated with honeyed wines, used bashfully to embrace<br>her lord, and kiss the face of Subhadras son, that face which resembled a<br>full-blown lotus and which was supported on a neck adorned with three<br>lines like those of a conch-shell. Taking of her lords golden coat of<br>mail, O hero, that damsel is gazing now on the blood-dyed body of her<br>spouse. Beholding her lord, O Krishna, that girl addresses thee and says,<br>"O lotus-eyed one, this hero whose eyes resembled thine, hath been slain.<br>In might and energy, and prowess also, he was thy equal, O sinless one!<br>He resembled thee very much in beauty. Yet he sleeps on the ground, slain<br>by the enemy!" Addressing her own lord, the damsel says again, "Thou wert<br>brought up in every luxury. Thou usedst to sleep on soft skins of the<br>ranku deer. Alas, does not thy body feel pain today by lying thus on the<br>bare ground? Stretching thy massive arms adorned with golden angadas,<br>resembling a couple of elephants trunks and covered with skin hardened by<br>frequent use of the bow, thou sleepest, O lord, in peace, as if exhausted<br>with the toil of too much exercise in the gymnasium. Alas, why dost thou<br>not address me that am weeping so? I do not remember to have ever<br>offended thee. Why dost thou not speak to me then? Formerly, thou usedst<br>to address me even when thou wouldst see me at a distance. O reverend<br>sir, whither wilt thou go, leaving behind thee the much-respected<br>Subhadra, these thy sires that resemble the very celestials, and my own<br>wretched self distracted with woe?" Behold, O Krishna, gathering with her<br>hands the blood-dyed locks of her lord and placing his head on her lap,<br>the beautiful damsel is speaking to him as if he were alive, "How couldst<br>those great car-warriors slay thee in the midst of battle,&#8212;thee that art<br>the sisters son of Vasudeva and the son of the wielder of gandiva? Alas,<br>fie on those warriors of wicked deeds, Kripa and Karna and Jayadratha and<br>Drona and Dronas son, by whom thou wert deprived of life. What was the<br>state of mind of those great car-warriors at that time when they<br>surrounded thee, a warrior of tender years, and slew thee to my grief?<br>How couldst thou, O hero, who had so many protectors, be slain so<br>helplessly in the very sight of the Pandavas and the Pancalas? Beholding<br>thee, O hero, slain in battle by many persons united together, how is<br>that tiger among men, that son of Pandu, thy sire, able to bear the<br>burden of life? Neither the acquisition of a vast kingdom nor the defeat<br>of their foes conduces to the joy of the Parthas bereft of thee, O<br>lotus-eyed one! By the practice of virtue and self-restraint, I shall<br>very soon repair to those regions of bliss which thou hast acquired by<br>the use of weapons. Protect me, O hero, when I repair to those regions.<br>When ones hour does not come, one cannot die, since, wretched that I am,<br>I still draw breath after seeing thee slain in battle. Having repaired to<br>the region of the pitris, whom else, like me, dost thou address now, O<br>tiger among men, in sweet words mingled with smiles? Without doubt, thou<br>wilt agitate the hearts of the apsaras in heaven, with thy great beauty<br>and thy soft words mingled with smiles! Having obtained the regions<br>reserved for persons of righteous deeds, thou art now united, O son of<br>Subhadra, with the apsaras! While sporting with them, recollect at times<br>my good acts towards thee. Thy union with me in this world had, it seems,<br>been ordained for only six months, for in the seventh, O hero, thou hast<br>been bereft of life!" O Krishna, the ladies of the royal house of Matsya<br>are dragging away the afflicted Uttara, baffled of all her purposes,<br>while lamenting in this strain. Those ladies, dragging away the afflicted<br>Uttara, themselves still more afflicted than that girl, are weeping and<br>uttering loud wails at sight of the slain Virata. Mangled with the<br>weapons and shafts of Drona, prostrate on the ground, and covered with<br>blood, Virata is encompassed by screaming vultures and howling jackals<br>and crowing ravens. Those black-eyed ladies, approaching the prostrate<br>form of the Matsya king over which carnivorous birds are uttering cries<br>of joy, are endeavouring to turn the body. Weakened by grief and<br>exceedingly afflicted, they are unable to do what they intend. Scorched<br>by the Sun, and worn out with exertion and toil, their faces have become<br>colourless and pale. Behold also, O Madhava, those other children besides<br>Abhimanyu&#8212;Uttara, Sudakshina the prince of the Kambhojas, and the<br>handsome Lakshmana&#8212;all lying on the field of battle!"
