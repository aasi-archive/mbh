                            (Jalapradanika-parva)<br><br>Om! Having bowed down unto Narayana and Nara, the foremost of male<br>beings, and unto the goddess Sarasvati, must the word Jaya be uttered.<br><br>Janamejaya said, "After Duryodhana had fallen and after all the warriors<br>also had fallen, what, O sage, did king Dhritarashtra do on receipt of<br>the intelligence? What also did the high-souled Kuru king Yudhishthira,<br>the son of Dharma, do? What did the three survivors (of the Kuru army)<br>viz. Kripa and the others do? I have heard everything about the feats of<br>Ashvatthama. Tell me what happened after that mutual denunciation of<br>curses. Tell me all that Sanjaya said unto the blind old king."<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "After he had lost his century of sons, king<br>Dhritarashtra, afflicted with grief on that account, cheerless, and<br>looking like a tree shorn of its branches, became overwhelmed with<br>anxiety and lost his power of speech. Possessed of great wisdom, Sanjaya,<br>approaching the monarch, addressed him, saying, Why dost thou grieve, O<br>monarch? Grief does not serve any purpose. Eight and ten Akshauhinis of<br>combatants, O king, have been slain! The earth hath become desolate, and<br>is almost empty now! Kings of diverse realms, hailing from diverse<br>quarters, united with thy son (for aiding him in battle) have all laid<br>down their lives. Let now the obsequial rites of thy sires and sons and<br>grandsons and kinsmen and friends and preceptors be performed in due<br>order."<br><br>Vaishampayana continued, "Destitute of sons and counsellors and all his<br>friends, king Dhritarashtra of great energy suddenly fell down on the<br>earth like a tree uprooted by the wind.<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, Destitute as I am of sons and counsellors and all my<br>friends, I shall, without doubt have to wander in sorrow over the earth.<br>What need have I now of life itself, left as I am of kinsmen and friends<br>and resembling as I do a bird shorn of its wings and afflicted with<br>decrepitude? Shorn of kingdom, deprived of kinsmen, and destitute of<br>eyes, I cannot, O thou of great wisdom, shine any longer on earth like a<br>luminary shorn of its splendours! I did not follow the counsels of<br>friends of Jamadagnis son, of the celestial rishi Narada, and of<br>island-born Krishna, while they offered me counsel. In the midst of the<br>assembly, Krishna told me what was for my good, saying, "A truce (tense)<br>to hostilities, O king! Let thy son take the whole kingdom! Give but five<br>villages to the Pandavas!" Fool that I was, for not following that<br>advice, I am now obliged to repent so poignantly! I did not listen to the<br>righteous counsels of Bhishma. Alas, having heard of the slaughter of<br>Duryodhana whose roars were as deep as those of a bull, having heard also<br>of the death of Duhshasana and the extinction of Karna and the setting of<br>the Drona-sun, my heart does not break into pieces. I do not, O Sanjaya,<br>remember any evil act committed by me in former days, whose consequences,<br>fool that I am, I am suffering today. Without doubt, I committed great<br>sins in my former lives, for which the Supreme Ordainer has set me to<br>endure such a measure of grief. This destruction of all my kinsmen, this<br>extermination of all my well-wishers and friends, at this old age, has<br>come upon me through the force of Destiny. What other man is there on<br>earth who is more afflicted than my wretched self? Since it is so, let<br>the Pandavas behold me this very day firmly resolved to betake myself to<br>the long way that leads to the regions of Brahman!"<br><br>Vaishampayana continued, "While king Dhritarashtra was indulging in such<br>lamentations, Sanjaya addressed him in the following words for dispelling<br>his grief, Cast off thy grief, O monarch! Thou hast heard the conclusions<br>of the Vedas and the contents of diverse scriptures and holy writ, from<br>the lips of the old, O king! Thou hast heard those words which the sages<br>said unto Sanjaya while the latter was afflicted with grief on account of<br>the death of his son. When thy son, O monarch, caught the pride that is<br>born of youth, thou didst not accept the counsels offered unto thee by<br>thy well-wishers. Desirous of fruit, thou didst not, through<br>covetousness, do what was really for thy benefit. Thy own intelligence,<br>like a sharp sword, has wounded thee. Thou didst generally pay court to<br>those that were of wicked behaviour. Thy son had Duhshasana for his<br>counsellor, and the wicked-souled son of Radha, and the equally wicked<br>Shakuni and Citrasena of foolish understanding, and Salya. Thy son (by<br>his own behaviour) made the whole world his enemy. Thy son, O Bharata,<br>did not obey the words of Bhishma, the reverend chief of the Kurus, of<br>Gandhari and Vidura, of Drona, O king, of Kripa the son of Sharadvata, of<br>the mighty-armed Krishna, of the intelligent Narada, of many other<br>rishis, and of Vyasa himself of immeasurable energy. Though possessed of<br>prowess, thy son was of little intelligence, proud, always desirous of<br>battle, wicked, ungovernable, and discontented. Thou art possessed of<br>learning and intelligence and art always truthful. They that are so<br>righteous and possessed of such intelligence as thou, are never stupefied<br>by grief. Virtue was regarded by none of them. Battle was the one word on<br>their lips. For this the Kshatriya order has been exterminated and the<br>fame of thy foes enhanced. Thou hadst occupied the position of an umpire,<br>but thou didst not utter one word of salutary advise. Unfitted as thou<br>wert for the task, thou didst not hold the scales evenly. Every person<br>should, at the outset, adopt such a beneficial line of action that he may<br>not have, in the end, to repent for something already done by him.<br>Through affection for thy son, O monarch, thou didst what was agreeable<br>to Duryodhana. Thou art obliged to repent for that now. It behoveth thee,<br>however not to give way to grief. The man whose eyes are directed towards<br>only the honey without being once directed to the fall, meets with<br>destruction through his covetousness for honey. Such a man is obliged to<br>repent even like thee. The man who indulges in grief never wins wealth.<br>By grieving one loses the fruits one desires. Grief is again an obstacle<br>to the acquisition of objects dear to us. The man who gives way to grief<br>loses even his salvation. The man who shrouds a burning coal within the<br>folds of his attire and is burnt by the fire that is kindled by it, would<br>be pronounced a fool if he grieves for his injuries. Thyself, with thy<br>son, hadst, with your words, fanned the Partha-fire, and with your<br>covetousness acting as clarified butter caused that fire to blaze forth,<br>into consuming flames. When that fire thus blazed forth thy sons fell<br>into it like insects. It behoveth thee not, however, to grieve for them<br>now that they have all been burnt in the fire of the enemys arrow. The<br>tear-stained face, O king, which thou bearest now is not approved by the<br>scriptures or praised by the wise. These tears, like sparks of fire, burn<br>the dead for whom they are shed. Kill thy grief with thy intelligence,<br>and bear thyself up with the strength of thy own self! Thus was the king<br>comforted by the high-souled Sanjaya. Vidura then, O scorcher of foes,<br>once again addressed the king, displaying great intelligence."
