                            "Gandhari said, Behold, O Madhava, my century of sons, incapable of<br>fatigue (from exertion in battle), have all been slain by Bhimasena with<br>his mace in battle! That which grieves me more today is that these my<br>daughters-in-law, of tender years, deprived of sons and with dishevelled<br>hair, are wandering on the field today. Alas, they who formerly walked<br>only on the terraces of goodly mansions with feet adorned with many<br>ornaments, are now, in great affliction of heart, obliged to touch with<br>those feet of theirs this hard earth, miry with blood! Reeling in sorrow,<br>they are wandering like inebriated persons, driving away vultures and<br>jackals and crows with difficulty. Behold, that lady of faultless limbs<br>and slender waist, seeing this terrible carnage, falleth down,<br>overwhelmed with grief. Beholding this princess, this mother of<br>Lakshmana, O thou of mighty arms, my heart is torn with grief. These<br>beautiful ladies of fair arms, some seeing their brothers, some their<br>husbands, and some their sons, lying down in death on the bare ground,<br>are themselves falling down, seizing the arms of the slain. Listen, O<br>unvanquished one, to the loud wails of those elderly ladies and those<br>others of middle age at sight of this terrible carnage. Supporting<br>themselves against broken boxes of cars and the bodies of slain elephants<br>and steeds, behold, O thou of great might, those ladies, worn out with<br>fatigue, are resting themselves. Behold, O Krishna, some one amongst<br>them, taking up some kinsmans severed head decked with beautiful nose and<br>earrings, is standing in grief. I think, O sinless one, that both those<br>and myself of little understanding must have committed great sins in our<br>former lives, since, O Janardana, all our relatives and kinsmen have thus<br>been slain by king Yudhishthira the just! Our acts, righteous or<br>unrighteous, cannot go for nothing, O thou of Vrishnis race! Behold, O<br>Madhava, those young ladies of beautiful bosoms and abdomen, well-born,<br>possessed of modesty, having black eye-lashes and tresses of the same<br>colour on their heads, endued with voice sweet and dear like that of<br>swans, are falling down, deprived of their senses in great grief and<br>uttering piteous cries like flights of cranes. Behold, O lotus-eyed hero,<br>their beautiful faces resembling full-blown lotuses, are scorched by the<br>sun. Alas, O Vasudeva, the wives of my proud children possessed of<br>prowess like that of infuriated elephants, are now exposed to the gaze of<br>common people. Behold, O Govinda, the shields decked with hundred moons,<br>the standards of solar effulgence, the golden coats of mail, and the<br>collars and cuirasses made of gold, and the head-gears, of my sons,<br>scattered on the earth, are blazing with splendour like sacrificial fires<br>over which have been poured libations, of clarified butter. There,<br>Duhshasana sleepeth, felled by Bhima, and the blood of all his limbs<br>quaffed by that heroic slayer of foes. Behold that other son of mine, O<br>Madhava, slain by Bhima with his mace, impelled by Draupadi and the<br>recollection of his woes at the time of the match at dice. Addressing the<br>dice-won princess of Pancala in the midst of the assembly, this<br>Duhshasana, desirous of doing what was agreeable to his (elder) brother<br>as also to Karna, O Janardana, had said, "Thou art now the wife of a<br>slave! With Sahadeva and Nakula and Arjuna, O lady, enter our household<br>now!" On that occasion, O Krishna, I said unto king Duryodhana, "O son,<br>cast off (from thy side) the wrathful Shakuni. Know that thy maternal<br>uncle is of very wicked soul and exceedingly fond of quarrel. Casting him<br>off without delay, make peace with the Pandavas, O son! O thou of little<br>intelligence, thinkest thou not of Bhimasena filled with wrath? Thou art<br>piercing him with thy wordy shafts like a person striking an elephant<br>with burning brands." Alas, disregarding my words, he vomitted his wordy<br>poison at them, like a snake vomitting its poison at a bull,&#8212;at them who<br>had already been pierced with his wordy darts. There, that Duhshasana<br>sleepeth, stretching his two massive arms, slain by Bhimasena like a<br>mighty elephant by a lion. The very wrathful Bhimasena perpetrated a most<br>horrible act by drinking in battle the blood of his foe!"
