                            "Gandhari said, There lies Shalya, the maternal uncle himself of Nakula,<br>slain in battle, O sire, by the pious and virtuous Yudhishthira! He used<br>everywhere, O bull among men, to boast of his equality with thee! That<br>mighty car-warrior, the ruler of the Madras, now lieth, deprived of life.<br>When he accepted the drivership of Karnas car in battle, he sought to<br>damp the energy of Karna for giving victory to the sons of Pandu! Alas,<br>alas, behold the smooth face of Shalya, beautiful as the moon, and<br>adorned with eyes resembling the petals of the lotus, eaten away by<br>crows! There, the tongue of that king, of the complexion of heated gold,<br>rolling out of his mouth, is, O Krishna, being eaten away by carnivorous<br>birds! The ladies of the royal house of Madra, uttering loud wails of<br>woe, are sitting around the body of that king, that ornament of<br>assemblies, deprived of life by Yudhishthira! Those ladies are sitting<br>around that fallen hero like a herd of she-elephants in their season<br>around their leader sunk in a slough. Behold the brave Shalya, that giver<br>of protection, that foremost of car-warriors, stretched on the bed of<br>heroes, his body mangled with shafts. There, king Bhagadatta of great<br>prowess, the ruler of a mountainous kingdom, the foremost of all wielders<br>of the elephant-hook, lieth on the ground, deprived of life. Behold the<br>garland of gold that he still wears on his head, looketh resplendent.<br>Though the body is being eaten away by beasts of prey, that garland still<br>adorns the fair locks on his head. Fierce was the battle that took place<br>between this king and Partha, making the very hair stand on end, like<br>that between Shakra and the Asura Vritra. This mighty-armed one, having<br>fought Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, and having reduced him to great<br>straits, was at last slain by his antagonist. He who had no equal on<br>earth in heroism and energy, that achiever of terrible feats in battle,<br>Bhishma, lieth there, deprived of life. Behold the son of Shantanu, O<br>Krishna, that warrior of solar effulgence, stretched on the earth, like<br>the Sun himself fallen from the firmament at the end of the yuga. Having<br>scorched his foes with the fire of his weapons in battle, that valiant<br>warrior, that Sun among men, O Keshava, hath set like the real Sun at<br>evening. Behold that hero, O Krishna, who in knowledge of duty was equal<br>to Devapi himself, now lying on a bed of arrows, so worthy of heroes.<br>Having spread his excellent bed of barbed and unbarbed arrows, that hero<br>lieth on it like the divine Skanda on a clump of heath. Indeed, the son<br>of Ganga lieth, resting his head on that excellent pillow, consisting of<br>three arrows,&#8212;becoming complement of his bed&#8212;given him by the wielder<br>of gandiva. For obeying the command of his sire, this illustrious one<br>drew up his vital seed. Unrivalled in battle, that son of Shantanu lieth<br>there, O Madhava! Of righteous soul and acquainted with every duty, by<br>the aid of his knowledge relating to both the worlds, that hero, though<br>mortal, is still bearing his life like an immortal. When Shantanus son<br>lieth today, struck down with arrows, it seems that no other person is<br>alive on earth that possesseth learning and prowess that is competent to<br>achieve great feats in battle. Truthful in speech, this righteous and<br>virtuous hero, solicited by the Pandavas, told them the means of his own<br>death. Alas, he who had revived the line of Kuru that had become extinct,<br>that illustrious person possessed of great intelligence, hath left the<br>world with all the Kurus in his company. Of whom, O Madhava, will the<br>Kurus enquire of religion and duty after that bull among men, Devavrata,<br>who resembles a god, shall have gone to heaven? Behold Drona, that<br>foremost of brahmanas, that preceptor of Arjuna, of Satyaki, and of the<br>Kurus, lying on the ground! Endued with mighty energy, Drona, O Madhava,<br>was as conversant with the four kinds of arms as the chief of the<br>celestials or Shukra of Bhrigus race. Through his grace, Vibhatsu the son<br>of Pandu, hath achieved the most difficult feats. Deprived of life, he<br>now lies on the ground. Weapons refused to come (at last) at his bidding.<br>Placing him at their head, the Kauravas had challenged the Pandavas. That<br>foremost of all wielders of weapons was at last mangled with weapons. As<br>he careered in battle, scorching his foes in every direction, his course<br>resembled that of a blazing conflagration. Alas, deprived of life, he now<br>lieth on the ground, like an extinguished fire. The handle of the bow is<br>yet in his grasp. The leathern fences, O Madhava, still encase his<br>fingers. Though slain, he still looketh as if alive. The four Vedas, and<br>all kinds of weapons, O Keshava, did not abandon that hero even as these<br>do not abandon the Lord Prajapati himself. His auspicious feet, deserving<br>of every adoration and adored as a matter of fact by bards and eulogists<br>and worshipped by disciples, are now being dragged by jackals. Deprived<br>of her senses by grief, Kripi woefully attendeth, O slayer of Madhu, on<br>that Drona who hath been slain Drupadas son. Behold that afflicted lady,<br>fallen upon the Earth, with dishevelled hair and face hanging down. Alas,<br>she attendeth in sorrow upon her lifeless lord, that foremost of all<br>wielders of weapons, lying on the ground. Many brahmacaris, with matted<br>locks on their head, are attending upon the body of Drona that is cased<br>in armour rent through and through, O Keshava, with the shafts of<br>Dhrishtadyumna. The illustrious and delicate Kripi, cheerless and<br>afflicted, is endeavouring to perform the last rites on the body of her<br>lord slain in battle. There, those reciters of Samas, having placed the<br>body of Drona on the funeral pyre and having ignited the fire with due<br>rites, are singing the three (well-known) Samas. Those brahmacaris, with<br>matted locks on their heads, have piled the funeral pyre of that brahmana<br>with bows and darts and car-boxes, O Madhava! Having collected diverse<br>other kinds of shafts, that hero of great energy is being consumed by<br>them. Indeed, having placed him on the pyre, they are singing and<br>weeping. Others are reciting the three (well-known) Samas that are used<br>on such occasions. Consuming Drona on that fire, like fire in fire, those<br>disciples of his of the regenerate class are proceeding towards the banks<br>of the Ganga, along the left side of the pyre and having placed Kripi at<br>their head!"
