                            Vaishampayana said, "Listen, O Janamejaya, to the nectar-like words that<br>Vidura said unto the son of Vicitravirya and by which he gladdened that<br>bull among men!<br><br>"Vidura said, Rise, O king! Why art thou stretched on the earth? Bear<br>thyself up with thy own self. O king, even this is the final end of all<br>living creatures. Everything massed together ends in destruction;<br>everything that gets high is sure to fall down. Union is certain to end<br>in separation; life is sure to end in death. The destroyer, O Bharata,<br>drags both the hero and the coward. Why then, O bull amongst Kshatriyas,<br>should not Kshatriyas engage in battle? He that does not fight is seen to<br>escape with life. When, however, ones time comes, O king, one cannot<br>escape. As regards living creatures, they are non-existent at first. They<br>exist in the period that intervenes. In the end they once more become<br>non-existent. What matter of grief then is there in this? The man that<br>indulges in grief succeeds not in meeting with the dead. By indulging in<br>grief, one does not himself die. When the course of the world is such,<br>why dost thou indulge in sorrow? Death drags all creatures, even the<br>gods. There is none dear or hateful to death, O best of the Kurus! As the<br>wind tears off the tops of all blades of grass, even so, O bull of<br>Bharatas race, death overmasters all creatures. All creatures are like<br>members of a caravan bound for the same destination. (When death will<br>encounter all) it matters very little whom he meets with first. It<br>behoveth thee not, O king, to grieve for those that have been slain in<br>battle. If the scriptures are any authority, all of them must have<br>obtained the highest end. All of them were versed in the Vedas; all of<br>them had observed vows. Facing the foe all of them have met with death.<br>What matter of sorrow is there in this? Invisible they had been (before<br>birth). Having come from that unknown region, they have once more become<br>invisible. They are not thine, nor art thou theirs. What grief then is<br>there in such disappearance? If slain, one wins heaven. By slaying, fame<br>is won. Both these, with respect to us, are productive of great merit.<br>Battle, therefore, is not bootless. No doubt, Indra will contrive for<br>them regions capable of granting every wish. These, O bull among men,<br>become the guests of Indra. Men cannot, by sacrifices with profuse gifts,<br>by ascetic penances and by learning, go so speedily to heaven as heroes<br>slain in battle. On the bodies of hostile heroes constituting the<br>sacrificial fire, they poured their arrowy libations. Possessed of great<br>energy, they had in return to endure the arrowy libations (poured upon<br>them by their enemies). I tell thee, O king, that for a Kshatriya in this<br>world there is not a better road to heaven than battle! They were all<br>high-souled Kshatriyas; possessed of bravery, they were ornaments of<br>assemblies. They have attained to a high state of blessedness. They are<br>not persons for whom we should grieve. Comforting thyself by thy own self<br>cease to grieve, O bull among men! It behoveth thee not to suffer thyself<br>to be overwhelmed with sorrow and to abandon all actions. There are<br>thousands of mothers and fathers and sons and wives in this world. Whose<br>are they, and whose are we? From day to day thousands of causes spring up<br>for sorrow and thousands of causes for fear. These, however, affect the<br>ignorant but are nothing to him that is wise. There is none dear or<br>hateful to Time, O best of the Kurus! Time is indifferent to none. All<br>are equally dragged by Time. Time causeth all creatures to grow, and it<br>is Time that destroyeth everything. When all else is asleep, Time is<br>awake. Time is irresistible. Youth, beauty, life, possessions, health,<br>and the companionship of friends, all are unstable. He that is wise will<br>never covet any of these. It behoveth thee not to grieve for what is<br>universal. A person may, by indulging in grief, himself perish, but grief<br>itself, by being indulged in, never becomes light. Ifthou feelest thy<br>grief to be heavy, it should be counteracted by not indulging in it. Even<br>this is the medicine for grief, viz., that one should not indulge in it.<br>By dwelling on it, one cannot lessen it. On the other hand, it grows with<br>indulgence. Upon the advent of evil or upon the bereavement of something<br>that is dear, only they that are of little intelligence suffer their<br>minds to be afflicted with grief. This is neither Profit, nor Religion,<br>nor Happiness, on which thy heart is dwelling. The indulgence of grief is<br>the certain means of ones losing ones objects. Through it, one falls away<br>from the three great ends of life (religion, profit, and pleasure). They<br>that are destitute of contentment, are stupefied on the accession of<br>vicissitudes dependent upon the possession of wealth. They, however, that<br>are wise, are on the other hand, unaffected by such vicissitudes. One<br>should kill mental grief by wisdom, just as physical grief should be<br>killed by medicine. Wisdom hath this power. They, however, that are<br>foolish, can never obtain tranquillity of soul. The acts of a former life<br>closely follow a man, insomuch that they lie by him when he lies down,<br>stay by him when he stays, and run with him when he runs. In those<br>conditions of life in which one acts well or ill, one enjoys or suffers<br>the fruit thereof in similar conditions. In those forms (of physical<br>organisation) in which one performs particular acts, one enjoys or<br>suffers the fruits thereof in similar forms. Ones own self is ones own<br>friend, as, indeed, ones own self is ones own enemy. Ones own self is the<br>witness of ones acts, good and evil. From good acts springs a state of<br>happiness, from sinful deeds springs woe. One always obtains the fruit of<br>ones acts. One never enjoys or suffers weal or woe that is not the fruit<br>of ones own acts. Intelligent persons like thee, O king, never sink in<br>sinful enormities that are disapproved by knowledge and that strike at<br>the very root (of virtue and happiness)."
