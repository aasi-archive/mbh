                            Vaishampayana said, "Hearing these words of Gandhari, Bhimasena, looking<br>like one in fright, said these words for soothing her, Be the act<br>righteous or unrighteous, it was done by me through fear and for the<br>object of protecting my own self. It behoveth thee therefore, to forgive<br>me now. Thy mighty son was incapable of being slain by anybody in a fair<br>and righteous battle. It was for this that I did what was unfair.<br>Duryodhana himself had formerly vanquished Yudhishthira unrighteously. He<br>used always to behave guilefully towards us. It was for this that I had<br>recourse to an unfair act. Thy son was then the sole unslain warrior on<br>his side. In order that that valiant prince might not slay me in the<br>mace-encounter and once more deprive us of our kingdom, I acted in that<br>way. Thou knowest all that thy son had said unto the princess of Pancala<br>while the latter, in her season, was clad in a single piece of raiment.<br>Without having disposed of Suyodhana it was impossible for us to rule<br>peacefully the whole earth with her seas. It was for this that I acted in<br>that way. Thy son inflicted many wrongs on us. In the midst of the<br>assembly he had shown his left thigh unto Draupadi. For that wicked<br>behaviour, thy son deserved to be slain by us even then. At the command,<br>however, of king Yudhishthira the just, we suffered ourselves to be<br>restrained by the compact that had been made. By this means, O queen, thy<br>son provoked deadly hostilities with us. Great were our sufferings in the<br>forest (whither we were driven by thy son). Remembering all this, I acted<br>in that way. Having slain Duryodhana in battle, we have reached the end<br>of our hostilities. Yudhishthira has got back his kingdom, and we also<br>have been freed from wrath. Hearing these words of Bhima, Gandhari said,<br>Since thou praisest my son thus (for his skill in battle), he did not<br>deserve such a death. He, however, did all that thou tellest me. When<br>Vrishasena, however, had deprived Nakula of his steeds, O Bharata, thou<br>quaffedst in battle the blood from Duhshasanas body! Such an act is cruel<br>and is censured by the good. It suits only a person that is most<br>disrespectable. It was a wicked act, O Vrikodara, that was then<br>accomplished by thee! It was undeserving of thee. Bhima replied, saying,<br>It is improper to quaff the blood of even a stranger, what then need be<br>said about quaffing the blood of ones own self? Ones brother, again, is<br>like ones own self. There is no difference between them. The blood,<br>however, (that I am regarded to have quaffed) did not, O mother, pass<br>down my lips and teeth. Karna knew this well. My hands only were smeared<br>with (Duhshasanas) blood. Seeing Nakula deprived of his steeds by<br>Vrishasena in battle, I caused the rejoicing (Kaurava) brothers to be<br>filled with dread. When after the match at dice the tresses of Draupadi<br>were seized, I uttered certain words in rage. Those words are still in my<br>remembrance, I would, for all years to come, have been regarded to have<br>swerved from the duties of a Kshatriya if I had left that vow<br>unaccomplished. It was for this, O queen, that I did that act. It<br>behoveth thee not, O Gandhari, to impute any fault to me. Without having<br>restrained thy sons in former days, doth it behove thee to impute any<br>fault to our innocent selves?<br><br>"Gandhari said, Unvanquished by anyone, thou hast slain a hundred sons of<br>this old man. Oh, why didst thou not spare, O child, even one son of this<br>old couple deprived of kingdom, one whose offences were lighter? Why<br>didst thou not leave even one crutch for this blind couple? O child,<br>although thou livest unharmed, having slain all my children, yet no grief<br>would have been mine if thou hadst adopted the path of righteousness (in<br>slaying them)."<br><br>Vaishampayana continued, "Having said these words, Gandhari, filled with<br>wrath at the slaughter of all her sons and grandsons, enquired after<br>Yudhishthira, saying, Where is the king? After she had said these words<br>king Yudhishthira, trembling and with joined hands, approached her and<br>said these soft words unto her, Here is Yudhishthira, O goddess, that<br>cruel slayer of thy sons! I deserve thy curses, for I am the cause of<br>this universal destruction. Oh, curse me! I have no longer any need for<br>life, for kingdom, for wealth! Having caused such friends to be slain, I<br>have proved myself to be a great fool and a hater of friends. Unto<br>Yudhishthira who spoke such words, who was overcome with fear, and who<br>stood in her presence, Gandhari, drawing long sighs, said nothing.<br>Conversant with the rules of righteousness, the Kuru queen, possessed of<br>great foresight, directed her eyes, from within the folds of the cloth<br>that covered them, to the tip of Yudhishthiras toe, as the prince, with<br>body bent forwards, was about to fall down at her feet. At this, the<br>king, whose nails had before this been all very beautiful, came to have a<br>sore nail on his toe. Beholding this, Arjuna moved away to the rear of<br>Vasudeva. and the other sons of Pandu became restless and moved from one<br>spot to another. Gandhari then, having cast off her wrath, comforted the<br>Pandavas as a mother should. Obtaining her leave, those heroes of broad<br>chests then proceeded together to present themselves to their mother,<br>that parent of heroes. Having seen her sons after a long time, Kunti, who<br>had been filled with anxiety on their account, covered her face with her<br>cloth and began to weep. Having wept for some time with her children,<br>Pritha beheld the wounds and scars of many weapons on their bodies. She<br>then repeatedly embraced and patted each of her sons, and afflicted with<br>grief wept with Draupadi who had lost all her children and whom she saw<br>lying on the bare earth, indulging in piteous lamentations.<br><br>"Draupadi said, O venerable dame, where have all your grandsons, with<br>Abhimanyu among them, gone? Beholding thee in such distress, why are they<br>delaying in making their appearance before thee? Deprived as I am of my<br>children, what need have I of kingdom? Raising the grief-stricken<br>princess of Pancala who was weeping thus, Pritha began to comfort that<br>lady of large eyes. Then Kunti, accompanied by the princess of Pancala<br>and followed by her sons, proceeded towards the grief-afflicted Gandhari<br>herself in greater affliction still. Beholding that illustrious lady with<br>her daughter-in-law, Gandhari addressed her, saying, Do not, O daughter,<br>grieve so. Behold, I too am as much stricken with grief as thou. I think<br>this universal destruction has been brought about by the irresistible<br>course of Time. Inevitable as it was, this dreadful slaughter has not<br>been due to the voluntary agency of human beings. Even that has come to<br>pass which Vidura of great wisdom foretold after Krishnas supplication<br>for peace had failed. Do not, therefore, grieve, in a matter that was<br>inevitable, especially after its occurrence. Having fallen in battle,<br>they should not be grieved for. I am in the same predicament with thee.<br>(If thou actest in such a way) who then will comfort us? Through my<br>fault, this foremost of races has been destroyed."<br><br>Here ends the Jalapradanika-parva in the Stri-parva.
