                            "Dhritarashtra said, Tell me in detail everything about the ways of that<br>intelligence by which this wilderness of duties may be safely covered.<br><br>"Vidura said, Having bowed down to the Self-create, I will obey thy<br>behest by telling thee how the great sages speak of the wilderness of<br>life. A certain brahmana, living in the great world, found himself on one<br>occasion in a large inaccessible forest teeming with beasts of prey. It<br>abounded on every side with lions and other animals looking like<br>elephants, all of which were engaged in roaring aloud. Such was the<br>aspect of that forest that Yama himself would take fright at it.<br>Beholding the forest, the heart of the brahmana became exceedingly<br>agitated. His hair stood on end, and other signs of fear manifested<br>themselves, O scorcher of foes! Entering it, he began to run hither and<br>thither, casting his eyes on every point of the compass for finding out<br>somebody whose shelter he might seek. Wishing to avoid those terrible<br>creatures, he ran in fright. He could not succeed, however, in distancing<br>them or freeing himself from their presence. He then saw that that<br>terrible forest was surrounded with a net, and that a frightful woman<br>stood there, stretching her arms. That large forest was also encompassed<br>by many five-headed snakes of dreadful forms, tall as cliffs and touching<br>the very heavens. Within it was a pit whose mouth was covered with many<br>hard and unyielding creepers and herbs. The brahmana, in course of his<br>wanderings, fell into that invisible pit. He became entangled in those<br>clusters of creepers that were interwoven with one another, like the<br>large fruit of a jack tree hanging by its stalk. He continued to hang<br>there, feet upwards and head downwards. While he was in that posture,<br>diverse other calamities overtook him. He beheld a large and mighty snake<br>within the pit. He also saw a gigantic elephant near its mouth. That<br>elephant, dark in complexion, had six faces and twelve feet. And the<br>animal gradually approached that pit covered with creepers and trees.<br>About the twigs of the tree (that stood at the mouth of the pit), roved<br>many bees of frightful forms, employed from before in drinking the honey<br>gathered in their comb about which they swarmed in large numbers.<br>Repeatedly they desired, O bull of Bharatas race, to taste that honey<br>which though sweet to all creatures could, however, attract children<br>only. The honey (collected in the comb) fell in many jets below. The<br>person who was hanging in the pit continually drank those jets. Employed,<br>in such a distressful situation, in drinking that honey, his thirst,<br>however, could not be appeased. Unsatiated with repeated draughts, the<br>person desired for more. Even then, O king, he did not become indifferent<br>to life. Even there, the man continued to hope for existence. A number of<br>black and white rats were eating away the roots of that tree. There was<br>fear from the beasts of prey, from that fierce woman on the outskirts of<br>that forest, from that snake at the bottom of the well, from that<br>elephant near its top, from the fall of the tree through the action of<br>the rats, and lastly from those bees flying about for tasting the honey.<br>In that plight he continued to dwell, deprived of his senses, in that<br>wilderness, never losing at any time the hope of prolonging his life."
