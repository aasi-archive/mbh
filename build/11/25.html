                            "Gandhari said, Behold that irresistible ruler of the Kambojas, that<br>bull-necked hero, lying amid the dust, O Madhava, though deserving of<br>being stretched at his ease on Kamboja blankets. Stricken with great<br>grief, his wife is weeping bitterly at sight of his blood-stained arms,<br>which, however, formerly used to be smeared with sandal-paste. Indeed,<br>the beauteous one exclaims, "Even now adorned with beautiful palms and<br>graceful fingers, these two arms of thine resemble a couple of spiked<br>maces, getting within whose clasp, joy never left me for a moment! What<br>will be my end, O ruler of men, when I am deprived of thee?" Endued with<br>a melodious voice, the Kamboja queen is weeping helplessly and quivering<br>with emotion. Behold that bevy of fair ladies there. Although tired with<br>exertion and worn out with heat, yet beauty leaves not their forms, like<br>the sightliness of the wreaths worn by the celestials although exposed to<br>the Sun. Behold, O slayer of Madhu, the heroic ruler of the Kalingas<br>lying there on the ground with his mighty arms adorned with a couple of<br>angadas. Behold, O Janardana, those Magadha ladies crying and standing<br>around Jayatsena, the ruler of the Magadhas. The charming and melodious<br>wails of those long-eyed and sweet-voiced girls, O Krishna, are<br>stupefying my heart exceedingly. With all their ornaments displaced,<br>crying, and afflicted with grief, alas, those ladies of Magadha, worthy<br>of resting on costly beds, are now lying down on the bare ground! There,<br>again, those other ladies, surrounding their lord, the ruler of the<br>Kosalas, prince Brihadbala, are indulging in loud wails. Engaged in<br>plucking from his body the shafts with which it was pierced by Abhimanyu<br>with the full might of his arms, those ladies are repeatedly losing their<br>senses. The faces of those beautiful ladies, O Madhava, through toil and<br>the rays of the Sun, are looking like faded lotuses. There, the brave<br>sons of Dhrishtadyumna, of tender years and all adorned with garlands of<br>gold and beautiful angadas, are lying, slain by Drona. Like insects on a<br>blazing fire, they have all been burnt by falling upon Drona, whose car<br>was the chamber of fire, having the bow for its flame and shafts and<br>darts and maces for its fuel. Similarly, the five Kekaya brothers,<br>possessed of great courage, and adorned with beautiful angadas, are lying<br>on the ground, slain by Drona and with their faces turned towards that<br>hero. Their coats of mail, of the splendour of heated gold, and their<br>tall standards and cars and garlands, all made of the same metal, are<br>shedding a bright light on the earth like so many blazing fires. Behold,<br>O Madhava, king Drupada overthrown in battle by Drona, like a mighty<br>elephant in the forest slain by a huge lion. The bright umbrella, white<br>in hue of the king of the Pancalas, shines, O lotus-eyed one, like the<br>moon in the autumnal firmament. The daughters-in-law and the wives of the<br>old king, afflicted with grief, having burnt his body on the funeral<br>pyre, are proceeding, keeping the pyre to their right. There those<br>ladies, deprived of their senses, are removing the brave and great bowman<br>Dhrishtaketu, that bull among the Cedis, slain by Drona. This crusher of<br>foes, O slayer of Madhu, this great bowman, having baffled many weapons<br>of Drona, lieth there, deprived of life, like a tree uprooted by the<br>wind. Alas, that brave ruler of the Cedis, that mighty car-warrior<br>Dhrishtaketu, after having slain thousands of foes, lies himself deprived<br>of life! There, O Hrishikesha, the wives of the ruler of the Cedis are<br>sitting around his body still decked with fair locks and beautiful<br>earrings, though torn by carnivorous birds. Those foremost of ladies<br>placing upon their laps the prostrate form of the heroic Dhrishtaketu<br>born of the Dasharha race, are crying in sorrow. Behold, O Hrishikesha,<br>the son, possessed of fair locks and excellent earrings, of that<br>Dhrishtaketu, hacked in battle by Drona with his shafts. He never<br>deserted his sire while the latter battled with his foes. Mark, O slayer<br>of Madhu, he does not, even in death, desert that heroic parent. Even<br>thus, my sons son, that slayer of hostile heroes, the mighty-armed<br>Lakshmana, hath followed his sire Duryodhana! Behold, O Keshava, the two<br>brothers of Avanti, Vinda and Anuvinda, lying there on the field, like<br>two blossoming shala trees in the spring overthrown by the tempest. Clad<br>in golden armour and adorned with Angadas of gold, they are still armed<br>with swords and bows. Possessed of eyes like those of a bull, and decked<br>with bright garlands, both of them are stretched on the field. The<br>Pandavas, O Krishna, with thyself, are surely unslayable, since they and<br>thou have escaped from Drona, from Bhishma, from Karna the son of<br>Vikartana, from Kripa, from Duryodhana, from the son of Drona, from the<br>mighty car-warrior Jayadratha, from Somadatta, from Vikarna, and from the<br>brave Kritavarma. Behold the reverses brought about by Time! Those bulls<br>among men that were capable of slaying the very celestials by force of<br>their weapons have themselves been slain. Without doubt, O Madhava, there<br>is nothing difficult for destiny to bring about, since even these bulls<br>among men, these heroes, have been slain by Kshatriya warriors. My sons<br>endued with great activity were (regarded by me as) slain even then, O<br>Krishna, when thou returnedst unsuccessfully to Upaplavya. Shantanus son<br>and the wise Vidura told me then, "Cease to bear affection for thy<br>children!" The interviews of those persons could not go for nothing.<br>Soon, O Janardana, have my sons been consumed into ashes!"<br><br>Vaishampayana continued, "Having said these words, Gandhari, deprived of<br>her senses by grief, fell down on the earth! Casting off her fortitude,<br>she suffered her senses to be stupefied by grief. Filled with wrath and<br>with sorrow at the death of her sons, Gandhari, with agitated heart,<br>ascribed every fault to Keshava.<br><br>"Gandhari said, The Pandavas and the Dhartarashtras, O Krishna, have both<br>been burnt. Whilst they were thus being exterminated, O Janardana, why<br>wert thou indifferent to them? Thou wert competent to prevent the<br>slaughter, for thou hast a large number of followers and a vast force.<br>Thou hadst eloquence, and thou hadst the power (for bringing about<br>peace). Since deliberately, O slayer of Madhu, thou wert indifferent to<br>this universal carnage, therefore, O mighty-armed one, thou shouldst reap<br>the fruit of this act. By the little merit I have acquired through<br>waiting dutifully on my husband, by that merit so difficult to attain, I<br>shall curse thee, O wielder of the discus and the mace! Since thou wert<br>indifferent to the Kurus and the Pandavas whilst they slew each other,<br>therefore, O Govinda, thou shalt be the slayer of thy own kinsmen! In the<br>thirty-sixth year from this, O slayer of Madhu, thou shalt, after causing<br>the slaughter of thy kinsmen and friends and sons, perish by disgusting<br>means in the wilderness. The ladies of thy race, deprived of sons,<br>kinsmen, and friends, shall weep and cry even as these ladies of the<br>Bharata race!"<br><br>Vaishampayana continued, "Hearing these words, the high-souled Vasudeva,<br>addressing the venerable Gandhari, said unto her these words, with a<br>faint smile, There is none in the world, save myself, that is capable of<br>exterminating the Vrishnis. I know this well. I am endeavouring to bring<br>it about. In uttering this curse, O thou of excellent vows, thou hast<br>aided me in the accomplishment of that task. The Vrishnis are incapable<br>of being slain by others, be they human beings or gods or Danavas. The<br>Yadavas, therefore shall fall by one anothers hand. After he of Dasharhas<br>race had said these words, the Pandavas became stupefied. Filled with<br>anxiety all of them became hopeless of life!"
