                            "The holy one said, Arise, arise, O Gandhari, do not set thy heart on<br>grief! Through thy fault, this vast carnage has taken place! Thy son<br>Duryodhana was wicked-souled, envious, and exceedingly arrogant.<br>Applauding his wicked acts, thou regardest them to be good. Exceedingly<br>cruel, he was the embodiment of hostilities, and disobedient to the<br>injunctions of the old. Why dost thou wish to ascribe thy own faults to<br>me? Dead or lost, the person that grieves for what has already occurred,<br>obtaineth more grief. By indulging in grief, one increases it two-fold. A<br>woman of the regenerate class bears children for the practice of<br>austerities; the cow brings forth offspring for bearing burdens; the mare<br>brings forth her young for acquiring speed of motion; the Shudra woman<br>bears a child for adding to the number of servitors; the Vaishya woman<br>for adding to the number of keepers of cattle. A princess, however, like<br>thee, brings forth sons for being slaughtered!"<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "Hearing these words of Vasudeva that were<br>disagreeable to her, Gandhari, with heart exceedingly agitated by grief,<br>remained silent. The royal sage Dhritarashtra, however, restraining the<br>grief that arises from folly, enquired of Yudhishthira the just, saying,<br>If, O son of Pandu, thou knowest it, tell me the number of those that<br>have fallen in this battle, as also of those that have escaped with life!<br><br>"Yudhishthira answered, One billion 660 million and 20,000 men have<br>fallen in this battle. Of the heroes that have escaped, the number is<br>240,165.<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, Tell me, O mighty-armed one, for thou art conversant<br>with everything, what ends have those foremost of men attained.<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, Those warriors of true prowess that have cheerfully<br>cast off their bodies in fierce battle have all attained regions like<br>those of Indra. Knowing death to be inevitable, they that have<br>encountered it cheerlessly have attained the companionship of the<br>gandharvas. Those warriors that have fallen at the edge of weapons, while<br>turning away from the field or begging for quarter, have attained the<br>world of the guhyakas. Those high-souled warriors who, observant of the<br>duties of kshatriya-hood and regarding flight from battle to be shameful,<br>have fallen, mangled with keen weapons, while advancing unarmed against<br>fighting foes, have all assumed bright forms and attained the regions of<br>Brahman. The remaining warriors, that have in anyhow met with death on<br>the precincts of the field of battle, have attained the region of the<br>Uttara-Kurus."<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, By the power of what knowledge, O son, thou seest<br>these things like one crowned with ascetic success? Tell me this, O<br>mighty-armed one, if thou thinkest that I can listen to it without<br>impropriety!<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, While at thy command I wandered in the forest, I<br>obtained this boon on the occasion of sojourning to the sacred places. I<br>met with the celestial rishi Lomasa and obtained from him the boon of<br>spiritual vision. Thus on a former occasion I obtained second sight<br>through the power of knowledge!<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, It is necessary that our people should burn, with<br>due rites, the bodies of both the friendless and the friended slain. What<br>shall we do with those that have none to look after them and that have no<br>sacred fires? The duties that await us are many. Who are those whose<br>(last) rites we should perform? O Yudhishthira, will they obtain regions<br>of blessedness by the merit of their acts, they whose bodies are now<br>being torn and dragged by vultures and other birds?"<br><br>Vaishampayana continued, "Thus addressed, Kuntis son Yudhishthira of<br>great wisdom commanded Sudharma (the priest of the Kauravas) and Dhaumya,<br>and Sanjaya of the suta order, and Vidura of great wisdom, and Yuyutsu of<br>Kurus race, and all his servants headed by Indrasena, and all the other<br>sutas that were with him, saying, Cause the funeral rites of the slain,<br>numbering by thousands, to be duly performed, so that nobody may perish<br>for want of persons to take care of them! At this command of king<br>Yudhishthira the just, Vidura and Sanjaya and Sudharma and Dhaumya and<br>Indrasena and others, procuring sandal, aloe and other kinds of wood used<br>on such occasions, as also clarified butter and oil and perfumes and<br>costly silken robes and other kinds of cloth, and large heaps of dry<br>wood, and broken cars and diverse kinds of weapons, caused funeral pyres<br>to be duly made and lighted and then without haste burnt, with due rites<br>the slain kings in proper order. They properly burned upon those fires<br>that blazed forth with libations of clarified butter in torrents over<br>them, the bodies of Duryodhana and his hundred brothers, of Shalya, and<br>king Bhurishrava; of king Jayadratha and Abhimanyu, O Bharata; of<br>Duhshasanas son and Lakshmana and king Dhrishtaketu; of Vrihanta and<br>Somadatta and the hundreds of Srinjayas; of king Kshemadhanva and Virata<br>and Drupada; of Shikhandi the prince of Pancalas, and Dhrishtadyumna of<br>Prishatas race; of the valiant Yudhamanyu and Uttamauja; of the ruler of<br>the Kosalas, the sons of Draupadi, and Shakuni the son of Subala; of<br>Acala and Vrishaka, and king Bhagadatta; of Karna and his son of great<br>wrath; of those great bowmen, the Kekaya princes, and those mighty<br>car-warriors, the Trigartas; of Ghatotkaca the prince of rakshasas, and<br>the brother of Vaka, of Alambusha, the foremost of rakshasas, and king<br>Jalasandha; and of hundreds and thousands of other kings. The pitri-medha<br>rites in honour of some of the illustrious dead were performed there,<br>while some sang Samas, and some uttered lamentations for the dead. With<br>the loud noise of Samas and Riks, and the lamentations of the women, all<br>creatures became stupefied that night. The funeral fires, smokeless and<br>blazing brightly (amid the surrounding darkness), looked like luminous<br>planets in the firmament enveloped by clouds. Those among the dead that<br>had come from diverse realms and were utterly friendless were piled<br>together in thousands of heaps and, at the command of Yudhishthira, were<br>caused to be burnt by Vidura through a large number of persons acting<br>coolly and influenced by good-will and affection, on pyres made of dry<br>wood. Having caused their last rites to be performed, the Kuru king<br>Yudhishthira, placing Dhritarashtra at his head, proceeded towards the<br>river Ganga."
