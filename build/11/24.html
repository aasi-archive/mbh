                            "Gandhari said, Behold the son of Somadatta, who was slain by Yuyudhana,<br>pecked at and torn by a large number of birds! Burning with grief at the<br>death of his son, Somadatta, O Janardana, (as he lies there) seems to<br>censure the great bowman Yuyudhana. There the mother of Bhurishrava, that<br>faultless lady, overcome with grief, is addressing her lord Somadatta,<br>saying, "By good luck, O king, thou seest not this terrible carnage of<br>the Bharatas, this extermination of the Kurus, this sight that resembles<br>the scenes occurring at the end of the yuga. By good luck, thou seest not<br>thy heroic son, who bore the device of the sacrificial stake on his<br>banner and who performed numerous sacrifices with profuse presents to<br>all, slain on the field of battle. By good luck, thou hearest not those<br>frightful wails of woe uttered amidst this carnage by thy<br>daughters-in-law like the screams of a flight of cranes on the bosom of<br>the sea. Thy daughters-in-law, bereaved of both husbands and sons, are<br>running hither and thither, each clad in a single piece of raiment and<br>each with her black tresses all dishevelled. By good luck, thou seest not<br>thy son, that tiger among men, deprived of one of his arms, overthrown by<br>Arjuna, and even now in course of being devoured by beasts of prey. By<br>good luck, thou seest not today thy son slain in battle, and Bhurishrava<br>deprived of life, and thy widowed daughters-in-law plunged into grief. By<br>good luck, thou seest not the golden umbrella of that illustrious warrior<br>who had the sacrificial stake for the device on his banner, torn and<br>broken on the terrace of his car. There the black-eyed wives of<br>Bhurishrava are indulging in piteous lamentations, surrounding their lord<br>slain by Satyaki. Afflicted with grief on account of the slaughter of<br>their lords, those ladies, indulging in copious lamentations, are falling<br>down on the earth with their faces towards the ground, and slowly<br>approaching thee, O Keshava! Alas, why did Arjuna of pure deeds<br>perpetrate such a censurable act, since he struck off the arm of a<br>heedless warrior who was brave and devoted to the performance of<br>sacrifices. Alas, Satyaki did an act that was still more sinful, for he<br>took the life of a person of restrained soul while sitting in the<br>observance of the praya vow. Alas, O righteous one, thou liest on the<br>ground, slain unfairly by two foes." Even thus, O Madhava, those wives of<br>Bhurishrava are crying aloud in woe. There, those wives of that warrior,<br>all possessed of slender waists, are placing upon their laps the lopped<br>off arm of their lord and weeping bitterly!<br><br>"Here is that arm which used to invade the girdles, grind the deep<br>bosoms, and touch the navel, the thighs, and the hips, of fair women, and<br>loosen the ties of the drawers worn by them! Here is that arm which slew<br>foes and dispelled the fears of friends, which gave thousands of kine and<br>exterminated Kshatriyas in battle! In the presence of Vasudeva himself,<br>Arjuna of unstained deeds, lopped it off thy heedless self while thou<br>wert engaged with another in battle. What, indeed, wilt thou, O<br>Janardana, say of this great feat of Arjuna while speaking of it in the<br>midst of assemblies. What also will the diadem-decked Arjuna himself say<br>of it?" Censuring thee in this way, that foremost of ladies hath stopped<br>at last. The co-wives of that lady are piteously lamenting with her as if<br>she were their daughter-in-law!<br><br>"There the mighty Shakuni, the chief of gandharvas, of prowess incapable<br>of being baffled, hath been slain by Sahadeva, the maternal uncle by the<br>sisters son! Formerly, he used to be fanned with a couple of gold-handed<br>fans! Alas, now, his prostrate form is being fanned by birds with their<br>wings! He used to assume hundreds and thousands of forms. All the<br>illusions, however, of that individual possessed of great deceptive<br>powers, have been burnt by the energy of the son of Pandu. An expert in<br>guile, he had vanquished Yudhishthira in the assembly by his powers of<br>deception and won from him his vast kingdom. The son of Pandu, however,<br>hath now won Shakunis life-breaths. Behold, O Krishna, a large number of<br>birds is now sitting around Shakuni. An expert in dice, alas, he had<br>acquired that skill for the destruction of my sons. This fire of<br>hostility with the Pandavas had been ignited by Shakuni for the<br>destruction of my children as also of himself and his followers and<br>kinsmen. Like those acquired by my sons, O puissant one, by the use of<br>weapons, this one too, however wicked-souled, has acquired many regions<br>of bliss by the use of weapons. My fear, O slayer of Madhu, is that that<br>crooked person may not succeed in fomenting dissensions even (there, the<br>region attained by them) between my children, all of whom are confiding<br>and possessed of candour!"
