                            Vaishampayana said, "After all the warriors had been slaughtered, king<br>Yudhishthira the just heard that his uncle Dhritarashtra had set out from<br>the city called after the elephant. Afflicted with grief on account of<br>the death of his sons, Yudhishthira, O king, accompanied by his brothers,<br>set out for meeting his uncle, filled with sorrow and overwhelmed with<br>grief for the slaughter of his (hundred) sons. The son of Kunti was<br>followed by the high-souled and heroic Krishna of Dasharhas race, and by<br>Yuyudhana, as also by Yuyutsu. The princess Draupadi also, burning with<br>grief, and accompanied by those Pancala ladies that were with her,<br>sorrowfully followed her lord. Yudhishthira beheld near the banks of the<br>Ganga, O king, the crowd of Bharata ladies afflicted with woe and crying<br>like a flight of she-ospreys. The king was soon surrounded by those<br>thousands of ladies who, with arms raised aloft in grief, were indulging<br>in loud lamentations and giving expression to all kinds of words,<br>agreeable and disagreeable: Where, indeed, is that righteousness of the<br>king, where is truth and compassion, since he has slain sires and<br>brothers and preceptors and sons and friends? How, O mighty-armed one,<br>hath thy heart become tranquil after causing Drona, and thy grandsire<br>Bhishma, and Jayadratha, to be slaughtered? What need hast thou of<br>sovereignty, after having seen thy sires and brothers, O Bharata, and the<br>irresistible Abhimanyu and the sons of Draupadi, thus slaughtered?<br>Passing over those ladies crying like a flight of she-ospreys, the<br>mighty-armed king Yudhishthira the just saluted the feet of his eldest<br>uncle. Having saluted their sire according to custom, those slayers of<br>foes, the Pandavas, announced themselves to him, each uttering his own<br>name. Dhritarashtra, exceedingly afflicted with grief on account of the<br>slaughter of his sons, then reluctantly embraced the eldest son of Pandu,<br>who was the cause of that slaughter. Having embraced Yudhishthira the<br>just and spoken a few words of comfort to him, O Bharata, the<br>wicked-souled Dhritarashtra sought for Bhima, like a blazing fire ready<br>to burn everything that would approach it. Indeed, that fire of his<br>wrath, fanned by the wind of his grief, seemed then to be ready to<br>consume the Bhima-forest. Ascertaining the evil intentions cherished by<br>him towards Bhima, Krishna, dragging away the real Bhima, presented an<br>iron statue of the second son of Pandu to the old king. Possessed of<br>great intelligence, Krishna had, at the very outset, understood the<br>intentions of Dhritarashtra, and had, therefore, kept such a contrivance<br>ready for baffling them. Seizing with his two arms that iron Bhima, king<br>Dhritarashtra, possessed of great strength, broke into pieces, thinking<br>it to be Bhima himself in flesh and blood. Endued with might equal to<br>that of 10,000 elephants, the king reduced that statue into fragments.<br>His own breast, however, became considerably bruised and he began to<br>vomit blood. Covered with blood, the king fell down on the ground like a<br>parijata tree topped with its flowery burden. His learned charioteer<br>Sanjaya, the son of Gavalgana, raised the monarch and soothing and<br>comforting him, said, Do not act so. The king then, having cast off his<br>wrath and returned to his normal disposition, became filled with grief<br>and began to weep aloud, saying, Alas, oh Bhima, alas, oh Bhima!<br>Understanding that he was no longer under the influence of wrath, and<br>that he was truly sorry for having (as he believed) killed Bhima,<br>Vasudeva, that foremost of men, said these words, Do not grieve, O<br>Dhritarashtra, for thou hast not slain Bhimasena! That is an iron statue,<br>O king, which has been broken by thee! Understanding that thou wert<br>filled with rage, O bull of Bharatas race, I dragged the son of Kunti<br>away from within the jaws of Death. O tiger among kings, there is none<br>equal to thee in strength of body. What man is there, O mighty-armed one,<br>that would endure pressure of thy arms? Indeed, as no one can escape with<br>life from an encounter with the Destroyer himself, even so no body can<br>come out safe from within thy embrace. It was for this that yonder iron<br>statue of Bhima, which had been caused to be made by thy son, had been<br>kept ready for thee. Through grief for the death of thy sons, thy mind<br>has fallen off from righteousness. It is for this, O great king, that<br>thou seekest to slay Bhimasena. The slaughter of Bhima, however, O king,<br>would do thee no good. Thy sons, O monarch, would not be revived by it.<br>Therefore, do thou approve of what has been by us with a view to secure<br>peace and do not set thy heart on grief!"
