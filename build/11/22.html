                            "Gandhari said, Slain by Bhimasena, behold, the lord of Avanti lies<br>there! Vultures and jackals and crows are feeding upon that hero! Though<br>possessed of many friends, he lies now perfectly friendless! Behold, O<br>slayer of Madhu, having made a great slaughter of foes, that warrior is<br>now lying on the bed of a hero, covered with blood. Jackals, and kankas,<br>and other carnivorous creatures of diverse kinds, are dragging him now.<br>Behold the reverses brought about by Time. His wives, assembled together,<br>and crying in grief, are sitting around that hero who in life was a<br>terrible slayer of foes but who now lies on the bed of a hero. Behold,<br>Pratipas son Bahlika, that mighty bowman possessed of great energy, slain<br>with a broad-headed shaft, is now lying on the ground like a sleeping<br>tiger. Though deprived of life, the colour of his face is still<br>exceedingly bright, like that of the moon at full, risen on the fifteenth<br>day of the lighted fortnight! Burning with grief on account of the death<br>of his son, and desirous of accomplishing his vow, Indras son (Arjuna)<br>hath slain there that son of Vriddhakshatra! Behold that Jayadratha, who<br>was protected by the illustrious Drona, slain by Partha bent on<br>accomplishing his vow, after penetrating through eleven Akshauhinis of<br>troops. Inauspicious vultures, O Janardana, are feeding upon Jayadratha,<br>the lord of the Sindhu-Sauviras, full of pride and energy! Though sought<br>to be protected by his devoted wives, see, O Acyuta, carnivorous<br>creatures are dragging his body away to a jungle in the vicinity. The<br>Kamboja and Yavana wives of that mighty-armed lord of the Sindhus and the<br>Sauviras are waiting upon him for protecting him (from the wild beasts).<br>At that time, O Janardana, when Jayadratha, assisted by the Kekayas,<br>endeavoured to ravish Draupadi, he deserved to be slain by the Pandavas!<br>From regard, however, for Duhshala, they set him free on that occasion.<br>Why, O Krishna, did they not show some regard for that Duhshala once<br>more? That daughter of mine, of tender years, is now crying in grief. She<br>is striking her body with her own hands and censuring the Pandavas. What,<br>O Krishna, can be a greater grief to me than that my daughter of tender<br>years should be a widow and all my daughters-in-law should become<br>lordless. Alas, alas, behold, my daughter Duhshala, having cast off her<br>grief and fears, is running hither and thither in search of the head of<br>her husband. He who had checked all the Pandavas desirous of rescuing<br>their son, after causing the slaughter of a vast force, at last himself<br>succumbed to death. Alas, those wives of his, with faces as beautiful as<br>the moon, are crying, sitting around that irresistible hero who resembled<br>an infuriated elephant!"
