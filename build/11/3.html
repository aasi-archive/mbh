                            "Dhritarashtra said, O thou of great wisdom, my grief has been dispelled<br>by thy excellent words! I desire, however, to again hear thee speak. How,<br>indeed, do those that are wise free themselves from mental grief born of<br>the advent of evils and the bereavement of objects that are dear?<br><br>"Vidura said, He that is wise obtains tranquillity by subduing both grief<br>and joy through means by which one may escape from grief and joy. All<br>those things about which we are anxious, O bull among men, are ephemeral.<br>The world is like a plantain tree, without enduring strength. Since the<br>wise and the foolish, the rich and the poor, all, divested of their<br>anxieties, sleep on the crematorium, with bodies reft of flesh and full<br>of bare bones and shrivelled sinews, whom amongst them will the survivors<br>look upon as possessed of distinguishing marks by which the attributes of<br>birth and beauty may be ascertained? (When all are equal in death) why<br>should human beings, whose understandings are always deceived (by the<br>things of this world) covet one anothers rank and position? The learned<br>say that the bodies of men are like houses. In time these are destroyed.<br>There is one being, however, that is eternal. As a person, casting off<br>one attire, whether old or new, wears another, even such is the case with<br>the bodies of all embodied beings. O son of Vicitravirya, creatures<br>obtain weal or woe as the fruit of their own acts. Through their acts<br>they obtain heaven, O Bharata, or bliss, or woe. Whether able or unable,<br>they have to bear their burdens which are the result of their own acts.<br>As amongst earthen pots some break while still on the potters wheel, some<br>while partially shaped, some as soon as brought into shape, some after<br>removal from the wheel, some while in course of being removed, some after<br>removal, some while wet, some while dry, some while being burnt, some<br>while being removed from the kiln, some after removal therefrom, and some<br>while being used, even such is the case with the bodies of embodied<br>creatures. Some are destroyed while yet in the womb, some after coming<br>out of the womb, some on the day after, some on the expiration of a<br>fortnight or of a month, some on the expiration of a year or of two<br>years, some in youth, some in middle age, and some when old. Creatures<br>are born or destroyed according to their acts in previous lives. When<br>such is the course of the world, why do you then indulge in grief? As<br>men, while swimming in sport on the water, sometimes dive and sometimes<br>emerge, O king, even so creatures sink and emerge in lifes stream. They<br>that are of little wisdom suffer or meet with destruction as the result<br>of their own acts. They, however, that are wise, observant of virtue, and<br>desirous of doing good unto all living creatures, they, acquainted with<br>the real nature of the appearance of creatures in this world, attain at<br>last to the highest end."
