                            Vaishampayana said, "Commanded by Dhritarashtra, those bulls of Kurus<br>race, the Pandava brothers, accompanied by Keshava, then proceeded to see<br>Gandhari. The faultless Gandhari, afflicted with grief on account of the<br>death of her hundred sons, recollecting that king Yudhishthira the just<br>had slain all his enemies, wished to curse him. Understanding her evil<br>intentions towards the Pandavas, the son of Satyavati addressed himself<br>for counteracting them at the very outset. Having cleansed himself by the<br>sacred and fresh water of the Ganga, the great rishi, capable of<br>proceeding everywhere at will with the fleetness of the mind, came to<br>that spot. Capable of seeing the heart of every creature with his<br>spiritual vision and with his mind directed towards it, the sage made his<br>appearance there. Endued with great ascetic merit and ever intent on<br>saying what was for the benefit of creatures, the rishi, addressing his<br>daughter-in-law at the proper moment, said, Do not avail thyself of this<br>opportunity for denouncing a curse. On the other hand, utilize it for<br>showing thy forgiveness. Thou shouldst not be angry with the Pandavas, O<br>Gandhari! Set thy heart on peace. Restrain the words that are about to<br>fall from thy lips. Listen to my advice. Thy son, desirous of victory,<br>had besought thee every day for the eighteen days that battle lasted,<br>saying, "O mother, bless me who am fighting with my foes." Implored every<br>day in these words by thy son desirous of victory, the answer thou always<br>gavest him was, "Thither is victory where righteousness is!" I do not, O<br>Gandhari, remember that any words spoken by thee have become false. Those<br>words, therefore, that thou, implored by Duryodhana, saidst unto him,<br>could not be false. Thou art always employed in the good of all<br>creatures. Having without doubt reached the other shore in that dreadful<br>battle of Kshatriyas, the sons of Pandu have certainly won the victory<br>and a measure of righteousness that is much greater. Thou wert formerly<br>observant of the virtue of forgiveness. Why wouldst thou not observe it<br>now? Subdue unrighteousness, O thou that art conversant with<br>righteousness. There is victory where righteousness is. Remembering thy<br>own righteousness and the words spoken by thyself, restrain thy wrath, O<br>Gandhari! Do not act otherwise, O thou that art beautiful in speech.<br>Hearing these words, Gandhari said, O holy one, I do not cherish any ill<br>feelings towards the Pandavas, nor do I wish that they should perish. In<br>consequence, however, of grief for the death of my sons, my heart is very<br>much agitated. I know that I should protect the Pandavas with as much<br>care as Kunti herself protects them, and that Dhritarashtra also should<br>protect them as I should. Through the fault of Duryodhana and of Shakuni<br>the son of Subala, and through the action of Karna and Duhshasana,<br>extermination of the Kurus hath taken place. In this matter the slightest<br>blame cannot attach to Vibhatsu or to Prithas son Vrikodara, or to Nakula<br>or Sahadeva, or to Yudhishthira himself. While engaged in battle, the<br>Kauravas, swelling with arrogance and pride, have fallen along with many<br>others (that came to their aid). I am not grieved at this. But there has<br>been one act done by Bhima in the very presence of Vasudeva (that moves<br>my resentment). The high-souled Vrikodara, having challenged Duryodhana<br>to a dreadful encounter with mace, and having come to know that my son,<br>while careering in diverse kinds of motion in the battle, was superior to<br>him in skill, struck the latter below the navel. It is this that moves my<br>wrath. Why should heroes, for the sake of their lives, cast off<br>obligations of duty that have been determined by high-souled persons<br>conversant with every duty?"
