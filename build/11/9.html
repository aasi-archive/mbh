                            Janamejaya said, "After the holy Vyasa had departed, what, O regenerate<br>sage, did king Dhritarashtra, do? It behoveth thee to tell me this. What<br>also did the Kuru king, the high-souled son of Dharma, do? And how did<br>those three, Kripa and others, do? I have heard of the feats of<br>Ashvatthama and the mutual denouncement of curses. Tell me what happened<br>next and what Sanjaya next said (unto the old king)."<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "After Duryodhana had been slain and all the troops<br>slaughtered, Sanjaya, deprived of his spiritual sight, came back to<br>Dhritarashtra.<br><br>"Sanjaya said, The kings of diverse peoples, that came from diverse<br>realms, have all, O king, gone to the regions of the dead, along with thy<br>sons. Thy son, O king, who had constantlybeen implored (for peace) but<br>who always wished to terminate his hostility (with the Pandavas by<br>slaughtering them) has caused the earth to be exterminated. Do thou, O<br>king, cause the obsequial rites of thy sons and grandsons and sires to be<br>performed according to due order!"<br><br>Vaishampayana continued, "Hearing these terrible words of Sanjaya, the<br>king fell down on the Earth and lay motionless like one deprived of life.<br>Approaching the monarch who was lying prostrate on the Earth, Vidura,<br>conversant with every duty, said these words: Rise, O king, why dost thou<br>lie down thus? Do not grieve, O bull of Bharatas race! Even this, O lord<br>of Earth, is the final end of all creatures. At first creatures are<br>non-existent. In the interim, O Bharata, they become existent. At the<br>end, they once more become non-existent. What cause of sorrow is there in<br>all this? By indulging in grief, one cannot get back the dead. By<br>indulging in grief, one cannot die himself. When such is the course of<br>the world, why dost thou indulge in grief? One may die without having<br>been engaged in battle. One also escapes with life after being engaged in<br>battle. When ones Time comes, O king, one cannot escape! Time drags all<br>kinds of creatures. There is none dear or hateful to Time, O best of the<br>Kurus! As the wind tears off the ends of all blades of grass, even so all<br>creatures, O bull of Bharatas race, are brought by Time under its<br>influence. All creatures are like members of the same caravan bound for<br>the same destination. What cause of sorrow is there if Time meets with<br>one a little earlier than with another? Those again, O king, that have<br>fallen in battle and for whom thou grievest, are not really objects of<br>thy grief, since all those illustrious ones have gone to heaven. By<br>sacrifices with profuse presents, by ascetic austerities, and by<br>knowledge, people cannot so easily repair to heaven as heroes by courage<br>in battle. All those heroes were conversant with the Vedas; all of them<br>were observant of vows; all of them have perished, facing the foe in<br>battle. What cause of sorrow then is there? They poured their arrowy<br>libations upon the bodies of their brave foes as upon a fire. Foremost of<br>men, they bore in return the arrowy libations poured upon themselves. I<br>tell thee, O king, that there is no better way to heaven for a Kshatriya<br>than through battle. All of them were high-souled Kshatriyas, all of them<br>were heroes and ornaments of assemblies. They have attained to a high<br>state of blessedness. One should not grieve for them. Do thou comfort thy<br>own self. Do not grieve, O bull among men! It behoveth thee not to suffer<br>thyself to be overwhelmed with sorrow and abandon all action."
