                            "Dhritarashtra said, Excellent is this parable that thou hast recited!<br>Indeed, thou art acquainted with truth! Having listened to thy nectarlike<br>speech, I desire to hear thee more.<br><br>"Vidura said, Listen to me, O king, I shall once more discourse in detail<br>on those means an acquaintance with which enable the wise to free<br>themselves from the ties of the world. As a person, O king, who has to<br>travel a long way is sometimes obliged to halt when fatigued with toil,<br>even so, O Bharata, they that are of little intelligence, travelling<br>along the extended way of life, have to make frequent halts in the shape<br>of repeated births in the womb. They, however, that are wise are free<br>from that obligation. Men conversant with the scriptures, for this,<br>describe lifes course as a long way. The wise also call lifes round with<br>all its difficulties a forest. Creatures, O bull of Bharatas race,<br>whether mobile or immobile, have to repeatedly return to the world. The<br>wise alone escape. The diseases, mental and physical, to which mortals<br>are subject, whether visible or invisible, are spoken of as beasts of<br>prey by the wise. Men are always afflicted and impeded by them, O<br>Bharata! Then again, those fierce beasts of prey, represented by their<br>own acts in life, never cause any anxiety to them that are of little<br>intelligence. If any person, O monarch, somehow escapes from diseases,<br>Decrepitude, that destroyer of beauty, overwhelmshim afterwards. Plunged<br>in a slough by the objects of the different senses&#8212;sound and form and<br>taste and touch and scent&#8212;man remains there without anything to rescue<br>him thence. Meanwhile, the years, the seasons, the months, the<br>fortnights, the days, and the nights, coming one after another, gradually<br>despoil him of beauty and lessen the period allotted to him. These all<br>are messengers of death. They, however, that are of little understanding<br>know them not to be such. The wise say that all creatures are governed by<br>the Ordainer through their acts. The body of a creature is called the<br>car. The living principle is the driver of (that car). The senses are<br>said to be steeds. Our acts and the understanding are the traces. He who<br>followeth after those running steeds has to come repeatedly to this world<br>in a round of rebirths. He, however, who, being self-restrained restrains<br>them by his understanding hath not to come back. They, however, that are<br>not stupefied while wandering in this wheel of life that is revolving<br>like a real wheel, do not in reality wander in a round of rebirths. He<br>that is wise should certainly take care to prevent the obligation of<br>rebirth. One should not be indifferent to this, for indifference may<br>subject us to it repeatedly. The man, O king, who has restrained his<br>senses and subdued wrath and covetousness, who is contented, and truthful<br>in speech, succeeds in obtaining peace. This body is called the car of<br>Yama. Then those that are of little intelligence are stupefied by it.<br>Such a person, O king, would obtain that which thou hast obtained. The<br>loss of kingdom, of friends, and of children, O Bharata, and such as<br>these, overtake him who is still under the influence of desire. He that<br>is wise should apply the medicine of intelligence to all great griefs.<br>Indeed, obtaining the medicine of wisdom, which is truly very efficacious<br>and is almost unattainable, the man of restrained soul would kill that<br>serious disease called sorrow. Neither prowess, nor wealth, nor friend,<br>nor well-wishers can cure a man of his grief so effectually as the<br>self-restrained soul. Therefore, observant of the great duty of<br>abstention from all injuries, or friendship for all creatures, be of<br>pious behaviour, O Bharata! Self-restraint, renunciation, and heedfulness<br>are the three steeds of Brahman. He who rides on the car of his soul,<br>unto which are yoked these steeds with the aid of traces furnished by<br>good conduct, and drives it, casting off all fear of death, proceedeth, O<br>king, to the regions of Brahman. That person, O monarch, who gives unto<br>all creatures an assurance of his harmlessness, goes to the highest of<br>regions, the blessed realm of Vishnu. The fruit that one obtains by an<br>assurance unto all creatures of his harmlessness cannot be obtained by a<br>1,000 sacrifices or by daily fasts. Amongst all things there is certainly<br>nothing dearer than self. Death is certainly disliked by all creatures, O<br>Bharata! Therefore, compassion should certainly be shown unto all. Endued<br>with diverse kinds of errors entangled by the net of their own<br>intelligence, they that are wicked and are of good vision, wander<br>repeatedly on the earth. They however, that are wise and endued with<br>subtle sight, attain to a union with Brahman."
