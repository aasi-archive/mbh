                            "Dhritarashtra said, Alas, great was the distress of that person and very<br>painful his mode of life! Tell me, O first of speakers, whence was his<br>attachment to life and whence his happiness? Where is that region, so<br>unfavourable to the practice of virtue, in which that person resides? Oh,<br>tell me how will that man be freed from all those great terrors? Tell me<br>all this! We shall then exert ourselves properly for him. My compassion<br>has been greatly moved by the difficulties that lie in the way of his<br>rescue!<br><br>"Vidura said, They that are conversant, O monarch, with the religion of<br>moksha cite this as a simile. Understanding this properly, a person may<br>attain to bliss in the regions hereafter. That which is described as the<br>wilderness is the great world. The inaccessible forest within it is the<br>limited sphere of ones own life. Those that have been mentioned as beasts<br>of prey are the diseases (to which we are subject). That woman of<br>gigantic proportions residing in the forest is identified by the wise<br>with Decrepitude which destroys complexion and beauty. That which has<br>been spoken of as the pit is the body or physical frame of embodied<br>creatures. The huge snake dwelling in the bottom of that pit is time, the<br>destroyer of all embodied creatures. It is, indeed, the universal<br>destroyer. The cluster of creepers growing in that pit and attached to<br>whose spreading stems the man hangeth down is the desire for life which<br>is cherished by every creature. The six-faced elephant, O king, which<br>proceeds towards the tree standing at the mouth of the pit is spoken of<br>as the year. Its six faces are the seasons and its twelve feet are the<br>twelve months. The rats and the snakes that are cutting off the tree are<br>said to be days and nights that are continually lessening the periods of<br>life of all creatures. Those that have been described as bees are our<br>desires. The numerous jets that are dropping honey are the pleasures<br>derived from the gratification of our desires and to which men are seen<br>to be strongly addicted. The wise know lifes course to be even such.<br>Through that knowledge they succeed in tearing off its bonds."
