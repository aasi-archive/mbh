                            Vaishampayana said, "Even after hearing the words of Vidura, the chief of<br>the Kurus, afflicted with grief on account of the death of his sons, fell<br>down senseless on the Earth. Beholding him fall down in that state, his<br>friends, as also the island-born Vyasa, and Vidura, and Sanjaya, and<br>other well-wishers, and the attendants who used to wait at the gates and<br>who enjoyed his confidence, sprinkled cool water over his body, and<br>fanned him with palm leaves, and gently rubbed him with their hands. For<br>a long while they comforted the king while in that condition. The<br>monarch, recovering his senses after a long time, wept for a long while,<br>overwhelmed with grief on account of the death of his sons. He said, Fie<br>on the state of humanity! Fie on the human body! The woes that are<br>suffered in this life frequently arise from the very state of humanity.<br>Alas, O lord, great is the grief, like poison or fire, that one suffers<br>at the loss of sons, of wealth, of kinsmen, and relatives. That grief<br>causes the limbs to burn and our wisdom to be destroyed. Overwhelmed with<br>that grief, a person regards death to be preferable. This calamity that<br>has overtaken me through ill-luck is even like that. It will not, I see,<br>end except with life itself. O best of regenerate ones, I shall,<br>therefore, put an end to my life this very day. Having said these words<br>unto his high-souled sire, that foremost of all persons conversant with<br>Brahman, Dhritarashtra, overwhelmed with grief, became stupefied. The<br>king, O monarch reflecting on his woes, became speechless. Hearing these<br>words of his, the puissant Vyasa thus spoke unto his son afflicted with<br>grief on account of the death of his children.<br><br>"Vyasa said, O mighty-armed Dhritarashtra, listen to what I say. Thou art<br>possessed of learning, thou hast great intelligence, and thou, O puissant<br>one, art skilled in understanding duties. Nothing of that which should be<br>known is unknown to thee, O scorcher of foes! Without doubt, thou knowest<br>the instability of all things doomed to death. When the world of life is<br>unstable when this world itself is not eternal, when life is sure to end<br>in death, why then, O Bharata, dost thou grieve? Before thy very eyes, O<br>king, the concatenation of facts brought about by Time making thy son the<br>cause, produced this hostility. This destruction of the Kurus, O king,<br>was inevitable. Why then dost thou grieve for those heroes that have<br>attained to the highest end? O thou of mighty arms, the high-souled<br>Vidura knew everything. With all his might he had endeavoured, O king, to<br>bring about peace. It is my opinion that the course marked out by Destiny<br>cannot be controlled by anyone, even if one struggles for eternity. The<br>course that was settled by the gods was heard directly by me. I will<br>recite it to thee, so that tranquillity of mind may be thine. Once<br>before, without any fatigue, I repaired very quickly to the court of<br>Indra. There I beheld all the denizens of heaven assembled together.<br>There were, O sinless one, all the celestial rishis also, headed by<br>Narada. There, O monarch, I saw also the Earth (in her embodied form).<br>The latter had repaired to the gods for the accomplishment of a<br>particular mission. Approaching the gods, she said, "That which ye all<br>should do for me hath, ye blessed ones, been already promised by you<br>while you were in Brahmas abode. Let that be accomplished soon." Hearing<br>these words of hers, Vishnu, the adored of all the worlds, smilingly<br>addressed her in the midst of the celestial conclave, saying, "The eldest<br>of the hundred sons of Dhritarashtra, who is known by the name of<br>Duryodhana, will accomplish thy business. Through that king, thy purpose<br>will be achieved. For his sake, many kings will assemble together on the<br>field of Kuru. Capable of smiting, they will cause one another to be<br>slain through the instrumentality of hard weapons. It is evident, O<br>goddess, that thy burthen will then be lightened in battle. Go quickly to<br>thy own place and continue to bear the weight of creatures, O beauteous<br>one!" From this thou wilt understand, O king, that thy son Duryodhana,<br>born in Gandharis womb, was a portion of Kali, sprung for the object of<br>causing a universal slaughter. He was vindictive, restless, wrathful, and<br>difficult of being gratified. Through the influence of Destiny his<br>brothers also became like him. Shakuni became his maternal uncle and<br>Karna his great friend. Many other kings were born on earth for aiding in<br>the work of destruction. As the king is, so do his subjects become. If<br>the king becomes righteous, even unrighteousness (in his dominions)<br>assumes the shape of righteousness. Servants, without doubt, are affected<br>by the merits and defects of their masters. Those sons of thine, O king,<br>having obtained a bad king, have all been destroyed. Conversant with<br>truth, Narada, knew all this. Thy sons, through their own faults, have<br>been destroyed, O king! Do not grieve for them, O monarch! There is no<br>cause for grief. The Pandavas have not, O Bharata, the least fault in<br>what has happened. Thy sons were all of wicked souls. It is they that<br>caused this destruction on earth. Blessed be thou; Narada had truly<br>informed Yudhishthira of all this in his court on the occasion of the<br>rajasuya sacrifice, saying, "The Pandavas and the Kauravas, encountering<br>each other, will meet with destruction. Do that, O son of Kunti, which<br>thou shouldst!" Upon these words of Narada, the Pandavas became filled<br>with grief. I have thus told thee that which is an eternal secret of the<br>gods. This will destroy thy grief and restore to thee a love of thy<br>life-breath, and cause thee to cherish affection for the Pandavas, for<br>all that has happened has been due to what had been ordained by the gods.<br>O thou of mighty arms, I had learnt all this sometime before. I also<br>spoke of it to king Yudhishthira the just on the occasion of his foremost<br>of sacrifices, the rajasuya. When I secretly informed him of all this,<br>Dharmas son endeavoured his best for preserving peace with the Kauravas.<br>That, however, which is ordained by the gods proved too powerful (to be<br>frustrated by him). The fiat, O king of the Destroyer, is incapable of<br>being baffled anyhow by mobile and immobile creatures. Thou art devoted<br>to virtue and possessed of superior intelligence, O Bharata! Thou knowest<br>also that which is the way and that which is not the way of all<br>creatures. If king Yudhishthira learns that thou art burning with grief<br>and losing thy senses frequently, he will cast off his very life-breath.<br>He is always compassionate and possessed of wisdom. His kindness extends<br>even to all the inferior creatures. How is it possible, O king, that he<br>will not show compassion to thee, O monarch? At my command, and knowing<br>that what is ordained is inevitable, as also from kindness to the<br>Pandavas, continue to bear thy life, O Bharata! If thou livest thus, thy<br>fame will spread in the world. Thou shalt then be able to acquire a<br>knowledge of all duties and find many years for obtaining ascetic merit.<br>This grief for the death of thy sons that has arisen in thy heart, like a<br>blazing fire, should always be extinguished, O king, by the water of<br>wisdom!""<br><br>Vaishampayana continued, "Hearing these words of Vyasa of immeasurable<br>energy and reflecting upon them for a little while, Dhritarashtra said, O<br>best of regenerate ones, I am exceedingly afflicted by a heavy load of<br>grief. My senses are repeatedly forsaking me and I am unable to bear up<br>my own self. Hearing, however, these words of thine about what had been<br>ordained by the gods, I shall not think of casting off my life-breath and<br>shall live and act without indulging in grief! Hearing these words of<br>Dhritarashtra, O monarch, Satyavatis son, Vyasa, disappeared then and<br>there."
