                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Then clad in a cowherd's dress, and speaking the<br>dialect of cowherds, Sahadeva came to the cowpen of Virata's city. And<br>beholding that bull among men, who was shining in splendour, the king was<br>struck with amazement. And he directed his men to summon Sahadeva. And<br>when the latter came, the king addressed him, saying, 'To whom dost thou<br>belong? And whence dost thou come? And what work dost thou seek? I have<br>never seen thee before. O bull among men, tell me truly about thee.'<br><br>'Having come before the king that afflicter of foes, Sahadeva answered in<br>accents deep as the roar of the cloud, 'I am a Vaisya, Arishtanemi by<br>name. I was employed as a cowherd in the service of those bulls of the<br>Kuru race, the sons of Pandu. O foremost of men, I intend now to live<br>beside thee, for I do not know where those lions among kings, the sons of<br>Pritha, are. I cannot live without service, and, O king, I do not like to<br>enter into the service of anyone else save thee.'<br><br>"Hearing these words, Virata said, 'Thou must either be a Brahmana or a<br>Kshatriya. Thou lookest as if thou wert the lord of the entire earth<br>surrounded by the sea. Tell me truly, O thou that mowest down thy foes.<br>The office of a Vaisya is not fit for thee. Tell me from the dominions of<br>what king thou comest, and what thou knowest, and in what capacity thou<br>wouldst remain with us, and also what pay thou wouldst accept.'<br><br>"Sahadeva answered, 'Yudhishthira, the eldest of the five sons of Pandu,<br>had one division of kine numbering eight hundred and ten thousand, and<br>another, ten thousand, and another, again, twenty thousand, and so on. I<br>was employed in keeping those cattle. People used to call me Tantripala.<br>I know the present, the past, and the future of all kine living within<br>ten Yojanas, and whose tale has been taken. My merits were known to that<br>illustrious one, and the Kuru king Yudhishthira was well-pleased with me.<br>I am also acquainted with the means which aid kine in multiplying within<br>a short time, and by which they may enjoy immunity from disease. Also<br>these arts are known to me. I can also single out bulls having auspicious<br>marks for which they are worshipped by men, and by smelling whose urine,<br>the barren may conceive.'<br><br>"Virata said, 'I have a hundred thousand kine divided into distinct<br>herds. All those together with their keepers, I place in thy charge.<br>Henceforth my beasts will be in thy keep.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then, O king, undiscovered by that monarch,<br>that lord of men, Sahadeva, maintained by Virata, began to live happily.<br>Nor did anyone else (besides his brothers) recognise him.'"
