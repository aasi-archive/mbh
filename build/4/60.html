                            "Arjuna said, 'The time, O Karna, hath now come for making good thy<br>loquacious boast in the midst of the assembly, viz., that there is none<br>equal to thee in fight. Today, O Karna, contending with me in terrible<br>conflict, thou shalt know thy own strength, and shalt no longer disregard<br>others. Abandoning good breeding, thou hadst uttered many harsh words,<br>but this that thou endeavourest to do, is, I think, exceedingly<br>difficult. Do thou now, O Radha's son, contending with me in the sight of<br>the Kurus, make good what thou hadst said before in disregard of myself.<br>Thou who hadst witnessed Panchala's princess outraged by villains in the<br>midst of the court, do thou now reap the fruit of that act of thine.<br>Fettered by the bonds of morality before, I desisted from vengeance then.<br>Behold now, O son of Radha, the fruit of that wrath in conflict at hand.<br>O wicked wight, we have suffered much misery in that forest for full<br>twelve; years. Reap thou today the fruits of our concentrated vengeance.<br>Come, O Karna, cope with me in battle. Let these thy Kaurava warriors<br>witness the conflict. Hearing these words, Karna replied, 'Do thou, O<br>Partha, accomplish in deed what thou sayst in words. The world knows that<br>thy words verily exceed thy deed. That thou hadst foreborne formerly was<br>owing to thy inability to do anything. If we witness thy prowess even<br>now, we may acknowledge its truth. If thy past forbearance was due to thy<br>having been bound by the bonds of morality, truly thou art equally bound<br>now although thou regardest thyself free. Having as thou sayst, passed<br>thy exile in the woods in strict accordance with thy pledge and being<br>therefore weakened by practising an ascetic course of life, how canst<br>thou desire a combat with me now! O Pritha's son, if Sakra himself fight<br>on thy side, still I would feel no anxiety in putting forth my prowess.<br>Thy wish, O son of Kunti, is about to be gratified. Do thou fight with me<br>now, and behold my strength.' Hearing this, Arjuna said, 'Even now, O<br>Radha's son, thou hadst fled from battle with me, and it is for this that<br>thou livest although thy younger brother hath been slain. What other<br>person, save thee, having beheld his younger brother slain in battle<br>would himself fly from the field, and boast as thou dost, amid good and<br>true men?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said these words unto Karna, the<br>invincible Vibhatsu rushed at him and charged a volley, of shafts capable<br>of penetrating through a coat of mail. But that mighty car-warrior,<br>Karna, received with great alacrity that discharge with an arrowy shower<br>of his own, heavy as the downpour of the clouds. And that fierce volley<br>of arrows covered all sides and severally pierced the steeds and arms and<br>leathern fences of the combatants. And incapable of putting up with that<br>assault, Arjuna cut off the strings of Karna's quiver by means of a<br>straight and sharp arrow. Thereupon, taking out from his quiver another<br>arrow, Karna pierced the Pandava in the hand at which the latter's hold<br>of the bow was loosened. And then the mighty-armed Partha cut off Karna's<br>bow into fragments. And Karna replied by hurling a dart at his adversary,<br>but Arjuna cut it off by means of his arrows. And then the warriors that<br>followed the son of Radha rushed in crowds at Arjuna, but Partha sent<br>them all to the abode of Yama by means of arrows shot from the Gandiva.<br>And Vibhatsu slew the steeds of Karna by means of sharp and tough arrows<br>shot from the bow-string drawn to the ear, and deprived of life they<br>dropped down on the ground. And taking another sharp and blazing arrow<br>endued with great energy, the mighty son of Kunti pierced the breast of<br>Kama. And that arrow, cleaving through his mail, penetrated into his<br>body. And at this, Karna's vision was obscured and his senses left him.<br>And regaining consciousness, he felt a great pain, and leaving the combat<br>fled in a northernly direction. And at this, the mighty car-warrior<br>Arjuna and Uttara, both began to address him contumely.'"
