                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Then, on the third day, attired in white robes after<br>a bath, and decked in ornaments of all kinds, those great car-warriors,<br>the five Pandava brothers, having accomplished their row, and with<br>Yudhishthira at their head, looked resplendent as they entered the<br>palace-gate like five intoxicated elephants. And having entered the<br>council-hall of Virata, they took their seats on the thrones reserved for<br>kings, and shone brilliantly like fires on the sacrificial altar. And<br>after Pandavas had taken their seats, Virata, that lord of earth, came<br>there for holding his council and discharging other royal offices. And<br>beholding the illustrious Pandavas blazing like fires, the king reflected<br>for a moment. And them, filled with wrath, the Matsya king spoke unto<br>Kanka seated there like a celestial and looking like the lord of<br>celestials surrounded by the Maruts. And he said, 'A player at dice thou<br>wert employed by me as a courtier! How couldst thou occupy the royal seat<br>thus attired in handsome robes and ornaments?"<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of Virata, O king, and<br>desirous of jesting with him, Arjuna smilingly said in reply, 'This<br>person, O king, deserveth to occupy the same seat with Indra himself.<br>Devoted to the Brahmanas, acquainted with the Vedas, indifferent to<br>luxury and carnal enjoyments, habitually performing sacrifices, steady in<br>vows, this one, indeed, is the very embodiment of virtue, The foremost of<br>all Persons endued with energy and superior to every body on earth in<br>intelligence, devoted to asceticism, he is conversant with various<br>weapons. No other person among the mobile and immobile creatures of the<br>three worlds possesseth or will ever possess such knowledge of weapons.<br>And there is none even amongst the gods, or Asuras, or men, or Rakshasas,<br>or Gandharvas, or Yaksha chiefs, or Kinnaras&#8212;or mighty Uragas, who is<br>like him. Endued with great foresight and energy, beloved by the citizens<br>and inhabitants of the provinces, he is the mightiest of car-warriors<br>amongst the sons of Pandu. A performer of sacrifices, devoted to<br>morality, and of subdued passions, like unto a great Rishi, this royal<br>sage is celebrated over all the worlds. Possessed of great strength and<br>great intelligence, able and truthful, he hath all his senses under<br>complete control. Equal unto Indra in wealth and Kuvera in hoarding, he<br>is the protector of the worlds like unto Manu himself of mighty prowess.<br>Endued with great might, he is even such. Kind unto all creatures he is<br>no other than the bull of the Kuru race, king Yudhishthira the just. The<br>achievements of this king resemble the sun himself of blazing effulgence.<br>And his fame hath travelled in all directions like the rays of that<br>luminary. And like the rays following the risen sun of blazing<br>effulgence, ten thousand swift elephants followed him, O king, when he<br>dwelt among the Kurus. And, O king, thirty thousand cars decked in gold<br>and drawn by the best steeds, also used to follow him then. And full<br>eight hundred bards adorned with ear-rings set with shining gems, and<br>accompanied by minstrels, recited his praises in those days, like the<br>Rishis adorning Indra. And, O king, the Kauravas and other lords of earth<br>always waited upon him like slaves, as the celestials upon Kuvera. This<br>eminent king, resembling the bright-rayed sun, made all lords of earth<br>pay tribute unto him like persons of the agricultural class. And<br>eighty-eight thousands of high-souled Snatakas depended for their<br>subsistence upon this king practising excellent vows. This illustrious<br>lord protected the aged and the helpless, the maimed and the blind, as<br>his sons, and he ruled over his subjects virtuously. Steady in morality<br>and self-control, capable of restraining his anger, bountiful, devoted to<br>the Brahmanas, and truthful, this one is the son of Pandu. The prosperity<br>and prowess of this one afflict king Suyodhana with his followers<br>including Kama and Suvala's son. And, O lord of men, the virtues of this<br>one are incapable of being enumerated. This son of Pandu is devoted to<br>morality and always abstains from injury. Possessed of such attributes,<br>doth not this bull among kings, this son of Pandu, deserve, O monarch, to<br>occupy a royal seat?'"
