                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Having speedily recovered his wealth Virata owning a<br>large army entered his city with a cheerful heart, accompanied by the<br>four Pandavas. And having vanquished the Trigartas in battle and<br>recovered all the kine, that mighty monarch, along with the sons of<br>Pritha, looked resplendent and blazed forth in beauty. And as the brave<br>king, that enhancer of the joys of friends, was seated on his throne, all<br>his subjects headed by the Brahmanas stood before him. And worshipped by<br>them, the king of the Matsyas, at the head of his army, saluted the<br>Brahmanas and his subjects in return and dismissed them cheerfully. And<br>Virata, the king of the Matsyas owning a large army, enquired after<br>Uttara, saying, 'Where hath Uttara gone?' And the women and the maidens<br>of the palace and the other females living in the inner apartments<br>joyfully said unto him, 'Our kine having been seized by the Kurus,<br>Bhuminjaya incensed at this and from excess of bravery hath issued forth<br>alone with only Vrihannala as his second, for vanquishing the six mighty<br>car-warriors, Bhishma the son of Santanu, and Kripa, and Karna, and<br>Duryodhana, and Drona, and Drona's son who have all come with the Kuru<br>army.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then king Virata, hearing that his brave son<br>had gone forth with only one car and with Vrihannala as his car-driver,<br>became filled with grief, and addressing his chief counsellors, said,<br>'Without doubt, the Kauravas and other lords of earth, learning the<br>defeat of the Trigartas, will never keep their ground. Therefore, let<br>those of my warriors that have not been wounded by the Trigartas go out,<br>accompanied by a mighty force, for the protection of Uttara.' And saying<br>this, the king speedily despatched, for the sake of his son, horses and<br>elephants and cars and a large number of foot-soldiers, equipped and<br>decked with various kinds of weapons and ornaments. And it was thus that<br>Virata, the king of the Matsyas, owning a large army, quickly ordered out<br>a large division consisting of four kinds of troops. And having done<br>this, he said, 'Learn ye, without loss of time whether the prince liveth<br>still or not! I myself think that he who hath got a person of the neuter<br>sex for his car-driver is not alive.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then king Yudhishthira the just, smilingly said<br>unto the afflicted king Virata, 'If, O monarch, Vrihannala hath been his<br>charioteer, the foe will never be able to take away thy kine today.<br>Protected by that charioteer, thy son will be able to vanquish in battle<br>all the lords of earth allied with the Kurus, indeed, even the gods and<br>the Asuras and the Siddhas and the Yakshas together.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Meanwhile, the swift-footed messengers<br>despatched by Uttara, having reached Virata's city, gave tidings of the<br>victory. And the minister-in-chief then informed the king of everything,<br>viz., the great victory that had been won, the defeat of the Kurus, and<br>the expected arrival of Uttara. And he said, 'All the kine have been<br>brought back, the Kurus have been defeated, and Uttara, that slayer of<br>foes, is well with his car-driver.' Then Yudhishthira said, 'By good luck<br>it is that the kine have been recovered and the Kurus routed. I do not,<br>however, regard it strange that thy son should have vanquished the Kurus,<br>for his victory is assured that hath Vrihannala for his charioteer.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing of the victory of his son possessed of<br>immeasurable might, king Virata became so glad that the bristles of his<br>body stood erect. And having made presents of raiments unto the<br>messengers, he ordered his ministers, saying, 'Let the highways be<br>decorated with flags, and let all the gods and goddesses be worshipped<br>with flowery offerings. And let princes and brave warriors, and musicians<br>and harlots decked in ornaments, march out to receive my son. And let the<br>bellman, speedily riding an intoxicated elephant, proclaim my victory at<br>places where four roads meet. And let Uttara, too, in gorgeous attire and<br>surrounded by virgins and chanters of eulogies, go forth to receive my<br>son.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having listened to these words of the king, all<br>the citizens with auspicious things in hand, and many amongst them with<br>cymbals and trumpets and conchs, and beautiful women attired in gorgeous<br>robes, and reciters of auspicious and sacred hymns, accompanied by<br>encomiasts and minstrels, and drummers and other kinds of musicians<br>issued forth from the city of the mighty Virata to welcome Uttara of<br>immeasurable prowess. And having despatched troops and maidens and<br>courtezens decked in ornaments, the wise king of the Matsyas cheerfully<br>said these words, 'O Sairindhri, fetch the dice. And, O Kanka, let the<br>play commence.' The son of Pandu replied, saying, 'We have heard it said<br>that one whose heart is filled with joy should not play with a cunning<br>gambler. I do not therefore, dare gamble with thee that are so<br>transported with joy. I am ever desirous of doing what is for thy good.<br>Let the play, however, commence if it pleases thee.'<br><br>"Virata said, 'My female slaves and kine, my gold and whatsoever other<br>wealth I have, nothing of all this shall thou be able to protect today<br>even if I do not gamble.' Kanka said in reply, 'O monarch, O bestower of<br>honours, what business hast thou with gamble which is attended with<br>numerous evils? Gambling is fraught with many evils; it should,<br>therefore, be shunned. Thou mayst have seen or at least heard of<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Pandu. He lost his extensive and prosperous<br>kingdom and his god-like brothers at dice. For this, I am averse to<br>gambling. But if thou likest, O king, I will play.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'While the play was going on, Matsya said unto<br>the son of Pandu, 'Lo, the Kauravas that are so formidable have been<br>vanquished in battle by my son.' Upon this, the illustrious king<br>Yudhishthira said, 'Why should not he conquer that hath Vrihannala for<br>his charioteer?'<br><br>'Thus addressed, King Matsya became angry and said unto Pandu's son,<br>'Thou wretch of a Brahmana, dost thou compare one of the neuter sex with<br>my son! Hast thou no knowledge of what is proper and what improper for<br>one to say? Without doubt, thou disregardest me. Why should not my son<br>vanquish all those with Bhishma and Drona as their leaders? O Brahmana,<br>for friendship only I pardon thee this thy offence. Thou must not,<br>however, say so again if thou wishest to live.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'There where Bhishma and Drona and Drona's son and<br>the son of Vikartana and Kripa and king Duryodhana and other royal and<br>mighty car-warriors are assembled or there where Indra himself is<br>surrounded by the Maruts, what other person than Vrihannala can fight,<br>encountering them all! None hath been, none will be, his equal in<br>strength of arms! Indeed, it is Vrihannala only whose heart is filled<br>with joy at sight of a terrible conflict. It is he who had vanquished the<br>celestials and the Asuras and human beings fighting together. With such a<br>one for his ally, why should not thy son conquer the foe? Virata said,<br>'Repeatedly forbidden by me, thou dost not yet restrain thy tongue. If<br>there is none to punish, no one would practise virtue.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Saying this, the king inflamed with anger<br>forcibly struck Yudhishthira in the face with a dice, and reproached him<br>angrily, saying, 'Let it not occur again! And having been violently<br>struck, blood began to flow from his nose. But the son of Pritha held it<br>in his hands before it fell on the ground. And the virtuous Yudhishthira<br>then glanced at Draupadi who was standing by his side. Ever obedient to<br>the wishes of her lord, the faultless Draupadi, understanding his<br>meaning, and bringing a golden vessel filled with water, received the<br>blood that flowed from his nose. Meanwhile; Uttara, entertained with<br>sweet perfumes of diverse kinds and decked with floral chaplets, slowly<br>entered the city, received with respect by the citizens, the women, and<br>the people of the provinces. And approaching the gate of the palace he<br>sent the news of his arrival to his father. And the porter then,<br>approaching the king, said, 'Thy son Uttara, waiteth at the gate with<br>Vrihannala as his companion.' And the Matsya king, with a cheerful heart,<br>said unto him, 'Do thou usher both, as I am very anxious to see them.'<br>Then Yudhishthira, the king of t e Kurus, gently whispered unto the ears<br>of the warder, 'Let Uttara enter alone; Vrihannala must not come in. Such<br>is the vow of that hero of mighty arms that whoever causeth a wound on my<br>person or sheddeth my blood except in battle, shall not live. Inflamed<br>with rage he will never bear patiently to see me bleeding, but will slay<br>Virata even now with his counsellors and troops and steeds.'"
