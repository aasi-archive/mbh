                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Marching out of the city, those heroic smiters the<br>Matsyas, arrayed in order of battle, overtook the Trigartas when the sun<br>had passed the meridian. And both excited to fury and both desirous of<br>having the king, the mighty Trigartas and the Matsyas, irrepressible in<br>battle, sent up loud roars. And then the terrible and infuriate elephants<br>ridden over by the skilful combatants of both sides were urged on with<br>spiked clubs and hooks. And the encounter, O king, that took place when<br>the sun was low in the horizon, between the infantry and cavalry and<br>chariots and elephants of both parties, was like unto that of old between<br>the gods and the Asuras, terrible and fierce and sufficient for making<br>one's hair stand on end and calculated to increase the population of<br>Yama's kingdom. And as the combatants rushed against one another, smiting<br>and slashing, thick clouds of dust began to rise, so that nothing could<br>be discovered. And covered with the dust raised by the contending armies,<br>birds began to drop down on the earth. And the sun himself disappeared<br>behind the thick cloud of arrows shot, and the firmament looked bright as<br>if with myriads of the fireflies. And shifting their bows, the staves of<br>which were decked with gold, from one hand to another, those heroes began<br>to strike each other down, discharging their arrows right and left. And<br>cars encountered cars, and foot-soldiers fought with foot-soldiers, and<br>horse-men with horsemen, and elephants with mighty elephants. And they<br>furiously encountered one another with swords and axes, bearded darts and<br>javelins, and iron clubs. And although, O king, those mighty-armed<br>warriors furiously assailed one another in that conflict, yet neither<br>party succeeded in prevailing over the other. And severed heads, some<br>with beautiful noses, some with upper lips deeply gashed, some decked<br>with ear-rings, and some divided with wounds about the well-trimmed hair<br>were seen rolling on the ground covered with dust. And soon the field of<br>battle was overspread with the limbs of Kshatriya warriors, cut off by<br>means of arrows and lying like trunks of Sala trees. And scattered over<br>with heads decked in ear-rings, and sandal-besmeared arms looking like<br>the bodies of snakes, the field of battle became exceedingly beautiful.<br>And as cars encountered cars, and horsemen encountered horsemen, and<br>foot-soldiers fought with foot-soldiers, and elephants met with<br>elephants, the frightful dust soon became drenched with torrents of<br>blood. And some amongst the combatants began to swoon away, and the<br>warriors began to fight reckless of consideration of humanity, friendship<br>and relationship. And both their course and sight obstructed by the<br>arrowy shower, vultures began to alight on the ground. But although those<br>strong-armed combatants furiously fought with one another, yet the heroes<br>of neither party succeeded in routing their antagonists. And Satanika<br>having slain a full hundred of the enemy and Visalaksha full four<br>hundred, both those mighty warriors penetrated into the heart of the<br>great Trigarta host. And having entered into the thick of the Trigarta<br>host, those famous and mighty heroes began to deprive their antagonists<br>of their senses by causing a closer conflict to set in&#8212;a conflict, in<br>which the combatants seized one another by the hair and tore one another<br>with their nails.[29] And eyeing the point where the cars of the<br>Trigartas had been mustered in strong numbers, those heroes at last<br>directed their attack towards it. And that foremost of car-warriors, king<br>Virata also, with Suryadatta in his van and Madiraksha in his rear,<br>having destroyed in that conflict five hundred cars, eight hundred<br>horses, and five warriors on great cars, displayed various skilful<br>manoeuvres on his car on that field of battle. And at last the king came<br>upon the ruler of the Trigartas mounted on a golden chariot. And those<br>high-souled and powerful warriors, desirous of fighting, rushed roaring<br>against each like two bulls in a cow-pen. Then that bull among men,<br>irrepressible in battle, Susarman, the king of the Trigartas, challenged<br>Matsya to a single combat on car. Then those warriors excited to fury<br>rushed against each other on their cars and began to shower their arrows<br>upon each other like clouds pouring torrents of rain.[30] And enraged<br>with each other, those fierce warriors, both skilled in weapons, both<br>wielding swords and darts and maces, then moved about (on the field of<br>battle) assailing each other with whetted arrows. Then king Virata<br>pierced Susarman with ten shafts and each of his four horses also with<br>five shafts. And Susarman also, irresistible in battle and conversant<br>with fatal weapons, pierced king of Matsya with fifty whetted shafts. And<br>then, O mighty monarch, in consequence of the dust on the field of<br>battle, the soldiers of both Susarman and Matsya's king could not<br>distinguish one another.'"
