                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Beholding the army of the Kurus arrayed in order of<br>battle, that descendant of the Kuru race, Partha, addressing Virata's<br>son, said, 'Do thou proceed to the spot where Kripa, the son of Saradwat,<br>is going by the southern side of that car whose flag is seen to bear the<br>device of a golden altar.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of Dhananjaya, the son of<br>Virata urged, without a moment's delay, those steeds of silvery hue<br>decked in golden armour. And making them adopt, one after another, every<br>kind of the swifter paces, he urged those fiery steeds resembling the<br>moon in colour. And versed in horse-lore, Uttara, having approached the<br>Kuru host, turned back those steeds endued with the speed of the wind.<br>And skilled in guiding vehicles, the prince of Matsya, sometimes wheeling<br>about, and sometimes proceeding in circular mazes, and sometimes turning<br>to the left, began to be wilder the Kurus. And wheeling round, the<br>intrepid and mighty son of Virata at last approached the car of Kripa,<br>and stood confronting him. Then announcing his own name, Arjuna<br>powerfully blew that best of conchs called Devadatta, of loud blare. And<br>blown on the field of battle by the mighty Jishnu, the blare of that<br>conch was heard like the splitting of a mountain. And seeing that the<br>conch did not break into a hundred fragments when blown by Arjuna, the<br>Kurus with all their warriors began to applaud it highly. And having<br>reached the very heavens, that sound coming back was heard even like the<br>crash of the thunderbolt hurled by Maghavat on the mountain breast.<br>Thereupon that heroic and intrepid and mighty car-warrior, Saradwat's son<br>Kripa, endued with strength and prowess, waxing wroth at Arjuna, and<br>unable to bear that sound and eager for fight, took up his own<br>sea-begotten conch and blew it vehemently. And filling the three worlds<br>with that sound, that foremost of car-warriors took up a large bow and<br>twanged the bow-string powerfully. And those mighty car-warriors, equal<br>unto two suns, standing opposed to each other, shone like two masses of<br>autumnal clouds. Then Saradwat's son quickly pierced Partha, that slayer<br>of hostile heroes, with ten swift and whetted arrows capable of entering<br>into the very vitals. And Pritha's son also, on his part, drawing that<br>foremost of weapons, the Gandiva, celebrated over the world, shot<br>innumerable iron-arrows, all capable of penetrating into the very core of<br>the body. Thereupon Kripa, by means of whetted shafts, cut into hundreds<br>and thousands of fragments, those blood-drinking arrows of Partha before<br>they could come up. Then that mighty car-warrior, Partha also, in wrath<br>displaying various manoeuvres, covered all sides with a shower of arrows.<br>And covering the entire welkin with his shafts, that mighty warrior of<br>immeasurable soul, the son of Pritha, enveloped Kripa with hundred of<br>shafts. And sorely afflicted by those whetted arrows resembling flames of<br>fire, Kripa waxed wroth and quickly afflicting the high-souled Partha of<br>immeasurable prowess with ten thousand shafts, set up on the field of<br>battle a loud roar. Then the heroic Arjuna quickly pierced the four<br>steeds of his adversary with four fatal arrows shot from the Gandiva,<br>sharp and straight, and furnished with golden wings. And pierced by means<br>of those whetted arrows resembling flames of fire those steeds suddenly<br>reared themselves, and in consequence Kripa reeled off his place. And<br>seeing Gautama thrown off his place, the slayer of hostile heroes, the<br>descendant of the Kuru race, out of regard for his opponent's dignity,<br>ceased to discharge his shafts at him. Then regaining his proper place,<br>Gautama quickly pierced Savyasachin with ten arrows furnished with<br>feathers of the Kanka bird. Then with a crescent-shaped arrow of keen<br>edge, Partha cut off Kripa's bow and leathern fences. And soon Partha cut<br>off Kripa's coat of mail also by means of arrows capable of penetrating<br>the very vitals, but he did not wound his person. And divested of his<br>coat of mail, his body resembled that of a serpent which hath in season<br>cast off its slough. And as soon as his bow had been cut off by Partha,<br>Gautama took up another and stringed it in a trice. And strange to say,<br>that bow of him was also cut off by Kunti's son, by means of straight<br>shafts. And in this way that slayer of hostile heroes, the son of Pandu,<br>cut off other bows as soon as they were taken up, one after another, by<br>Saradwat's son. And when all his bows were thus cut off, that mighty hero<br>hurled, from his car, at Pandu's son, a javelin like unto the blazing<br>thunderbolt. Thereupon, as the gold-decked javelin came whizzing through<br>the air with the flash of a meteor, Arjuna cut it off by means of ten<br>arrows. And beholding his dart thus cut off by the intelligent Arjuna,<br>Kripa quickly took up another bow and almost simultaneously shot a number<br>of crescent-shaped arrows. Partha, however, quickly cut them into<br>fragments by means of ten keen-edged shafts, and endued with great<br>energy, the son of Pritha then, inflamed with wrath on the field of<br>battle, discharged three and ten arrows whetted on stone and resembling<br>flames of fire. And with one of these he cut off the yoke of his<br>adversary's car, and with four pierced his four steeds, and with the<br>sixth he severed the head of his antagonist's car-driver from off his<br>body. And with three that mighty car-warrior pierced, in that encounter,<br>the triple bamboo-pole of Kripa's car and with two, its wheels. And with<br>the twelfth arrow he cut off Kripa's flagstaff. And with the thirteenth<br>Falguni, who was like Indra himself as if smiling in derision, pierced<br>Kripa in the breast. Then with his bow cut off, his car broken, his<br>steeds slain, his car-driver killed, Kripa leapt down and taking up a<br>mace quickly hurled it at Arjuna. But that heavy and polished mace hurled<br>by Kripa was sent back along its course, struck by means of Arjuna's<br>arrows. And then the warriors (of Kripa's division), desirous of rescuing<br>wrathful son of Saradwat encountered Partha from all sides and covered<br>him with their arrows. Then the son of Virata, turning the steed to the<br>left began to perform circuitous evolution called Yamaka and thus<br>withstood all those warriors. And those illustrious bulls among men,<br>taking Kripa with them who had been deprived of his car, led him away<br>from the vicinity of Dhananiaya, the son of Kunti.'"
