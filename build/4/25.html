                            "Vaisampayana said, 'At the slaughter of Kichaka and brothers, people, O<br>king, thinking of this terrible feat, were filled with surprise. And in<br>the city and the provinces it was generally bruited about that for<br>bravery the king's Vallava and Kichaka were both mighty warriors. The<br>wicked Kichaka, however, had been an oppressor of men and a dishonourer<br>of other people's wives. And it was for this that wicked of sinful soul<br>had been slain by the Gandharvas. And it was thus, O king, that people<br>began to speak, from province to province of the invincible Kichaka, that<br>slayer of hostile ranks.<br><br>'Meanwhile, the spies employed by Dhritarashtra's son, having searched<br>various villages and towns and kingdoms and done all that they had been<br>commanded to do and completed their examination, in the manner directed,<br>of the countries indicated in their orders, returned to Nagarupa,<br>gratified with at least one thing that they had learnt.[20] And seeing<br>Dhritarashtra's son king Duryodhana of the Kuru race seated in his court<br>with Drona and Karna and Kripa, with the high-souled Bhishma, his own<br>brothers, and those great warriors&#8212;the Trigartas, they addressed him,<br>saying, 'O lord of men, great hath been the care always bestowed by us in<br>the search after the sons of Pandu in that mighty forest. Searched have<br>we through the solitary wilderness abounding with deer and other animals<br>and overgrown with trees and creepers of diverse kind. Searched have we<br>also in arbours of matted woods and plants and creepers of every species,<br>but we have failed in discovering that track by which Pritha's son of<br>irrepressible energy may have gone. Searched have we in these and other<br>places for their foot-prints. Searched have we closely, O king, on<br>mountain tops and in inaccessible fastnesses, in various kingdoms and<br>provinces teeming with people, in encampments and cities. No trace have<br>yet been found of the sons of Pandu. Good betide thee, O bull among men,<br>it seems that they have perished without leaving a mark behind. O<br>foremost of warriors, although we followed in the track of those<br>warriors, yet, O best of men, we soon lost their footprints and do not<br>know their present residence. O lord of men, for some time we followed in<br>the wake of their charioteers. And making our inquiries duly, we truly<br>ascertained what we desired to know. O slayer of foes, the charioteers<br>reached Dwaravati without the sons of Pritha among them. O king, neither<br>the sons of Pandu, nor the chaste Krishna, are in that city of Yadavas. O<br>bull of the Bharata race, we have not been able to discover either their<br>track or their present abode. Salutations to thee, they are gone for<br>good. We are acquainted with the disposition of the sons of Pandu and<br>know something of the feats achieved by them. It behoveth thee,<br>therefore, O lord of men, to give us instructions, O monarch, as to what<br>we should next do in the search after the sons of Pandu. O hero, listen<br>also to these agreeable words of ours, promising great good to thee. King<br>Matsya's commander, Kichaka of wicked soul, by whom the Trigartas, O<br>monarch, were repeatedly vanquished and slain with mighty force, now<br>lieth low on the ground with all his brothers, slain, O monarch, by<br>invisible Gandharvas during the hours of darkness, O thou of unfading<br>glory. Having heard this delightful news about the discomfiture of our<br>enemies, we have been exceedingly gratified, O Kauravya. Do thou now<br>ordain what should next be done.'"
