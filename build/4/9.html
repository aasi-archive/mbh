                            Vaisampayana said, "Binding her black, soft, fine, long and faultless<br>tresses with crisped ends into a knotted braid, Draupadi of black eyes<br>and sweet smiles, throwing it upon her right shoulders, concealed it by<br>her cloth. And she wore a single piece of a black and dirty though costly<br>cloth. And dressing herself as a Sairindhri, she began to wander hither<br>and thither in seeming affliction. And beholding her wandering, men and<br>women came to her hastily and addressed her, saying, 'Who are you? And<br>what do you seek?' And she replied, 'I am a king's Sairindhri. I desire<br>to serve any one that will maintain me.' But beholding her beauty and<br>dress, and hearing also her speech that was so sweet, the people could<br>not take her for a maid-servant in search of subsistence. And it came to<br>pass that while looking this way and that from the terrace, Virata's<br>beloved queen, daughter of the king of Kekaya, saw Draupadi. And<br>beholding her forlorn and clad in a single piece of cloth, the queen<br>addressed her saying, 'O beautiful one, who are you, and what do you<br>seek?' Thereupon, Draupadi answered her, saying, 'O foremost of queen, I<br>am Sairindhri. I will serve anybody that will maintain me.' Then Sudeshna<br>said, 'What you say (regarding your profession) can never be compatible<br>with so much beauty. (On the contrary) you might well be the mistress of<br>servants both, male and female. Your heels are not prominent, and your<br>thighs touch each other. And your intelligence is great, and your navel<br>deep, and your words solemn. And your great toes, and bust and hips, and<br>back and sides, and toe-nails, and palms are all well-developed. And your<br>palms, soles, and face are ruddy. And your speech is sweet even as the<br>voice of the swan. And your hair is beautiful, and your bust shapely, and<br>you are possessed of the highest grace. And your hips and bust are plump.<br>And like a Kashmerean mare you are furnished with every auspicious mark.<br>And your eye-lashes are (beautiful) bent, and your nether-lip is like the<br>ruddy ground. And your waist is slender, and your neck bears lines that<br>resemble those of the conch. And your veins are scarcely visible. Indeed,<br>your countenance is like the full moon, and your eyes resemble the leaves<br>of the autumnal lotus, and your body is fragrant as the lotus itself.<br>Verily, in beauty you resemble Sri herself, whose seat is the autumnal<br>lotus. Tell me, O beautiful damsel, who thou art. Thou canst never be a<br>maidservant. Art thou a Yakshi, a Goddess, a Gandharvi, or an Apsara? Art<br>thou the daughter of a celestial, or art thou a female Naga? Art thou the<br>guardian goddess of some city, a Vidyadhari, or a Kinnari,&#8212;or art thou<br>Rohini herself? Or art thou Alamvusha, or Misrakesi, Pundarika, or<br>Malini, or the queen of Indra, or of Varuna? Or, art thou the spouse of<br>Viswakarma, or of the creative Lord himself? Of these goddesses who art<br>renowned in the celestial regions, who art thou, O graceful one?'<br><br>"Draupadi replied, 'O auspicious lady, I am neither a goddess nor a<br>Gandharvi, nor a Yakshi, nor a Rakshasi. I am a maid-servant of the<br>Sairindhri class. I tell thee this truly. I know to dress the hair to<br>pound (fragrant substances) for preparing unguents, and also to make<br>beautiful and variegated garlands. O beauteous lady, of jasmines and<br>lotuses and blue lilies and Champakas. Formerly I served Krishna's<br>favourite queen Satyabhama, and also Draupadi, the wife of the Pandavas<br>and the foremost beauty of the Kuru race. I wander about alone, earning<br>good food and dress; and as long as I get these, I continue to live in<br>the place where they are obtainable. Draupadi herself called me Malini<br>(maker of garlands).'<br><br>"Hearing this, Sudeshna said, 'I would keep thee upon my head itself, if<br>the doubt did not cross my mind that the king himself would be attracted<br>towards thee with his whole heart. Attracted by thy beauty, the females<br>of the royal household and my maids are looking at thee. What male person<br>then is there that can resist thy attraction? Surely, O thou of<br>well-rounded hips, O damsel of exquisite charms, beholding thy form of<br>superhuman beauty, king Virata is sure to forsake me, and will turn to<br>thee with his whole heart. O thou of faultless limbs, O thou that art<br>endued with large eyes casting quick glances, he upon whom thou wilt look<br>with desire is sure to be stricken. O thou of sweet smiles, O thou that<br>possessest a faultless form, he that will behold thee constantly, will<br>surely catch the flame. Even as a person that climbs up a tree for<br>compassing his own destruction, even as the crab conceives for her own<br>ruin, I may, O thou of sweet smiles, bring destruction upon myself by<br>harbouring thee.'<br><br>"Draupadi replied, 'O fair lady, neither Virata nor any other person will<br>be able to have me, for my five youthful husbands, who are Gandharvas and<br>sons of a Gandharva king of exceeding power, always protect me. None can<br>do me a wrong. It is the wish of my Gandharva husbands that I should<br>serve only such persons as will not give me to touch food already<br>partaken of by another, or tell me to wash their feet. Any man that<br>attempts to have me like any common woman, meeteth with death that very<br>night. No one can succeed in having me, for, O beautiful lady, O thou of<br>sweet smiles, those beloved Gandharvas, possessed of great energy and<br>mighty strength always protect me secretly.'<br><br>"Sudeshna said, 'O thou that bringest delight to the heart, if it is as<br>thou sayest, I will take thee into my household. Thou shalt not have to<br>touch food that hath been partaken of by another, or to wash another's<br>feet.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by Virata's wife, O Janamejaya,<br>Krishna (Draupadi) ever devoted to her lords, began to live in that city.<br>Nor could anyone ascertain who in reality she was!'"
