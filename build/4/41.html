Born in the Kshatriya order, and the son of a great king, and<br>always observant of mantras and vows, it is not becoming of me to touch<br>it. Why shouldst thou, O Vrihannala, make me a polluted and unclean<br>bearer of corpses, by compelling me to come in contact with a corpse?'<br><br>"Vrihannala said, 'Thou shalt, O king of kings, remain clean and<br>unpolluted. Do not fear, there are only bows in this tree and not<br>corpses. Heir to the king of the Matsyas, and born in a noble family, why<br>should I, O prince, make thee do such a reproachable deed?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Thus addressed by Partha, Virata's son, decked in<br>ear-rings, alighted from the car, and climbed up that Sami tree<br>reluctantly. And staying on the car, Dhananjaya, that slayer of enemies,<br>said, unto him, 'Speedily bring thou down those bows from the top of the<br>tree. And cutting off their wrappings first and then the ropes with which<br>they were tied, the prince beheld the Gandiva there along with four other<br>bows. And as they were united, the splendour of those bows radiant as the<br>sun, began to shine with great effulgence like unto that of the planets<br>about the time of their rising. And beholding the forms of those bows, so<br>like unto sighing snakes, he become afflicted with fear and in a moment<br>the bristles of his body stood on their ends. And touching those large<br>bows of great splendour, Virata's son, O king, thus spake unto Arjuna!'"
