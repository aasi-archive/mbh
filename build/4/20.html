                            "Draupadi said, 'Alas, on account of that desperate gambler, I am now<br>under Sudeshna's command, living in the palace in the guise of a<br>Sairindhri. And, O chastiser of foes, behold the plight of poignant woe<br>which I, a princess, am now in. I am living in expectation of the close<br>of this stated period.[14] The extreme of misery, therefore, is mine.<br>Success of purpose, victory, and defeat, as regards mortals, are<br>transitory. It is in this belief that I am living in expectation of the<br>return of prosperity to my husbands. Prosperity and adversity revolve<br>like a wheel. It is in this belief that I am living in expectation of the<br>return of prosperity to my husbands. That cause which bringeth on<br>victory, may bring defeat as well. I live in this hope. Why dost thou<br>not, O Bhimasena, regard me as one dead? I have heard that persons that<br>give may beg: that they who slay may be slain; and that they who<br>over-throw others may themselves be overthrown by foes. Nothing is<br>difficult for Destiny and none can over-ride Destiny. It is for this that<br>I am awaiting the return of favourable fortune. As a tank once dried, is<br>filled up once again, so hoping for a change for the better, I await the<br>return of prosperity. When one's business that hath been well-provided<br>for is seen to be frustrated, a truly wise person should never strive for<br>bringing back good fortune. Plunged as I am an sorrow, asked or unasked<br>by thee to explain the purpose of these words spoken by me, I shall tell<br>thee everything. Queen of the sons of Pandu and daughter of Drupada, who<br>else, save myself, would wish to live, having fallen into such a plight?<br>O represser of foes, the misery, therefore, that hath overtaken me, hath<br>really humiliated the entire Kuru race, the Panchalas, and the sons of<br>Pandu. Surrounded by numerous brothers and father-in-law and sons, what<br>other woman having such cause for joy, save myself, would be afflicted<br>with such woe? Surely, I must, in my childhood, have committed act highly<br>offensive to Dhatri through whose displeasure, O bull of the Bharata<br>race, I have been visited with such consequences. Mark, O son of Pandu,<br>the pallour that hath come over my complexion which not even a life in<br>the woods fraught as it was with extreme misery, could bring about. Thou,<br>O Pritha's son, knowest what happiness, O Bhima, was formerly mine. Even,<br>I, who was such have now sunk into servitude. Sorely distressed, I can<br>find no rest. That the mighty-armed and terrible bowman, Dhananjaya the<br>son of Pritha, should now live like a fire that hath been put out, maketh<br>me think of all this as attributable to Destiny. Surely, O son of Pritha,<br>it is impossible for men to understand the destinies of creatures (in<br>this world). I, therefore, think this downfall of yours as something that<br>could not be averted by forethought. Alas, she who hath you all, that<br>resemble Indra himself to attend to her comforts&#8212;even she, so chaste and<br>exalted, hath now to attend to the comforts of others, that are to her<br>far inferior in rank. Behold, O Pandava, my plight. It is what I do not<br>deserve. You are alive, yet behold this inversion of order that time hath<br>brought. She who had the whole Earth to the verge of the sea under her<br>control, is now under the control of Sudeshna and living in fear of her.<br>She who had dependants to walk both before and behind her, alas, now<br>herself walketh before and behind Sudeshna. This, O Kaunteya, is another<br>grief of mine that is intolerable. O, listen to it. She who had never,<br>save for Kunti, pounded unguents even for her own use, now, good betide<br>thee, poundeth sandal (for others). O Kaunteya, behold these hands of<br>mine which were not so before. Saying this she showed him her hands<br>marked with corns. And she continued, she who had never feared Kunti<br>herself nor thee and thy brothers, now standeth in fear before Virata as<br>a slave, anxious of what that king of kings may say unto her regarding<br>the proper preparation of the unguents, for Matsya liketh not sandal<br>pounded by others.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Relating her woes thus, O Bharata, unto<br>Bhimasena, Krishna began to weep silently, casting her eyes on Bhima. And<br>then, with words choked in tears, and sighing repeatedly, she addressed<br>Bhima in these words, powerfully stirring his heart, 'Signal, O Bhima,<br>must have been my offence of old unto the gods, for, unfortunate as I am.<br>I am yet alive, when, O Pandava, I should die.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then that slayer of hostile heroes, Vrikodara,<br>covering his face with those delicate hands of his wife marked with<br>corns, began to weep. And that mighty son of Kunti, holding the hands of<br>Draupadi in his, shed copious tears. And afflicted with great woe, he<br>spoke these words.'"
