                            (Pandava-Pravesa Parva)<br><br>OM! Having bowed down to Narayana, and Nara, the most exalted of male<br>beings, and also to the goddess Saraswati, must the word Jaya be uttered.<br><br>Janamejaya said, "How did my great-grandfathers, afflicted with the fear<br>of Duryodhana, pass their days undiscovered in the city of Virata? And, O<br>Brahman, how did the highly blessed Draupadi, stricken with woe, devoted<br>to her lords, and ever adoring the Deity[1], spend her days unrecognised?"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Listen, O lord of men, how thy great grandfathers<br>passed the period of unrecognition in the city of Virata. Having in this<br>way obtained boons from the god of Justice, that best of virtuous men,<br>Yudhishthira, returned to the asylum and related unto the Brahmanas all<br>that had happened. And having related everything unto them, Yudhishthira<br>restored to that regenerate Brahmana, who had followed him the churning<br>staff and the fire-sticks he had lost. And, O Bharata, the son of the god<br>of Justice, the royal Yudhishthira of high soul then called together all<br>his younger brothers and addressed them, saying, 'Exiled from our<br>kingdom, we have passed twelve years. The thirteenth year, hard to spend,<br>hath now come. Do thou therefore, O Arjuna, the son of Kunti, select some<br>spot where we may pass our days undiscovered by our enemies.'"<br><br>Arjuna replied, "Even by virtue of Dharma's boon, we shall, O lord of<br>men, range about undiscovered by men. Still, for purposes of residence, I<br>shall mention some spots that are both delightful and secluded. Do thou<br>select some one of them. Surrounding the kingdom of the Kurus, are, many<br>countries beautiful and abounding in corn, such as Panchala, Chedi,<br>Matsya, Surasena, Pattachchara, Dasarna, Navarashtra, Malla, Salva,<br>Yugandhara, Saurashtra, Avanti, and the spacious Kuntirashtra. Which of<br>these, O king, wouldst thou choose, and where, O foremost of monarchs,<br>shall we spend this year?"<br><br>Yudhishthira said "O them of mighty arms, it is even so. What that<br>adorable Lord of all creatures hath said must become true. Surely, after<br>consulting together, we must select some delightful, auspicious, and<br>agreeable region for our abode, where we may live free from fear. The<br>aged Virata, king of the Matsyas, is virtuous and powerful and<br>charitable, and is liked by all. And he is also attached to the Pandavas.<br>Even in the city of Virata, O child, we shall, O Bharata, spend this<br>year, entering his service. Tell me, ye sons of the Kuru race, in what<br>capacities ye will severally present yourselves before the king of the<br>Matsyas!"<br><br>Arjuna said, "O god among men, what service wilt thou take in Virata's<br>kingdom? O righteous one, in what capacity wilt thou reside in the city<br>of Virata? Thou art mild, and charitable, and modest, and virtuous, and<br>firm in promise. What wilt thou, O king, afflicted as thou art with<br>calamity, do? A king is qualified to bear trouble like an ordinary<br>person. How wilt thou overcome this great calamity that has overtaken<br>thee?"<br><br>Yudhishthira replied, "Ye sons of the Kuru race, ye bulls among men, hear<br>what I shall do on appearing before king Virata. Presenting myself as a<br>Brahmana, Kanka by name, skilled in dice and fond of play, I shall become<br>a courtier of that high-souled king. And moving upon chess-boards<br>beautiful pawns made of ivory, of blue and yellow and red and white hue,<br>by throws of black and red dice. I shall entertain the king with his<br>courtiers and friends. And while I shall continue to thus delight the<br>king, nobody will succeed in discovering me. And should the monarch ask<br>me, I shall say, 'Formerly I was the bosom friend of Yudhishthira.' I<br>tell you that it is thus that I shall pass my days (in the city of<br>Virata). What office wilt thou, O Vrikodara, fill in the city of Virata?"
