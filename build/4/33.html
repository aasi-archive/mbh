                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Then, O Bharata, when the world was enveloped in<br>dust and the gloom of night, the warriors of both sides, without breaking<br>the order of battle, desisted for a while.[31] And then, dispelling the<br>darkness the moon arose illumining the night and gladdening the hearts of<br>the Kshatriya warriors. And when everything became visible, the battle<br>once more began. And it raged on so furiously that the combatants could<br>not distinguish one another. And then Trigarta's lord, Susarman with his<br>younger brother, and accompanied by all his cars, rushed towards the king<br>of Matsya. And descending from their cars, those bulls among Kshatriyas,<br>the (royal) brothers, mace in hand, rushed furiously towards the cars of<br>the foe. And the hostile hosts fiercely assailed each other with maces<br>and swords and scimitars, battle-axes and bearded darts with keen edges<br>and points of excellent temper. And king Susarman, the lord of the<br>Trigartas having by his energy oppressed and defeated the whole army of<br>the Matsyas, impetuously rushed towards Virata himself endued with great<br>energy. And the two brothers having severally slain Virata's two steeds<br>and his charioteer, as also those soldiers that protected his rear, took<br>him captive alive, when deprived of his car. Then afflicting him sorely,<br>like a lustful man afflicting a defenceless damsel, Susarman placed<br>Virata on his own car, and speedily rushed out of the field. And when the<br>powerful Virata, deprived of his car, was taken captive, the Matsyas,<br>harrassed solely by the Trigartas, began to flee in fear in all<br>directions. And beholding them panic-stricken, Kunti's son, Yudhishthira,<br>addressed that subduer of foes, the mighty-armed Bhima, saying, 'The king<br>of the Matsyas hath been taken by the Trigartas. Do thou, O mighty-armed<br>one, rescue him, so that he may not fall under the power of the enemy. As<br>we have lived happily in Virata's city, having every desire of ours<br>gratified, it behoveth thee, O Bhimasena, to discharge that debt (by<br>liberating the king).' Thereat Bhimasena replied, 'I will liberate him, O<br>king, at thy command. Mark the feat I achieve (today) in battling with<br>the foe, relying solely on the might of my arms. Do thou, O king, stay<br>aside, along with our brothers and witness my prowess today. Uprooting<br>this mighty tree of huge trunk looking like a mace, I will rout the<br>enemy.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Beholding Bhima casting his eyes on that tree<br>like a mad elephant, the heroic king Yudhishthira the just spake unto his<br>brother, saying, 'Do not, O Bhima, commit such a rash act. Let the tree<br>stand there. Thou must not achieve such feats in a super-human manner by<br>means of that tree, for if thou dost, the people, O Bharata, will<br>recognise thee and say, This is Bhima. Take thou, therefore, some human<br>weapon such as a bow (and arrows), or a dart, or a sword, or a<br>battle-axe. And taking therefore, O Bhima, some weapon that is human,<br>liberate thou the king without giving anybody the means of knowing thee<br>truly. The twins endued with great strength will defend thy wheels.<br>Fighting together, O child, liberate the king of the Matsyas!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed, the mighty Bhimasena endued<br>with great speed, quickly took up an excellent bow and impetuously shot<br>from it a shower of arrows, thick as the downpour of a rain-charged<br>cloud. And Bhima then rushed furiously towards Susarman of terrible<br>deeds, and assuring Virata with the words&#8212;O good king![32] said unto the<br>lord of the Trigartas,&#8212;Stay! Stay! Seeing Bhima like unto Yama himself<br>in his rear, saying, Stay! Stay! Do thou witness this mighty feat,&#8212;this<br>combat that is at hand!&#8212;the bull among warriors, Susarman, seriously<br>considered (the situation), and taking up his bow turned back, along with<br>his brothers. Within the twinkling of an eye, Bhima destroyed those cars<br>that sought to oppose him. And soon again hundreds of thousands of cars<br>and elephants and horses and horsemen and brave and fierce bowmen were<br>overthrown by Bhima in the very sight of Virata. And the hostile infantry<br>also began to be slaughtered by the illustrious Bhima, mace in hand. And<br>beholding that terrible onslaught, Susarman, irrepressible in fight,<br>thought within himself, 'My brother seems to have already succumbed in<br>the midst of his mighty host. Is my army going to be annihilated?' And<br>drawing his bow-string to his ear Susarman then turned back and began to<br>shoot keen-edged shafts incessantly. And seeing the Pandavas return to<br>the charge on their car, the Matsya warriors of mighty host, urging on<br>their steeds, shot excellent weapons for grinding the Trigarta soldiers.<br>And Virata's son also, exceedingly exasperated began to perform<br>prodigious fears of valour. And Kunti's son Yudhishthira slew a thousand<br>(of the foe), and Bhima showed the abode of Yama unto seven thousand. And<br>Nakula sent seven hundred (to their last account) by means of his shafts.<br>And powerful Sahadeva also, commanded by Yudhishthira, slew three hundred<br>brave warriors. And having slain such numbers, that fierce and mighty<br>warrior, Yudhishthira, with weapons upraised, rushed against Susarman.<br>And rushing impetuously at Susarman, that foremost of car-warriors, king<br>Yudhishthira, assailed him with vollies of shafts. And Susarman also, in<br>great rage, quickly pierced Yudhishthira with nine arrows, and each of<br>his four steeds with four arrows. Then, O king, Kunti's son Bhima of<br>quick movements, approaching Susarman crushed his steeds. And having<br>slain also those soldiers that protected his rear, he dragged from the<br>car his antagonist's charioteer to the ground. And seeing the king of<br>Trigarta's car without a driver, the defender of his car-wheels, the<br>famous and brave Madiraksha speedily came to his aid. And thereat,<br>leaping down from Susarman's car, and securing the latter's mace the<br>powerful Virata ran in pursuit of him. And though old, he moved on the<br>field, mace in hand, even like a lusty youth. And beholding Susarman flee<br>Bhima addressed him, saying, 'Desist, O Prince! This flight of thine is<br>not proper! With this prowess of thine, how couldst thou wish to carry<br>off the cattle by force? How also, forsaking thy follower, dost thou<br>droop so amidst foes? Thus addressed by Pritha's son, the mighty<br>Susarman, that lord of countless cars saying unto Bhima, Stay!<br>Stay!&#8212;suddenly turned round and rushed at him. Then Bhima, the son of<br>Pandu, leaping down from his car, as he alone could do,[33] rushed<br>forward with great coolness, desirous of taking Susarman's life. And<br>desirous of seizing Trigarta's king advancing towards him, the mighty<br>Bhimasena rushed impetuously towards him, even like a lion rushing at a<br>small deer. And advancing impetuously, the mighty-armed Bhima seized<br>Susarman by the hair, and lifting him up in wrath, dashed him down on the<br>ground. And as he lay crying in agony, the mighty-armed Bhima kicked him<br>at the head, and placing his knee on his breast dealt him severe blows.<br>And sorely afflicted with that kicking, the king of Trigartas became<br>senseless. And when the king of the Trigartas deprived of his car, had<br>been seized thus, the whole Trigarta army stricken with panic, broke and<br>fled in all directions, and the mighty sons of Pandu, endued with modesty<br>and observant of vows and relying on the might of their own arms, after<br>having vanquished Susarman, and rescued the kine as well as other kinds<br>of wealth and having thus dispelled Virata's anxiety, stood together<br>before that monarch. And Bhimasena then said, 'This wretch given to<br>wicked deeds doth not deserve to escape me with life. But what can I do?<br>The king is so lenient!' And then taking Susarman by the neck as he was<br>lying on the ground insensible and covered with dust, and binding him<br>fast, Pritha's son Vrikodara placed him on his car, and went to where<br>Yudhishthira was staying in the midst of the field. And Bhima then showed<br>Susarman unto the monarch. And beholding Susarman in that plight, that<br>tiger among men king Yudhishthira smilingly addressed Bhima&#8212;that<br>ornament of battle,&#8212;saying, 'Let this worst of men be set free.' Thus<br>addressed, Bhima spoke unto the mighty Susarman, saying, 'If, O wretch,<br>thou wishest to live, listen to those words of mine. Thou must say in<br>every court and assembly of men,&#8212;I am a slave. On this condition only I<br>will grant thee thy life. Verily, this is the law about the vanquished.'<br>Thereupon his elder brother affectionately addressed Bhima, saying, 'If<br>thou regardest us as an authority, liberate this wicked wight. He hath<br>already become king Virata's slave. And turning then to Susarman, he<br>said, 'Thou art freed. Go thou a free man, and never act again in this<br>way.'"
