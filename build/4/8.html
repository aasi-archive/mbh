                            Vaisampayana said, "Then another endued with the dreadful strength and<br>blazing in beauty, approached king Virata, with the playful gait of the<br>lion. And holding in hand a cooking ladle and a spoon, as also an<br>unsheathed sword of sable hue and without a spot on the blade, he came in<br>the guise of a cook illumining all around him by his splendour like the<br>sun discovering the whole world. And attired in black and possessed of<br>the strength of the king of mountains, he approached the king of the<br>Matsyas and stood before him. And beholding that king-like person before<br>him, Virata addressed his assembled subjects saying, 'Who is that youth,<br>that bull among men, with shoulders broad like those of a lion, and so<br>exceedingly beautiful? That person, never seen before, is like the sun.<br>Revolving the matter in my mind, I cannot ascertain who he is, nor can I<br>with even serious thoughts guess the intention of that bull among men (in<br>coming here). Beholding him, it seems to me that he is either the king of<br>the Gandharvas, or Purandara himself. Do ye ascertain who it is that<br>standeth before my eyes. Let him have quickly what he seeks.' Thus<br>commanded by king Virata, his swift-footed messengers went up to the son<br>of Kunti and informed that younger brother of Yudhishthira of everything<br>the king had said. Then the high-souled son of Pandu, approaching Virata,<br>addressed him in words that were not unsuited to his object, saying, 'O<br>foremost of kings, I am a cook, Vallava by name. I am skilled in dressing<br>dishes. Do thou employ me in the kitchen!'"<br><br>Virata said, "I do not believe, O Vallava, that cooking is thy office.<br>Thou resemblest the deity of a thousand eyes; and in grace and beauty and<br>prowess, thou shinest among these all as a king!"<br><br>Bhima replied, "O king of kings, I am thy cook and servant in the first<br>place. It is not curries only of which I have knowledge, O monarch,<br>although king Yudhishthira always used in days gone by to taste my<br>dishes. O lord of earth, I am also a wrestler. Nor is there one that is<br>equal to me in strength. And engaging in fight with lions and elephants,<br>I shall, O sinless one, always contribute to thy entertainment."<br><br>Virata said, "I will even grant thee boons. Thou wilt do what thou<br>wishest, as thou describest thyself skilled in it. I do not, however,<br>think, that this office is worthy of thee, for thou deservest this<br>(entire) earth girt round by the sea. But do as thou likest. Be thou the<br>superintendent of my kitchen, and thou art placed at the head of those<br>who have been appointed there before by me."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus appointed in the kitchen, Bhima soon became<br>the favourite of king Virata. And, O king, he continued to live there<br>unrecognised by the other servants of Virata as also by other people!"
