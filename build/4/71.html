                            "Virata said, 'If this one, indeed, be the Kuru king Yudhisthira the son<br>of Kunti, which amongst these is his brother Arjuna, and which, the<br>mighty Bhima. Which of these is Nakula, and which Sahadeva and where is<br>the celebrated Draupadi? After their defeat at dice, the sons of Pritha<br>have not been heard of by any one.'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'Even this one, O king, who is called Vallava and is thy<br>cook, is that Bhima of mighty arms and terrible prowess and furious<br>impetus. It was he who slew the furious Rakshasas on the mountains of<br>Gandhamadana, and procured for Krishna celestial flowers of great<br>fragrance. Even he is that Gandharva, who slew the Kichaka of wicked soul<br>and it was he who killed tigers and bears and boars in the inner<br>apartment of thy palace. He who had been the keeper of thy horse is that<br>slayer of foes called Nakula, and this one is Sahadeva, the keeper of thy<br>kine. Both these sons of Madri are great car-warriors, possessed of great<br>fame and beauty of person. These two bulls of the Bharata race, attired<br>in handsome robes and decked in excellent ornaments, are a match for a<br>thousand great car-warriors. And even this lady of eyes like lotus-petals<br>and slender-waist and sweet smiles is Drupada's daughter, thy wife's<br>Sairindhri, for whose sake, O king, the Kichakas were slain. I am, O<br>king, Arjuna who, it is evident, thou hast heard, is that son of Pritha,<br>who is Bhima's junior and the senior of the twins! We have, O king,<br>happily passed in thy abode the period of non-discovery, like infants in<br>the womb!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'After Arjuna had pointed out those heroes&#8212;the<br>five Pandavas, the son of Virata then spoke of Arjuna's prowess. And<br>Uttara once again identified the sons of Pritha. And the prince said,<br>'That one whose complexion is bright like that of pure gold, who is stout<br>like a full-grown lion, whose nose is so prominent, whose eyes are large<br>and expansive, and whose face is broad and of coppery hue, is the king of<br>the Kurus. And behold, that one whose tread is like that of an infuriate<br>elephant, whose complexion is like that of heated gold, whose shoulders<br>are broad and expanded, and whose arms are long and thick, is Vrikodara.<br>And he who stands by his side, that youth of darkish hue, who is like<br>unto a leader of a herd of elephants, whose shoulders are broad like<br>those of a lion, whose tread is like that of a mighty elephant, and whose<br>eyes are large and expansive like lotus-leaves, is Arjuna that foremost<br>of bowmen. All lo, close to the king, are those foremost of men, the<br>twins, like unto Vishnu and Indra, and who have no equals, in the world<br>of men, in beauty, might, and behaviour. And close by them, behold,<br>standeth Krishna, beautiful as gold, like unto the very embodiment of<br>light, possessing the complexion of the blue lotus, like unto a celestial<br>damsel, and resembling the living embodiment of Lakshmi herself.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then Virata's son began to describe the prowess<br>of Arjuna, saying, 'Even this one is he that slew the foe, like unto a<br>lion devastating a flock of deer. Even he ranged through, crowds of<br>hostile cars, slaying their best of car-warriors. By him was slain a<br>huge, infuriate elephant by means of a single arrow. Pierced by him, that<br>huge beast having its flanks adorned with an armour of gold, fell down<br>piercing the earth with his tusks. By him have the kine been recovered<br>and the Kauravas vanquished in battle. My ears have been deafened by the<br>blare of his conch. It was by this hero of fierce deeds that Bhishma and<br>Drona, along with Duryodhana, were vanquished. That achievement is his<br>and not mine.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of his, the mighty king of<br>the Matsyas, considering himself guilty of having offended Yudhishthira,<br>said unto Uttara in reply, 'I think the time hath come for me to<br>propitiate the sons of Pandu. And, if thou likest, I shall bestow my<br>daughter Uttara upon Arjuna.'<br><br>"Uttara said, 'Worthy of our adorations and worship and respect, the time<br>hath come for worshipping the illustrious sons of Pandu who deserve to be<br>worshipped by us.'<br><br>"Virata said, 'When brought under the foe's subjection in battle, it was<br>Bhimasena that rescued me. My kine also have been recovered by Arjuna. It<br>is through the might of their arms that we have obtained victory in<br>battle. Such being the case, all of us, with our counsellors, shall<br>propitiate Yudhishthira the son of Kunti. Blessed be thou, with all thy<br>brothers, O bull among the sons of Pandu. If, O king, we have ever said<br>or done anything in ignorance to offend thee, it behoveth thee to forgive<br>us. The son of Pandu is virtuous.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then the high-souled Virata, delighted greatly,<br>approached king Yudhishthira and made an alliance with him, and offered<br>him his whole kingdom together with the sceptre and treasury and<br>metropolis. And addressing all the Pandavas, and especially Dhananjaya,<br>the mighty king of the Matsyas repeatedly said, 'By good luck it is that<br>I see you.' And having again and again embraced Yudhishthira and Bhima<br>and the sons of Madri, and smelt their heads, Virata, that owner of a<br>large army, was not satiated with gazing at them. And being highly<br>pleased, he said unto king Yudhishthira, 'By good luck it is that I see<br>you safe from woods. By good luck it is that ye have accomplished with<br>difficulty the period of exile, undiscovered by those wicked wights. I<br>make over my entire kingdom to the sons of Pritha, and what else I have.<br>Let the sons of Pandu accept these without the slightest hesitation. And<br>let Dhananjaya, called also Savyasachin, accept the hand of Uttara: for<br>that best of men is fit to be her lord.' Thus addressed, king<br>Yudhishthira the just cast a look upon Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha. And<br>looked at by his brother, Arjuna said unto the Matsya king, 'O monarch, I<br>accept thy daughter as my daughter-in-law. And alliance of this kind<br>between the Matsya and the Bharatas is, indeed, desirable.'"
