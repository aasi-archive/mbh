                            "Vaisampayana said, 'After Bhishma had fled, leaving the van of battle,<br>the illustrious son of Dhritarashtra hoisting high flag approached<br>Arjuna, bow in hand and setting up a loud roar. And with a spear-headed<br>shaft shot from his bow stretched to the ear, he pierced on the forehead<br>of that terrible bowman of fierce prowess, Dhanajaya, ranging amidst the<br>foes. And pierced with that keen shaft of golden point on the forehead,<br>that hero of famous deeds looked resplendent, O king, like unto a<br>beautiful hill with a single peak. And cut by that arrow, the warm<br>life-blood gushed out profusely from the wound. And the blood trickling<br>down his body shone beautifully like a wreath of golden flowers. And<br>struck by Duryodhana with the shaft, the swift-handed Arjuna of unfailing<br>strength, swelling with rage, pierced the king in return, taking up<br>arrows that were endued with the energy of snakes of virulent poison. And<br>Duryodhana of formidable energy attacked Partha, and Partha also, that<br>foremost of heroes, attacked Duryodhana. And it was that those foremost<br>of men, both born in the race of Ajamida, struck each other alike in the<br>combat. And then (seated) on an infuriate elephant huge as a mountain and<br>supported by four cars, Vikarna rushed against Jishnu, the son of Kunti.<br>And beholding that huge elephant, advancing with speed, Dhananjaya struck<br>him on the head between the temples with an iron arrow of great impetus<br>shot from the bow-string stretched to the ear. And like the thunderbolt<br>hurled by Indra splitting a mountain, that arrow furnished with vulturine<br>wings, shot by Partha, penetrated, up to the very feathers, into the body<br>of that elephant huge as hill. And sorely afflicted by the shaft, that<br>lord of the elephant species began to tremble, and deprived of strength<br>fell down on the ground in intense anguish, like the peak of mountain<br>riven by thunder. And that best of elephants falling down on the earth,<br>Vikarna suddenly alighting in great terror, ran back full eight hundred<br>paces and ascended on the car of Vivingsati. And having slain with that<br>thunder-like arrow that elephant huge as a mighty hill and looking like a<br>mass of clouds, the son of Pritha smote Duryodhana in the breast with<br>another arrow of the same kind. And both the elephant and the king having<br>thus been wounded, and Vikarna having broken and fled along with the<br>supporters of the king's car, the other warriors, smitten with the arrows<br>shot from the Gandiva, fled from the field in panic. And beholding the<br>elephant slain by Partha, and all the other warriors running away,<br>Duryodhana, the foremost of the Kurus, turning away his car precipitately<br>fled in that direction where Partha was not. And when Duryodhana was fast<br>running away in alarm, pierced by that arrow and vomitting forth blood,<br>Kiritin, still eager for battle and capable of enduring every enemy, thus<br>censured him from wrath, 'Sacrificing thy great fame and glory, why dost<br>thou fly away, turning the back? Why are not those trumpet? sounded now,<br>as they were when thou hadst set out from thy kingdom? Lo, I am an<br>obedient servant of Yudhishthira, myself being the third son of Pritha,<br>standing here for battle. Turn back, show me thy face, O son of<br>Dhritarashtra, and bear in thy mind the behaviour of kings. The name<br>Duryodhana bestowed on thee before is hereby rendered meaningless. When<br>thou runnest away, leaving the battle, where is thy persistence in<br>battle? Neither do I behold thy body-guards. O Duryodhana, before nor<br>behind. O foremost of men, fly thou away and save thy life which is dear<br>from the hands of Pandu's son.'"
