                            "Vaisampayana said, 'O mighty king, entering into king Virata's service,<br>and dwelling in disguise in his excellent city, the high-souled Pandavas<br>of immeasurable prowess, completed the promised period of non-discovery.<br>And after Kichaka had been slain, that slayer of hostile heroes, the<br>mighty king Virata began to rest his hopes on the sons of Kunti. And it<br>was on the expiry of the thirteenth year of their exile, O Bharata, that<br>Susarman seized Virata's cattle by thousands. And when the cattle had<br>been seized, the herdsman of Virata came with great speed to the city,<br>and saw his sovereign, the king of Matsyas, seated on the throne in the<br>midst of wise councillors, and those bulls among men, the sons of Pandu,<br>and surrounded by brave warriors decked with ear-rings and bracelets. And<br>appearing before that enhancer of his dominion&#8212;King Virata seated in<br>court&#8212;the herdsman bowed down unto him, and addressed him, saying, 'O<br>foremost of kings, defeating and humiliating us in battle along with our<br>friends the Trigartas are seizing thy cattle by hundreds and by<br>thousands. Do thou, therefore, speedily rescue them. Oh, see that they<br>are not lost to thee.' Hearing these words, the king arrayed for battle<br>the Matsya force abounding in cars and elephants and horses and infantry<br>and standards. And kings and princes speedily put on, each in its proper<br>place,[26] their shining and beautiful armour worthy of being worn by<br>heroes. And Virata's beloved brother, Satanika, put on a coat of mail<br>made of adamantine steel, adorned with burnished gold. And Madirakshya,<br>next in birth to Satanika, put on a strong coat of mail plated with<br>gold[27] and capable of resisting every weapon. And the coat of mail that<br>the king himself of the Matsyas put on was invulnerable and decked with a<br>hundred suns, a hundred circles, a hundred spots, and a hundred eyes. And<br>the coat of mail that Suryadatta[28] put on was bright as the sun, plated<br>with gold, and broad as a hundred lotuses of the fragrant (Kahlara)<br>species. And the coat of mail that Virata's eldest son, the heroic<br>Sanksha, put on was impenetrable and made of burnished steel, and decked<br>with a hundred eyes of gold. And it was thus that those god-like and<br>mighty warriors by hundreds, furnished with weapons, and eager for<br>battle, each donned his corselet. And then they yoked unto their<br>excellent cars of white-hue steeds equipped in mail. And then was<br>hoisted&#8212;Matsya's glorious standard on his excellent car decked with gold<br>and resembling the sun or the moon in its effulgence. And other Kshatriya<br>warriors also raised on their respective cars gold-decked standards of<br>various shapes and devices. And king Matsya then addressed his brother<br>Satanika born immediately after him, saying, 'Kanka and Vallava and<br>Tantripala and Damagranthi of great energy will, as it appears to me<br>fight, without doubt. Give thou unto them cars furnished with banners and<br>let them case their persons in beautiful coats of mail that should be<br>both invulnerable and easy to wear. And let them also have weapons.<br>Bearing such martial forms and possessed of arms resembling the trunk of<br>mighty elephants, I can never persuade myself that they cannot fight.'<br>Hearing these words of the king, Satanika, O monarch, immediately ordered<br>cars for those sons of Pritha, viz., the royal Yudhishthira, and Bhima,<br>and Nakula, and Sahadeva, and commanded by the king, the charioteers,<br>with cheerful hearts and keeping loyalty in view, very soon got cars<br>ready (for the Pandavas). And those repressers of foes then donned those<br>beautiful coats of mail, invulnerable and easy to wear, that Virata had<br>ordered for those heroes of spotless fame. And mounted on cars yoked with<br>good steeds, those smiters of hostile ranks, those foremost of men, the<br>sons of Pritha, set out with cheerful hearts. Indeed, those mighty<br>warriors skilled in fight, those bulls of the Kuru race and sons of<br>Pandu, those four heroic brothers possessed of prowess incapable of being<br>baffled, mounting on cars decked with gold, together set out, following<br>Virata's wake. And infuriate elephants of terrible mien, full sixty years<br>of age, with shapely tusks and rent temples and juice trickling down and<br>looking (on that account) like cloud pouring rain and mounted by trained<br>warriors skilled in fight, followed the king like unto moving hills. And<br>the principal warriors of Matsya who cheerfully followed the king had<br>eight thousand cars, a thousand elephants and sixty thousand horses. And,<br>O bull among the Bharatas, that force of Virata, O king, as it marched<br>forth marking the footprints of the cattle looked exceedingly beautiful.<br>And on its march that foremost of armies owned by Virata, crowded with<br>soldiers armed with strong weapons, and abounding in elephants, horses<br>and cars, looked really splendid.'"
