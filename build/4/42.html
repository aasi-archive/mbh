Whose<br>is this excellent bow of good sides and easy hold, on the staff of which<br>shine golden elephants of such brightness? Whose is this excellent bow,<br>adorned with three scores of Indragoapkas [43] of pure gold, placed on<br>the back of the staff at proper intervals? Whose is this excellent bow,<br>furnished with three golden suns of great effulgence, blazing forth with<br>such brilliancy? Whose is this beautiful bow which is variegated with<br>gold and gems, and on which are golden insects set with beautiful stones?<br>Whose are these arrows furnished with wing around, numbering a thousand,<br>having golden heads, and cased in golden quivers? Who owneth these large<br>shafts, so thick, furnished with vulturine wings whetted on stone,<br>yellowish in hue, sharp-pointed, well-tempered, and entirely made of<br>iron? Whose is this sable quiver, [44] bearing five images of tigers,<br>which holdeth shafts intermixed with boar-eared arrows altogether<br>numbering ten? Whose are these seven hundred arrows, long and thick,<br>capable of drinking (the enemy's) blood, and looking like the<br>crescent-shaped moon? [45] Whose are these gold-crested arrows whetted on<br>stones, the lower halves of which are well-furnished with wings of the<br>hue of parrots' feather and the upper halves, of well-tempered steels?<br>[46] Whose is this excellent sword irresistible, and terrible to<br>adversaries, with the mark of a toad on it, and pointed like a toad's<br>head? [47] Cased in variegated sheath of tiger-skin, whose is this large<br>sword of excellent blade and variegated with gold and furnished with<br>tinkling bells? Whose is this handsome scimitar of polished blade and<br>golden hilt? Manufactured in the country of the Nishadas, irresistible,<br>incapable of being broken, whose is this sword of polished blade in a<br>scabbard of cow-skin? Whose is this beautiful and long sword, sable in<br>hue as the sky, mounted with gold, well-tempered, and cased in a sheath<br>of goat-skin? Who owneth this heavy, well-tempered, and broad sword, just<br>longer than the breadth of thirty fingers, polished by constant clash<br>with other's weapons and kept in a case of gold, bright as fire? Whose is<br>this beautiful scimitar of sable blade covered with golden bosses,<br>capable of cutting through the bodies of adversaries, whose touch is as<br>fatal as that of a venomous snake which is irresistible and exciteth the<br>terror of foes? Asked by me, O Vrihannala, do thou answer me truly. Great<br>is my wonder at the sight of all these excellent objects.'"
