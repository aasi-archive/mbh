                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Then while a great havoc was being made among the<br>Kurus, Santanu's son, Bhishma, and grandsire of the Bharatas rushed at<br>Arjuna, taking up an excellent bow adorned with gold, and many arrows<br>also of keen points and capable of piercing into the very vitals of the<br>foe and afflicting him sorely. And in consequence of a white umbrella<br>being held over his head, that tiger among men looked beautiful like unto<br>a hill at sunrise. And the son of Ganga, blowing his conch cheered the<br>sons of Dhritarashtra, and wheeling along his right came upon Vibhatsu<br>and impeded his course. And that slayer of hostile heroes, the son of<br>Kunti, beholding him approach, received him with a glad heart, like a<br>hill receiving a rain-charged cloud. And Bhishma, endued with great<br>energy, pierced Partha's flag-staff with eight arrows. The arrows<br>reaching the flag-staff of Pandu's son, struck the blazing ape and those<br>creatures also stationed in the banner-top. And then the son of Pandu,<br>with a mighty javelin of sharp-edge cut of Bhishma's umbrella which<br>instantly fell on the ground. And then the light-handed son of Kunti<br>struck his adversary's flag-staff also with many shafts, and then his<br>steeds and then the couple of drivers that protected Bhishma's flanks.<br>And unable to bear this, Bhishma though cognisant of the Pandava's might,<br>covered Dhananjaya with a powerful celestial weapon. And the son of<br>Pandu, of immeasurable soul, hurling in return a celestial weapon at<br>Bhishma, received that from Bhishma like a hill receiving a deep mass of<br>clouds. And the encounter that took place between Partha and Bhishma, was<br>fierce and the Kaurava warriors with their troops stood as lookers on.<br>And in the conflict between Bhishma and the son of Pandu, shafts striking<br>against shafts shone in the air like fireflies in the season of rains.<br>And, O king, in consequence of Partha's shooting arrows with both his<br>right and left hands, the bent Gandiva seemed like a continuous circle of<br>fire. And the son of Kunti then covered Bhishma with hundreds of sharp<br>and keen-edged arrows, like a cloud covering the mountain-breast with its<br>heavy downpour. And Bhishma baffled with the own arrows that arrowy<br>shower, like the bank resisting the swelling sea, and covered the son of<br>Pandu in return. And those warriors, cut into a thousand pieces in<br>battle, fell fast in the vicinity of Falguna's car. And then there was a<br>downpour, from the car of Pandu's son, of arrows furnished with golden<br>wing, and raining through the sky like a flight of locusts. And Bhishma<br>again repelled that arrowy shower with hundreds of whetted shafts shot by<br>him. And then the Kauravas exclaimed.&#8212;Excellent! Excellent!&#8212;Indeed,<br>Bhishma hath performed an exceedingly difficult feat inasmuch as he hath<br>fought with Arjuna. Dhananjaya is mighty and youthful, and dexterous and<br>swift of hand. Who else, save Bhishma, the son of Santanu, or Krishna,<br>the son of Devaki, or the mighty son of Bharadwaja, the foremost of<br>preceptors, is able to bear the impetus of Partha in battle? And<br>repelling weapons with weapons, those two bulls of the Bharata race, both<br>endued with great might, fought on playfully and infatuated the eyes of<br>all created beings. And those illustrious warriors ranged on the field of<br>battle, using the celestials weapons obtained from Prajapati and Indra,<br>and Agni and the fierce Rudra, and Kuvera, and Varuna, and Yama, and<br>Vayu. And all beings were greatly surprised, upon beholding those<br>warriors engaged in combat. And they all exclaimed,&#8212;Bravo Partha of long<br>arms? Bravo Bhishma! Indeed, this application of celestial weapons that<br>is being witnessed in the combat between Bhishma and Partha is rare among<br>human beings."<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus raged that conflict with weapons between<br>those warriors conversant with all weapons. And when that conflict of<br>celestial weapons ceased, then commenced a conflict with arrows. And<br>Jishnu approaching his opponent, cut of with an arrow sharp like a razor<br>the gold-decked bow of Bhishma. Within the twinkling of the eye, however,<br>Bhishma, that mighty-armed and great car-warrior, took up another bow and<br>stringed it. And inflamed with wrath, he showered upon Dhananjaya a cloud<br>of arrows. And Arjuna, too, endued with great energy, rained upon Bhishma<br>innumerable sharp-pointed and keen-edged arrows. And Bhishma also shot<br>clouds of arrows upon Pandu's son. And conversant with celestial weapons<br>and engaged in shooting and each other, arrows of keen points, no<br>distinction, O king, could then be perceived between those illustrious<br>warriors. And that mighty car-warrior, Kunti's son, covered with a<br>diadem, and the heroic son of Santanu, obscured the ten directions with<br>their arrows. And the Pandava covered Bhishma, and Bhishma also covered<br>the Pandava, with clouds of shafts. And, O king, wonderful was this<br>combat that took place in this world of men. And the heroic warriors that<br>protected Bhishma's car, slain by the son of Pandu, fell prostrate, O<br>monarch, beside the car of Kunti's son. And the feathery arrows of<br>Svetavahana, shot from the Gandiva, fell in all directions as if with the<br>object of making a wholesale slaughter of the foe. And issuing forth from<br>his car those blazing arrows furnished with golden wings looked like rows<br>of swans in the sky. And all the celestials with Indra, stationed in the<br>firmament, gazed with wonder upon another celestial weapon hurled with<br>great force by that wonderful archer Arjuna. And beholding that wonderful<br>weapon of great beauty, the mighty Gandiva, Chitrasena, highly pleased,<br>addressed the lord of celestials, saying, 'Behold these arrows shot by<br>Partha coursing through the sky in one continuous line. Wonderful is the<br>dexterity of Jishnu in evolving this celestial weapon! Human beings are<br>incapable of shooting such a weapon, for it does not exist among men. How<br>wonderful again is this concourse of mighty weapons existing from days of<br>old! No interval can be perceived between his taking up the arrows,<br>fixing them on the bow-string, and letting them off by stretching the<br>Gandiva. The soldiers are incapable of even looking at the son of Pandu,<br>who is like unto the midday sun blazing in the sky. So also none ventures<br>to look at Bhishma, the son of Ganga. Both are famous for their<br>achievements, and both are of fierce prowess. Both are equal in feats of<br>heroism, and both are difficult of being vanquished in battle.'<br><br>'Thus addressed by the Gandharva about that combat between Partha and<br>Bhishma, the lord of the celestials, O Bharata, paid proper respect unto<br>both by a shower of celestial flowers. Meanwhile, Bhishma, the son of<br>Santanu, assailed Arjuna on the left side, while that drawer of the bow<br>with either hands was on the point of piercing him. And at this,<br>Vibhatsu, laughing aloud, cut off with an arrow of keen edge and<br>furnished with vulturine wings, the bow of Bhishma, that hero of solar<br>effulgence. And then Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, pierced Bhishma in the<br>breast with ten shafts although the latter was contending with all his<br>prowess. And sorely afflicted with pain Ganga's son of mighty arms and<br>irresistible in battle, stood for a long time leaning on the pole of his<br>car. And beholding him deprived of consciousness the driver of his<br>car-steeds, calling to mind the instructions about protecting the<br>warriors when in a swoon, led him away for safety.'"
