                            Yudhishthira said, "Ye have already said what offices ye will<br>respectively perform. I also, according to the measure of my sense, have<br>said what office I will perform. Let our priest, accompanied by<br>charioteers and cooks, repair to the abode of Drupada, and there maintain<br>our Agnihotra fires. And let Indrasena and the others, taking with then<br>the empty cars, speedily proceeded to Dwaravati. Even this is my wish.<br>And let all these maid-servants of Draupadi go to the Panchalas, with our<br>charioteers and cooks. And let all of them say,&#8212;We do not know where the<br>Pandavas have gone leaving us at the lake of Dwaitavana."<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Having thus taken counsel of one another and told one<br>another the offices they would discharge, the Pandavas sought Dhaumya's<br>advice. And Dhaumya also gave them advice in the following words, saying,<br>Ye sons of Pandu, the arrangements ye have made regarding the Brahmanas,<br>yours friends, cars, weapons, and the (sacred) fires, are excellent. But<br>it behoveth thee, O Yudhishthira, and Arjuna specially, to make provision<br>for the protection of Draupadi. Ye king, ye are well-acquainted with the<br>characters of men. Yet whatever may be your knowledge, friends may from<br>affection be permitted to repeat what is already known. Even this is<br>subservient to the eternal interests of virtue, pleasure, and profit. I<br>shall, therefore speak to you something. Mark ye. To dwell with a king<br>is, alas, difficult. I shall tell you, ye princes, how ye may reside in<br>the royal household, avoiding every fault. Ye Kauravas, honourably or<br>otherwise, ye will have to pass this year in the king's palace,<br>undiscovered by those that know you. Then in the fourteenth year, ye will<br>live happy. O son of Pandu, in this world, that cherisher and protector<br>of all beings, the king, who is a deity in an embodied form, is as a<br>great fire sanctified with all the mantras. [6] One should present<br>himself before the king, after having obtained his permission at the<br>gate. No one should keep contact with royal secrets. Nor should one<br>desire a seat which another may covet. He who doth not, regarding himself<br>to be a favourite, occupy (the king's) car, or coach, or seat, or<br>vehicle, or elephant, is alone worthy of dwelling in a royal household.<br>He that sits not upon a seat the occupation of which is calculated raise<br>alarm in the minds of malicious people, is alone worthy of dwelling in a<br>royal household. No one should, unasked offer counsel (to a king). Paying<br>homage in season unto the king, one should silently and respectfully sit<br>beside the king, for kings take umbrage at babblers, and disgrace laying<br>counsellors. A wise person should not contact friendship with the king's<br>wife, nor with the inmates of the inner apartments, nor with those that<br>are objects of royal displeasure. One about the king should do even the<br>most unimportant acts and with the king's knowledge. Behaving thus with a<br>sovereign, one doth not come by harm. Even if an individual attain the<br>highest office, he should, as long as he is not asked or commanded,<br>consider himself as born-blind, having regard to the king's dignity, for<br>O repressers of foes, the rulers of men do not forgive even their sons<br>and grandsons and brothers when they happen to tamper with their dignity.<br>Kings should be served with regardful care, even as Agni and other god;<br>and he that is disloyal to his sovereign, is certainly destroyed by him.<br>Renouncing anger, and pride, and negligence, it behoveth a man to follow<br>the course directed by the monarch. After carefully deliberating on all<br>things, a person should set forth before the king those topics that are<br>both profitable and pleasant; but should a subject be profitable without<br>being pleasant, he should still communicate it, despite its<br>disagreeableness. It behoveth a man to be well-disposed towards the king<br>in all his interests, and not to indulge in speech that is alike<br>unpleasant and profitless. Always thinking&#8212;I am not liked by the<br>king&#8212;one should banish negligence, and be intent on bringing about what<br>is agreeable and advantageous to him. He that swerveth not from his<br>place, he that is not friendly to those that are hostile to the king, he<br>that striveth not to do wrong to the king, is alone worthy to dwell in a<br>royal household. A learned man should sit either on the king's right or<br>the left; he should not sit behind him for that is the place appointed<br>for armed guards, and to sit before him is always interdicted. Let none,<br>when the king is engaged in doing anything (in respect of his servants)<br>come forward pressing himself zealously before others, for even if the<br>aggrieved be very poor, such conduct would still be inexcusable.[7] It<br>behoveth no man to reveal to others any lie the king may have told<br>inasmuch as the king bears ill will to those that report his falsehoods.<br>Kings also always disregard persons that regard themselves as learned. No<br>man should be proud thinking&#8212;I am brave, or, I am intelligent, but a<br>person obtains the good graces of a king and enjoys the good things of<br>life, by behaving agreeably to the wishes of the king. And, O Bharata,<br>obtaining things agreeable, and wealth also which is so hard to acquire,<br>a person should always do what is profitable as well as pleasant to the<br>king. What man that is respected by the wise can even think of doing<br>mischief to one whose ire is great impediment and whose favour is<br>productive of mighty fruits? No one should move his lips, arms and<br>thighs, before the king. A person should speak and spit before the king<br>only mildly. In the presence of even laughable objects, a man should not<br>break out into loud laughter, like a maniac; nor should one show<br>(unreasonable) gravity by containing himself, to the utmost. One should<br>smile modestly, to show his interest (in what is before him). He that is<br>ever mindful of the king's welfare, and is neither exhilarated by reward<br>nor depressed by disgrace, is alone worthy of dwelling in a royal<br>household. That learned courtier who always pleaseth the king and his son<br>with agreeable speeches, succeedeth in dwelling in a royal household as a<br>favourite. The favourite courtier who, having lost the royal favour for<br>just reason, does not speak evil of the king, regains prosperity. The man<br>who serveth the king or liveth in his domains, if sagacious, should speak<br>in praise of the king, both in his presence and absence. The courtier who<br>attempts to obtain his end by employing force on the king, cannot keep<br>his place long and incurs also the risk of death. None should, for the<br>purpose of self-interest, open communications with the king's enemies.[8]<br>Nor should one distinguish himself above the king in matters requiring<br>ability and talents. He that is always cheerful and strong, brave and<br>truthful, and mild, and of subdued senses, and who followeth his master<br>like his shadow, is alone worthy to dwell in a royal household. He that<br>on being entrusted with a work, cometh forward, saying,&#8212;I will do<br>this&#8212;is alone worthy of living in a royal household. He that on being<br>entrusted with a task, either within the king's dominion or out of it,<br>never feareth to undertake it, is alone fit to reside in a royal<br>household. He that living away from his home, doth no remember his dear<br>ones, and who undergoeth (present) misery in expectation of (future)<br>happiness, is alone worthy of dwelling in a royal household. One should<br>not dress like the king, nor should one indulge, in laughter in the<br>king's presence nor should one disclose royal secrets. By acting thus one<br>may win royal favour. Commissioned to a task, one should not touch bribes<br>for by such appropriation one becometh liable to fetters or death. The<br>robes, ornaments, cars, and other things which the king may be pleased to<br>bestow should always be used, for by this, one winneth the royal favour.<br>Ye children, controlling your minds, do ye spend this year, ye sons of<br>Pandu, behaving in this way. Regaining your own kingdom, ye may live as<br>ye please."<br><br>Yudhishthira said, "We have been well taught by thee. Blessed be thou.<br>There is none that could say so to us, save our mother Kunti and Vidura<br>of great wisdom. It behoveth thee to do all that is necessary now for our<br>departure, and for enabling us to come safely through this woe, as well<br>as for our victory over the foe."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus addressed by Yudhishthira, Dhaumya, that<br>best of Brahmanas, performed according to the ordinance the rites<br>ordained in respect of departure. And lighting up their fires, he<br>offered, with mantras, oblations on them for the prosperity and success<br>of the Pandavas, as for their reconquest of the whole world. And walking<br>round those fires and round the Brahmanas of ascetic wealth, the six set<br>out, placing Yajnaseni in their front. And when those heroes had<br>departed, Dhaumya, that best of ascetics, taking their sacred fires, set<br>out for the Panchalas. And Indrasena, and others already mentioned, went<br>to the Yadavas, and looking after the horses and the cars of the Pandavas<br>passed their time happily and in privacy."
