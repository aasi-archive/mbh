                            "Aswatthaman said, 'The kine, O Karna, have not yet been won, nor have<br>they yet crossed the boundary (of their owner's dominions), nor have they<br>yet reached Hastinapura. Why dost thou, therefore, boast of thyself?<br>Having won numerous battles, and acquired enormous wealth, and vanquished<br>hostile hosts, men of true heroism speak not a word of their prowess.<br>Fire burneth mutely and mutely doth the sun shine. Mutely also doth the<br>Earth bear creatures, both mobile and immobile. The Self-existent hath<br>sanctioned such offices for the four orders that having recourse to them<br>each may acquire wealth without being censurable. A Brahmana, having<br>studied the Vedas, should perform sacrifices himself, and officiate at<br>the sacrifices of others. And a Kshatriya, depending upon the bow, should<br>perform sacrifices himself but should never officiate at the sacrifices<br>of others. And of Vaisya, having earned wealth, should cause the rites<br>enjoined in the Vedas to be performed for himself. A Sudra should always<br>wait upon and serve the other three orders. As regards those that live by<br>practising the profession of flowers and vendors of meat, they may earn<br>wealth by expedients fraught with deceit and fraud. Always acting<br>according to the dictates of the scriptures, the exalted sons of Pandu<br>acquired the sovereignty of the whole earth, and they always act<br>respectfully towards their superiors, even if the latter prove hostile to<br>them. What Kshatriya is there that expressed delight at having obtained a<br>kingdom by means of dice, like this wicked and shameless son of<br>Dhritarashtra? Having acquired wealth in this way by deceit and fraud<br>like a vendor of meat, who that is wise boast of it? In what single<br>combat didst thou vanquish Dhananjaya, or Nakula, or Sahadeva, although<br>thou hast robbed them of their wealth? In what battle didst thou defeat<br>Yudhishthira, or Bhima that foremost of strong men? In what battle was<br>Indraprastha conquered by thee? What thou hast done, however, O thou of<br>wicked deeds, is to drag that princess to court while she was ill and had<br>but one raiment on? Thou hast cut the mighty root, delicate as the<br>sandal, of the Pandava tree. Actuated by desire of wealth, when thou<br>madest the Pandavas act as slaves, rememberest thou what Vidura said! We<br>see that men and others, even insects and ants, show forgiveness<br>according to their power of endurance. The son of Pandu, however, is<br>incapable of forgiving the sufferings of Draupadi. Surely, Dhananjaya<br>cometh here for the destruction of the sons of Dhritarashtra. It is true,<br>affecting great wisdom, thou art for making speeches but will not<br>Vibhatsu, that slayer of foes, exterminate us all! If it be gods, or<br>Gandharvas or Asuras, or Rakshasas, will Dhananjaya the son of Kunti,<br>desist to fight from panic? Inflamed with wrath upon whomsoever he will<br>fall, even him he will overthrow like a tree under the weight of Garuda!<br>Superior to thee in prowess, in bowmanship equal unto the lord himself of<br>the celestials, and in battle equal unto Vasudeva himself, who is there<br>that would not praise Partha? Counteracting celestial weapons with<br>celestial, and human weapons with human, what man is a match for Arjuna?<br>Those acquainted with the scriptures declare that a disciple is no way<br>inferior to a son, and it is for this that the son of Pandu is a<br>favourite of Drona. Employ thou the means now which thou hadst adopted in<br>the match at dice,&#8212;the same means, viz., by which thou hadst subjugated<br>Indraprastha, and the same means by which thou hadst dragged Krishna to<br>the assembly! This thy wise uncle, fully conversant with the duties of<br>the Kshatriya order&#8212;this deceitful gambler Sakuni, the prince of<br>Gandhara, let him fight now! The Gandiva, however, doth not cast dice<br>such as the Krita or the Dwapara, but it shooteth upon foes blazing and<br>keen-edged shafts by myriads. The fierce arrows shot from the Gandiva,<br>endued with great energy and furnished with vulturine wings, car, pierce<br>even mountains. The destroyer of all, named Yama, and Vayu, and the<br>horse-faced Agni, leave some remnant behind, but Dhananjaya inflamed with<br>wrath never doth so. As thou hadst, aided by thy uncle, played a dice in<br>the assembly so do fight in this battle protected by Suvala's son. Let<br>the preceptor, if he chooses fight; I shall not, however, fight with<br>Dhananjaya. We are to fight with the king of the Matsyas, if indeed, he<br>cometh in the track of the kine.'"
