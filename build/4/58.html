                            "Vaisampayana said, 'After Kripa had thus been taken away, the invincible<br>Drona of red steeds, taking up his bow to which he had already stringed<br>an arrow, rushed towards Arjuna of white steeds. And beholding at no<br>great distance from him the preceptor advancing on his golden car, Arjuna<br>that foremost of victorious warriors, addressing Uttara, said, 'Blessed<br>be thou, O friend, carry me before that warrior on whose high banner-top<br>is seen a golden altar resembling a long flame of fire and decked with<br>numerous flags placed around, and whose car is drawn by steeds that are<br>red and large, exceedingly handsome and highly-trained, of face pleasant<br>and of quiet mien, and like unto corals in colour and with faces of<br>coppery hue, for that warrior is Drona with whom I desire to fight. Of<br>long arms and endued with mighty energy possessed of strength and beauty<br>of person, celebrated over all the worlds for his prowess, resembling<br>Usanas himself in intelligence and Vrihaspati in knowledge of morality,<br>he is conversant with the four Vedas and devoted to the practice of<br>Brahmacharya virtues. O friend, the use of the celestial weapons together<br>with the mysteries of their withdrawal and the entire-science of weapons,<br>always reside in him. Forgiveness, self-control, truth, abstention from<br>injury, rectitude of conduct,&#8212;these and countless other virtues always<br>dwell in that regenerate one. I desire to fight with that highly-blessed<br>one on the field. Therefore, take me before the preceptor and carry me<br>thither, O Uttara.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by Arjuna, Virata's son urged<br>his steeds decked with gold towards the car of Bharadwaja's son. And<br>Drona also rushed towards the impetuously advancing Partha, the son of<br>Pandu,&#8212;that foremost of car-warriors,&#8212;like an infuriate elephant<br>rushing towards an infuriate compeer. And the son of Bharadwaja then blew<br>his conch whose blare resembled that of a hundred trumpets. And at that<br>sound the whole army become agitated like the sea in a tempest. And<br>beholding those excellent steeds red in hue mingling in battle with<br>Arjuna's steeds of swan-like whiteness endued with the speed of the mind,<br>all the spectators were filled with wonder. And seeing on the field of<br>battle those car-warriors&#8212;the preceptor Drona and his disciple<br>Partha&#8212;both endued with prowess, both invincible, both well-trained,<br>both possessed of great energy and great strength, engaged with each<br>other, that mighty host of the Bharatas began to tremble frequently. And<br>that mighty car-warrior Partha, possessed of great prowess and filled<br>with joy upon reaching Drona's car on his own, saluted the preceptor. And<br>that slayer of hostile heroes, the mighty armed son of Kunti, then<br>addressed Drona in an humble and sweet tone, saying, 'Having completed<br>our exile in the woods, we are now desirous of avenging our wrongs. Even<br>invincible in battle, it doth not behove thee to be angry with us. O<br>sinless one, I will not strike thee unless thou strikest me first. Even<br>this is my intention. It behoveth thee to act as thou choosest.' Thus<br>addressed Drona discharged at him more than twenty arrows. But the<br>light-handed Partha cut them off before they could reach him. And at<br>this, the mighty Drona, displaying his lightness of hand in the use of<br>weapons, covered Partha's car with a thousand arrows. And desirous of<br>angering, Partha, that hero of immeasurable soul, then covered his steeds<br>of silvery whiteness with arrows whetted on stone and winged with the<br>feathers of the Kanka bird. And when the battle between Drona and Kiritin<br>thus commenced, both of them discharging in the encounter arrows of<br>blazing splendour, both well-known for their achievements, both equal to<br>the wind itself in speed, both conversant with celestial weapons, and<br>both endued with mighty energy, began shooting clouds of arrows to<br>bewilder the royal Kshatriyas. And all the warriors that were assembled<br>there were filled with wonder at sight of all this. And they all admired<br>Drona who quickly shot clouds of arrows exclaiming,&#8212;Well done! Well<br>done! Indeed, who else save Falguna, is worthy of fighting with Drona in<br>battle? Surely the duties of a Kshatriya are stern, for Arjuna fighteth<br>with even his own preceptor!&#8212;And it was thus that they who stood on the<br>field of battle said unto one another. And inflamed with fire, those<br>mighty-armed heroes standing before other, and each incapable of<br>overcoming the other, covered each other with arrowy showers. And<br>Bharadwaja's son, waxing worth, drew his large and unconquerable bow<br>plated on the back with gold, and pierced Falguna with his arrows. And<br>discharging at Arjuna's car innumerable whetted arrows possessed of solar<br>effulgence, he entirely shrouded the light of the sun. And that great<br>car-warrior of mighty arms, violently pierced Pritha's son with<br>keen-edged shafts even as the clouds shower upon a mountain. Then taking<br>up that foremost of bows, the Gandiva, destructive of foes and capable of<br>withstanding the greatest strain, the impetuous son of Pandu cheerfully<br>discharged countless shafts of various kinds adorned with gold, and that<br>powerful warrior also baffled in a moment Drona's arrowy shower by means<br>of those shafts shot from his own bow. And at this the spectators<br>wondered greatly. And the handsome Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, ranging<br>on his car, displayed his weapons on all sides at the same time. And the<br>entire welkin covered with his arrows, became one wide expanse of shade.<br>And at this Drona become invisible like the sun enveloped in mist. And<br>shrouded by those excellent arrows on all sides, Drona looked like a<br>mountain on fire. And beholding his own car completely enveloped by the<br>arrows of Pritha's son, Drona that ornament of battle, bent his terrible<br>and foremost of bows whose noise was as loud as that of the clouds. And<br>drawing that first of weapons, which was like unto a circle of fire, he<br>discharged a cloud of keen-edged shafts. And then there were heard on the<br>field loud sounds like the splitting of bamboos set on fire. And that<br>warrior of immeasurable soul, shooting from his bow arrows furnished with<br>golden wings, covered all sides, shrouding the very light of the sun. And<br>those arrows with knots well-peeled off, and furnished with golden wings,<br>looked like flocks of birds in the sky. And the arrows discharged by<br>Drona from his bow, touching one another at the wings, appeared like one<br>endless line in the sky. And those heroes, thus discharging their arrows<br>decked with gold, seemed to cover the sky with showers of meteors. And<br>furnished with feathers of the Kanka bird, those arrows looked like rows<br>of cranes ranging in the autumnal sky. And the fierce and terrible<br>encounter that took place between the illustrious Drona and Arjuna<br>resembled that between Virata and Vasava of old. And discharging arrows<br>at each other from bows drawn at their fullest stretch, they resembled<br>two elephants assailing each other with their tusks. And those wrathful<br>warriors&#8212;those ornaments of battle&#8212;fighting strictly according to<br>established usage, displayed in that conflict various celestial weapons<br>in due order. Then that foremost of victorious men, Arjuna, by means of<br>his keen shafts resisted the whetted arrows shot by that best of<br>preceptors. And displaying before the spectators various weapons, that<br>hero of terrible prowess covered the sky with various kinds of arrows.<br>And beholding that tiger among men, Arjuna, endued with fierce energy and<br>intent upon striking him, that foremost of warriors and best of<br>preceptors (from affection) began to fight with him playfully by means of<br>smooth and straight arrows. And Bharadwaja's son fought on with Falguna,<br>resisting with his own the celestial weapons shot by the former. And the<br>fight that took place between those enraged lions among men, incapable of<br>bearing each other, was like unto encounter between the gods and the<br>Danavas. And the son of Pandu repeatedly baffled with his own, the<br>Aindra, the Vayavya, and the Agneya weapons that were shot by Drona. And<br>discharging keen shafts, those mighty bowmen, by their arrowy showers<br>completely covered the sky and made a wide expanse of shade. And then the<br>arrows shot by Arjuna, falling on the bodies of hostile warriors,<br>produced the crash of thunderbolt. O king, elephants, cars, and horses,<br>bathed in blood, looked like Kinsuka trees crowned with flowers. And in<br>that encounter between Drona and Arjuna, beholding the field covered with<br>arms decked with bangles, and gorgeously-attired car-warriors, and coats<br>of mail variegated with gold, and with banners lying scattered all about,<br>and with warriors slain by means of Partha's arrows, the Kuru host became<br>panic-stricken. And shaking their bows capable of bearing much strain,<br>those combatants began to shroud and weaken each other with their shafts.<br>And, O bull of the Bharata race, the encounter that took place between<br>Drona and Kunti's son was dreadful in the extreme and resembled that<br>between Vali and Vasava. And staking their very lives, they began to<br>pierce each other straight arrows shot from their fully-stretched<br>bow-strings. And a voice was heard in the sky applauding Drona, and<br>saying, 'Difficult is the feat performed by Drona, inasmuch as he<br>fighteth with Arjuna,&#8212;that grinder of foes, that warrior endued with<br>mighty energy, of firm grasp, and invincible in battle,&#8212;that conqueror<br>of both celestials and Daityas, that foremost of all car-warriors.' And<br>beholding Partha's infallibility, training, fleetness of hand, and the<br>range also of Arjuna's, arrows, Drona became amazed. And, O bull of the<br>Bharata race, lifting up his excellent bow, the Gandiva the unforbearing<br>Partha drew it now with one hand and now with another shot an arrowy<br>shower. And beholding that shower resembling a flight of locusts, the<br>spectators wondering applauded him exclaiming, 'Excellent'! 'Excellent'!<br>And so ceaselessly did he shoot his arrows that the very air was unable<br>to penetrate the thick array. And the spectators could not perceive any<br>interval between the taking up of the arrows and letting them off. And in<br>that fierce encounter characterised by lightness of hand in the discharge<br>of weapons, Partha began to shoot his arrows more quickly than before.<br>And then all at once hundreds and thousands of straight arrows fell upon<br>Drona's car. And, O bull of the Bharata race, beholding Drona completely<br>covered by the wielder of the Gandiva with his arrows, the Kuru army set<br>up exclamation of 'Oh'! and 'Alas'! And Maghavat, together with those<br>Gandharvas and Apsaras that have come there, applauded the fleetness of<br>Partha's hand. And that mighty car-warrior, the preceptor's son, then<br>resisted the Pandva with a mighty array of cars. And although enraged<br>with Arjuna, yet Aswatthaman mentally admired that feat of the<br>high-souled son of Pritha. And waxing wroth, he rushed towards Partha,<br>and discharged at him an arrowy shower like a heavy down-pour by the<br>cloud. And turning his steeds towards Drona's son, Partha gave Drona an<br>opportunity to leave the field. And thereupon the latter, wounded in that<br>terrible encounter, and his mail and banner gone sped away by the aid of<br>swift horses.'"
