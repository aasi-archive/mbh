                            (Kichaka-badha Parva)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Living in such disguise, those mighty warriors, the<br>sons of Pritha, passed ten months in Matsya's city. And, O monarch,<br>although herself deserving to be waited upon by others, the daughter of<br>Yajnasena, O Janamejaya, passed her days in extreme misery, waiting upon<br>Sudeshna. And residing thus in Sudeshna's apartments, the princess of<br>Panchala pleased that lady as also the other females of the inner<br>apartments. And it came to pass that as the year was about to expire, the<br>redoubtable Kichaka, the Commander of Virata's forces, chanced to behold<br>the daughter of Drupada. And beholding that lady endued with the<br>splendour of a daughter of the celestials, treading the earth like a<br>goddess, Kichaka, afflicted with the shafts of Kama, desired to possess<br>her. And burning with desire's flame, Virata's general came to Sudeshna<br>(his sister) and smilingly addressed her in these words, 'This beauteous<br>lady had never before been seen by me in king Virata's abode. This damsel<br>maddens me with her beauty, even as a new wine maddens one with its<br>fragrance. Tell me, who is this graceful and captivating lady possessed<br>of the beauty of a goddess, and whose she is, and whence she hath come.<br>Surely, grinding my heart she hath reduced me to subjection. It seems to<br>me that (save her) there is no other medicine for my illness. O, this<br>fair hand-maid of thine seemeth to me to be possessed of the beauty of a<br>goddess. Surely, one like her is ill suited to serve thee. Let her rule<br>over me and whatever is mine. O, let her grace my spacious and beautiful<br>palace, decked with various ornaments of gold, full of viands and drinks<br>in profusion, with excellent plates, and containing every kind of plenty,<br>besides elephants and horses and cars in myriads. And having consulted<br>with Sudeshna thus, Kichaka went to princess Draupadi, and like a jackal<br>in the forest accosting a lioness, spoke unto Krishna these words in a<br>winning voice, 'Who and whose art thou, O beautiful one? And O thou of<br>beautiful face, whence hast thou come to the city of Virata? Tell me all<br>this, O fair lady. Thy beauty and gracefulness are of the very first<br>order and the comeliness of thy features is unparalleled. With its<br>loveliness thy face shineth ever like the resplendent moon. O thou of<br>fair eye-brows, thy eyes are beautiful and large like lotus-petals. Thy<br>speech also, O thou of beautiful limbs, resembles the notes of the<br>cuckoo. O thou of fair hips, never before in this world have I beheld a<br>woman possessed of beauty like thine, O thou of faultless features. Art<br>thou Lakshmi herself having her abode in the midst of lotuses or, art<br>thou, O slender-waisted one, she who is called Bhuti[13]. Or, which<br>amongst these&#8212;Hri, Sri, Kirti and Kanti,&#8212;art thou, O thou of beautiful<br>face? Or possessed of beauty like Rati's, art thou, she who sporteth in<br>the embraces of the God of love? O thou that possessest the fairest of<br>eye-brows, thou shinest beautifully even like the lovely light of the<br>moon. Who is there in the whole world that will not succumb to the<br>influence of desire beholding thy face? Endued with unrivalled beauty and<br>celestial grace of the most attractive kind, that face of thine is even<br>like the full moon, its celestial effulgence resembling his radiant face,<br>its smile resembling his soft-light, and its eye-lashes looking like the<br>spokes on his disc? Both thy bosoms, so beautiful and well-developed and<br>endued with unrivalled gracefulness and deep and well-rounded and without<br>any space between them, are certainly worthy of being decked with<br>garlands of gold. Resembling in shape the beautiful buds of the lotus,<br>these thy breast, O thou of fair eye-brows, are even as the whips of Kama<br>that are urging me forward, O thou of sweet smiles, O damsel of slender<br>waist, beholding that waist of thine marked with four wrinkles and<br>measuring but a span, and slightly stooping forward because of the weight<br>of thy breasts, and also looking on those graceful hips of thine broad as<br>the banks of a river, the incurable fever of desire, O beauteous lady,<br>afflicteth me sore. The flaming fire of desire, fierce as a forest<br>conflagration, and fanned by the hope my heart cherisheth of a union with<br>thee is consuming me intensely. O thou of exceeding beauty quench thou<br>that flaming fire kindled by Manmatha. Union with thee is a rain-charged<br>cloud, and the surrender of thy person is the shower that the cloud may<br>drop. O thou of face resembling the moon, the fierce and maddening shafts<br>of Manmatha whetted and sharpened by the desire of a union with thee,<br>piercing this heart of mine in their impetuous course, have penetrated<br>into its core. O black-eyed lady, those impetuous and cruel shafts are<br>maddening me beyond endurance. It behoveth thee to relieve me from this<br>plight by surrendering thyself to me and favouring me with thy embraces.<br>Decked in beautiful garlands and robes and adorned with every ornament,<br>sport thou, O sweet damsel, with me to thy fill. O thou of the gait of an<br>elephant in rut, deserving as thou art of happiness though deprived of it<br>now, it behoveth thee not to dwell here in misery. Let unrivalled weal be<br>thine. Drinking various kinds of charming and delicious and ambrosial<br>wines, and sporting at thy pleasure in the enjoyment of diverse objects<br>of delight, do thou, O blessed lady, attain auspicious prosperity. This<br>beauty of thine and this prime of thy youth, O sweet lady, are now<br>without their use. For, O beauteous and chaste damsel, endued with such<br>loveliness, thou dost not shine, like a graceful garland lying unused and<br>unworn. I will forsake all my old wives. Let them, O thou of sweet<br>smiles, become thy slaves. And I also, O fair damsel, will stay by thee<br>as thy slave, ever obedient to thee, O thou of the most handsome face.'<br>Hearing these words of his, Draupadi replied, 'In desiring me, a female<br>servant of low extraction, employed in the despicable office of dressing<br>hair, O Suta's son, thou desirest one that deserves not that honour.<br>Then, again, I am the wife of others. Therefore, good betide thee, this<br>conduct of thine is not proper. Do thou remember the precept of morality,<br>viz., that persons should take delight only in their wedded wives. Thou<br>shouldst not, therefore, by any means bend thy heart to adultery. Surely<br>abstaining from improper acts is ever the study of those that are good.<br>Overcome by ignorance sinful men under the influence of desire come by<br>either extreme infamy or dreadful calamity.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by the Sairindhri, the wicked<br>Kichaka losing control over his senses and overcome by lust, although<br>aware of the numerous evils of fornication, evils condemned by everybody<br>and sometimes leading to the destruction of life itself,&#8212;then spoke unto<br>Draupadi, 'It behoveth thee not, O beauteous lady, O thou of graceful<br>features, thus to disregard me who am, O thou of sweet smiles, under the<br>power of Manmatha on thy account. If now, O timid one, thou disregardest<br>me who am under thy influence and who speak to thee so fair, thou wilt, O<br>black-eyed damsel, have to repent for it afterwards. O thou of graceful<br>eye-brows, the real lord of this entire kingdom, O slender-waisted lady,<br>is myself. It is me depending upon whom the people of this realm live. In<br>energy and prowess I am unrivalled on earth. There is no other man on<br>earth who rivals me in beauty of person, in youth, in prosperity, and in<br>the possession of excellent objects of enjoyment. Why it is, O auspicious<br>lady, that having it in thy power to enjoy here every object of desire<br>and every luxury and comfort without its equal, thou preferest servitude.<br>Becoming the mistress of this kingdom which I shall confer on thee, O<br>thou of fair face, accept me, and enjoy, O beauteous one, all excellent<br>objects of desire.' Addressed in these accursed words by Kichaka, that<br>chaste daughter of Drupada answered him thus reprovingly, 'Do not, O son<br>of a Suta, act so foolishly and do not throw away thy life. Know that I<br>am protected by my five husbands. Thou canst not have me. I have<br>Gandharvas for my husbands. Enraged they will slay thee. Therefore, do<br>thou not bring destruction on thyself. Thou intendest to tread along a<br>path that is incapable of being trod by men. Thou, O wicked one, art even<br>like a foolish child that standing on one shore of the ocean intends to<br>cross over to the other. Even if thou enterest into the interior of the<br>earth, or soarest into the sky, or rushest to the other shore of the<br>ocean, still thou wilt have no escape from the hands of those sky-ranging<br>offspring of gods, capable of grinding all foes. Why dost thou today, O<br>Kichaka, solicit me so persistently even as a sick person wisheth for the<br>night that will put a stop to his existence? Why dost thou desire me,<br>even like an infant lying on its mother's lap wishing to catch the moon?<br>For thee that thus solicitest their beloved wife, there is no refuge<br>either on earth or in sky. O Kichaka, hast thou no sense which leads thee<br>to seek thy good and by which thy life may be saved?'"
