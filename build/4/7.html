                            Vaisampayana said, "Then tying up in his cloth dice made of gold and set<br>with lapis lazuli, and holding them below his arm-pit, king<br>Yudhishthira,&#8212;that illustrious lord of men&#8212;that high-souled perpetuator<br>of the Kuru race, regarded by kings, irrepressible in might, and like<br>unto a snake of virulent poison,&#8212;that bull among men, endued with<br>strength and beauty and prowess, and possessed of greatness, and<br>resembling in form a celestial though now like unto the sun enveloped in<br>dense clouds, or fire covered with ashes, first made his appearance when<br>the famous king Virata was seated in his court. And beholding with his<br>followers that son of Pandu in his court, looking like the moon hid in<br>clouds and possessed of a face beautiful as the full moon, king Virata<br>addressed his counsellors and the twice-born ones and the charioteers and<br>the Vaisyas and others, saying, "Enquire ye who it is, so like a king<br>that looketh on my court for the first time. He cannot be a Brahmana.<br>Methinks he is a man of men, and a lord of earth. He hath neither slaves,<br>nor cars, nor elephants with him, yet he shineth like the very Indra. The<br>marks on his person indicate him to be one whose coronal locks have<br>undergone the sacred investiture. Even this is my belief. He approacheth<br>me without any hesitation, even as an elephant in rut approacheth an<br>assemblage of lotuses!'<br><br>"And as the king was indulging in these thoughts, that bull among men,<br>Yudhishthira, came before Virata and addressed him, saying, 'O great<br>king, know me for a Brahmana who, having lost his all hath come to thee<br>for the means of subsistence. I desire, O sinless one, to live here<br>beside thee acting under thy commands,[11] O lord. The king then,<br>well-pleased, replied unto him saying, 'Thou art welcome. Do thou then<br>accept the appointment thou seekest!' And having appointed the lion among<br>kings in the post he had prayed for, king Virata addressed him with a<br>glad heart, saying, 'O child, I ask thee from affection, from the<br>dominions of what king dost thou come hither? Tell me also truly what is<br>thy name and family, and what thou hast a knowledge of.'"<br><br>Yudhishthira said, "My name is Kanka, and I am a Brahmana belonging to<br>the family known by the name of Vaiyaghra. I am skilled in casting dice,<br>and formerly I was a friend of Yudhishthira."<br><br>Virata replied, "I will grant thee whatever boon thou mayst desire. Do<br>thou rule the Matsyas.&#8212;I shall remain in submission to thee. Even<br>cunning gamblers are liked by me. Thou, on the other hand, art like a<br>god, and deservest a kingdom."<br><br>Yudhishthira said, "My first prayer, O lord of earth, is that I may not<br>be involved in any dispute (on account of dice) with low people. Further,<br>a person defeated by me (at dice) shall not be permitted to retain the<br>wealth (won by me). Let this boon be granted to me through thy grace."<br><br>Virata replied, "I shall certainly slay him who may happen to displease<br>thee, and should be one of the twice-born ones, I shall banish him from<br>my dominions. Let the assembled subjects listen! Kanka is as much lord of<br>this realm as I myself, Thou (Kanka) shalt be my friend and shalt ride<br>the same vehicles as I. And there shall also be at thy disposal apparel<br>in plenty, and various kinds of viands and drinks. And thou shalt look<br>into my affairs, both internal and external. And for thee all my doors<br>shall be open. When men out of employ or of strained circumstances will<br>apply to thee, do thou at all hours bring their words unto me, and I will<br>surely give them whatever they desire. No fear shall be thine as long as<br>thou residest with me."<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Having thus obtained an interview with Virata's king,<br>and received from him boons, that heroic bull among men, began to live<br>happily, highly regarded by all. Nor could any one discover him as he<br>lived there."
