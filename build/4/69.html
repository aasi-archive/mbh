                            "Uttara said, 'The kine have not been recovered by me, nor have the foe<br>been vanquished by me. All that hath been accomplished by the son of a<br>deity. Capable of striking like a thunderbolt, that youth of celestial<br>origin, beholding me running away in fear, stopped me and himself mounted<br>on my car. It was by him that the kine have been recovered and the<br>Kauravas vanquished. The deed, O father, is that hero's and not mine. It<br>was he that repulsed with arrows Kripa and Drona and Drona's son of<br>powerful energy, and the Suta's son and Bhishma. That mighty hero then<br>spoke unto the affrighted prince Duryodhana who was running away like the<br>leader of a head of elephants, these words, 'O prince of the Kuru race, I<br>do not see that thou art safe by any means even at Hastinapura. Protect<br>thy life by putting forth thy might. Thou shalt not escape me by flight.<br>Therefore, make up thy mind for fight. If victorious, the sovereignty of<br>the earth will be thine, or if slain, heaven itself will be thine.'<br><br>'Thus addressed, king Duryodhana&#8212;that tiger among men surrounded by his<br>counsellors,&#8212;sighing on his car like a snake turned back, showered<br>arrows endued with the speed and force of thunderbolts. Beholding all<br>this, venerable sire, my thighs began to quake. Then that celestial youth<br>pierced with arrows the Kuru army consisting of leonine warriors. And<br>having pierced and afflicted that crowd of cars, that youth, stout as the<br>lion, laughed at them and robbed them of their clothes and attires.<br>Indeed, the six great car-warriors of the Kurus were vanquished by that<br>hero alone, even like herds of animals ranging in the forest by a single<br>tiger in rage.'<br><br>"Virata said, 'Where is that mighty-armed and famous youth of celestial<br>origin, that hero who recovered in battle my wealth that had been seized<br>by the Kurus? I am anxious to behold and worship that mighty warrior of<br>celestial origin who hath saved thee and my kine also.'<br><br>"Uttara replied, 'The mighty son of a deity disappeared there and then. I<br>think, however, that he will show himself either tomorrow or the day<br>after.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Virata, that owner of a large army, remained<br>ignorant of the son of Pandu who was thus described unto him by Uttara,<br>and who was living in the palace in disguise. And permitted by the<br>high-souled Virata, Partha presented with his own hands the garments he<br>had brought, unto Virata's daughter. And the beautiful Uttara, obtaining<br>those new and costly clothes of diverse kinds, became highly glad, along<br>with the son of the Matsya king.'"
