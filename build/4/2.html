                            Bhima said, "I intend to present myself before the lord of Virata as a<br>cook bearing the name of Vallabha. I am skilled in culinary art, and I<br>shall prepare curries for the king, and excelling all those skilful cooks<br>that had hitherto dressed his food I shall gratify the monarch. And I<br>shall carry mighty loads of wood. And witnessing that mighty feat, the<br>monarch will be pleased. And, O Bharata, beholding such superhuman feats<br>of mine, the servants of the royal household will honour me as a king.<br>And I shall have entire control over all kinds of viands and drinks. And<br>commanded to subdue powerful elephants and mighty bulls, I will do as<br>bidden. And if any combatants will fight with me in the lists, then will<br>I vanquish them, and thereby entertain the monarch. But I shall not take<br>the life of any of them. I shall only bring them down in such way that<br>they may not be killed. And on being asked as regards my antecedent I<br>shall say that&#8212;Formerly I was the wrestler and cook of Yudhishthira.<br>Thus shall I, O king, maintain myself."<br><br>Yudhishthira said, "And what office will be performed by that mighty<br>descendant of the Kurus, Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, that foremost of<br>men possessed of long arms, invincible in fight, and before whom, while<br>he was staying with Krishna, the divine Agni himself desirous of<br>consuming the forest of Khandava had formerly appeared in the guise of a<br>Brahmana? What office will be performed by that best of warriors, Arjuna,<br>who proceeded to that forest and gratified Agni, vanquishing on a single<br>car and slaying huge Nagas and Rakshasas, and who married the sister of<br>Vasuki himself, the king of the Nagas? Even as the sun is the foremost of<br>all heat-giving bodies, as the Brahmana is the best of all bipeds, as the<br>cobra is the foremost of all serpents, as Fire is the first of all things<br>possessed of energy, as the thunderbolt is the foremost of all weapons,<br>as the humped bull is the foremost of all animals of the bovine breed, as<br>the ocean is the foremost of all watery expanses, as clouds charged with<br>rain are the foremost of all clouds, as Ananta is the first of all Nagas,<br>as Airavata is the foremost of all elephants, as the son is the foremost<br>of all beloved objects, and lastly, as the wife is the best of all<br>friends, so, O Vrikodara, is the youthful Gudakesa, the foremost of all<br>bowmen. And O Bharata, what office will be performed by Vibhatsu, the<br>wielder of Gandiva, whose car is drawn by white horses, and who is not<br>inferior to Indra or Vasudeva Himself? What office will be performed by<br>Arjuna who, dwelling for five years in the abode of the thousand-eyed<br>Deity (Indra) shining in celestial lustre, acquired by his own energy the<br>science of superhuman arms with all celestial weapons, and whom I regard<br>as the tenth Rudra, the thirteenth Aditya, the ninth Vasu, and the tenth<br>Graha, whose arms, symmetrical and long, have the skin hardened by<br>constant strokes of the bowstring and cicatrices which resemble those on<br>the humps of bulls,&#8212;that foremost of warriors who is as Himavat among<br>mountains, the ocean among expanses of water, Sakra among the celestial,<br>Havya-vaha (fire) among the Vasus, the tiger among beasts, and Garuda<br>among feathery tribes!"<br><br>Arjuna replied, "O lord of the Earth, I will declare myself as one of the<br>neuter sex. O monarch, it is, indeed difficult to hide the marks of the<br>bowstring on my arms. I will, however, cover both my cicatrized arms with<br>bangles. Wearing brilliant rings on my ears and conch-bangles on my<br>wrists and causing a braid to hang down from my head, I shall, O king,<br>appear as one of the third sex, Brihannala by name. And living as a<br>female I shall (always) entertain the king and the inmates of the inner<br>apartments by reciting stories. And, O king, I shall also instruct the<br>women of Virata's palace in singing and delightful modes of dancing and<br>in musical instruments of diverse kinds. And I shall also recite the<br>various excellent acts of men and thus conceal myself, O son of Kunti, by<br>feigning disguise. And, O Bharata should the king enquire, I will say<br>that, I lived as a waiting maid of Draupadi in Yudhishthira's palace.<br>And, O foremost of kings, concealing myself by this means, as fire is<br>concealed by ashes, I shall pass my days agreeably in the palace of<br>Virata."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Having said this, Arjuna, that best of men and<br>foremost of virtuous persons, became silent. Then the king addressed<br>another brother of his."[2]
