                            "Bhishma said, 'Drona's son observeth well, and Kripa, too observeth<br>rightly. As for Kama, it is only out of regard for the duties of the<br>Kshatriya order that he desireth to fight. No man of wisdom can blame the<br>preceptor. I, however, am of opinion that fight we must, considering both<br>the time and the place. Why should not that man be bewildered who hath<br>five adversaries effulgent as five suns, who are heroic combatants and<br>who have just emerged from adversity? Even those conversant with morality<br>are bewildered in respect of their own interests. It is for this, O king,<br>that I tell thee this, whether my words be acceptable to you or not. What<br>Karna said unto thee was only for raising our (drooping) courage. As<br>regards thyself, O preceptor's son, forgive everything. The business at<br>hand is very grave. When the son of Kunti hath come, this is not the time<br>for quarrel. Everything should now be forgiven by thyself and the<br>preceptor Kripa. Like light in the sun, the mastery of all weapons doth<br>reside in you. As beauty is never separated from Chandramas, so are the<br>Vedas and the Brahma weapon both established in you. It is often seen<br>that the four Vedas dwell in one object and Kshatriya attributes in<br>another. We have never heard of these two dwelling together in any other<br>person than the preceptor of the Bharata race and his son. Even this is<br>what I think. In the Vedantas, in the Puranas, and in old histories, who<br>save Jamadagni, O king, would be Drona's superior? A combination of the<br>Brahma weapon with the Vedas,&#8212;this is never to be seen anywhere else. O<br>preceptor's son, do thou forgive. This is not the time for disunion. Let<br>all of us, uniting, fight with Indra's son who hath come. Of all the<br>calamities that may befall an army that have been enumerated by men of<br>wisdom, the worst is disunion among the leaders. Aswatthaman said, 'O<br>bull among men, these thy just observations, need not be uttered in our<br>presence; the preceptor, however, filled with wrath, had spoken of<br>Arjuna's virtues. The virtues of even an enemy should be admitted, while<br>the faults of even one's preceptor may be pointed out; therefore one<br>should, to the best of his power, declare the merits of a son or a<br>disciple.'<br><br>"Duryodhana said, 'Let the preceptor grant his forgiveness and let peace<br>be restored. If the preceptor be at one with us, whatever should be done<br>(in view of the present emergency) would seem to have been already done.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then, O Bharata, Duryodhana assisted by Kama<br>and Kripa, and the high-souled Bhishma pacified Drona.'<br><br>"Drona said, 'Appeased I have already been at the words first spoken by<br>Bhishma, the son of Santanu. Let such arrangements be made that Partha<br>may not be able to approach Duryodhana in battle. And let such<br>arrangements be made that king Duryodhana may not be captured by the foe,<br>in consequence either of his rashness or want of judgment. Arjuna hath<br>not, to be sure, revealed himself before the expiry of the term of exile.<br>Nor will he pardon this act (of ours) today, having only recovered the<br>kine. Let such arrangements, therefore, be made that he may not succeed<br>in attacking Dhritarashtra's son and defeating our troops. Like myself<br>(who am doubtful of the completion of period of exile) Duryodhana also<br>had said so before. Bearing it in mind, it behoveth the son of Ganga to<br>say what is true.'"
