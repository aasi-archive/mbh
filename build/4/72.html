                            "Virata said, 'Why, O best among the Pandavas, dost thou not wish to<br>accept as wife this my daughter that I bestow upon thee?'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'Residing in thy inner apartments, I had occasion always to<br>behold thy daughter, and she too, alone or in company trusted me as her<br>father. Well-versed in singing and dancing, I was liked and regarded by<br>her, and, indeed, thy daughter always regardeth me as her protector. O<br>king, I lived for one whole year with her though she had attained the age<br>of puberty. Under these circumstances, thyself or other men may not<br>without reason, entertain suspicions against her or me. Therefore, O<br>king, myself who am pure, and have my senses under control, beg to thee,<br>O monarch, thy daughter as my daughter-in-law. Thus do I attest her<br>purity. There is no difference between a daughter-in-law and a daughter,<br>as also between a son and son's own-self. By adopting this course,<br>therefore, her purity will be proved. I am afraid of slanderous and false<br>accusations. I accept, therefore, O king, thy daughter Uttara as my<br>daughter-in-law. Surpassing all in knowledge of weapons, resembling a<br>celestial youth in beauty, my son, the mighty-armed Abhimanyu is the<br>favourite nephew of Vasudeva, the wielder of the discus. He, O king, is<br>fit to be thy son-in-law and the husband of thy daughter.'<br><br>"Virata said, 'It behoveth the best of the Kurus, Dhananjaya, the son of<br>Kunti, who is so virtuous and wise, to say this. O son of Pritha, do thou<br>carry out what thou thinkest should be done after this. He that hath<br>Arjuna for the father of his son-in-law, hath all his desires gratified.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The monarch having said this, Yudhishthira, the<br>son of Kunti, gave his assent to what was thus agreed upon between the<br>Matsya king and Arjuna. And, O Bharata, the son of Kunti sent invitations<br>to Vasudeva and to all his friends and relatives, and Virata also did the<br>same. And then, after the expiry of the thirteenth year, the five<br>Pandavas took up their abode in one of Virata's towns called Upaplavya,<br>and Vibhatsu, the son of Pandu, brought over Abhimanyu and Janardana, and<br>also many people of the Dasarha race from the Anarta country. And the<br>king of Kasi, and also Saivya, being very friendly to Yudhishthira,<br>arrived there, each accompanied by an Akshauhini of troops. And the<br>mighty Drupada, also with the heroic sons of Draupadi and the<br>unvanquished Sikhandin, and that foremost of wielder of weapons, the<br>invincible Dhrishtadyumna came there with another Akshauhini of troops.<br>And all the kings that came were not only lords of Akshauhini, but<br>performers of sacrifices with gifts in profusion to Brahmanas, conversant<br>with the Vedas endued with heroism, and ready to die in battle. And<br>beholding them arrived, that foremost of virtuous men, the king of the<br>Matsyas, adored them duly, and entertained their troops and servants and<br>carriers of burdens. And he was highly pleased to bestow his daughter<br>upon Abhimanyu. And after the kings had come there from different parts<br>of the country, there came Vasudeva decked in floral garlands, and<br>Halayudha, and Kritavarman, the son of Hridika, and Yuyudhana, the son of<br>Satyaki, and Anadhristi and Akrura, and Samva and Nisatha. And these<br>repressers of foes came there bringing with them Abhimanyu and his<br>mother. And Indrasena and others, having lived at Dwaraka for one whole<br>year, came there, bringing with them the well adorned cars of the<br>Pandavas. And there came also ten thousand elephants and ten thousand<br>cars, and hundred millions of horses and hundred billions of<br>foot-soldiers, and innumerable Vrishni and Andhaka and Bhoja warriors of<br>great energy, in the train of that tiger among the Vrishnis, Vasudeva of<br>great effulgence. And Krishna gave unto each of the illustrious sons of<br>Pandu numerous female slaves, and gems and robes. And then the nuptial<br>festival set in between the families of the Matsya king and the Pandavas.<br>And then conchs and cymbals and horns and drums and other musical<br>instruments appointed by the Pandavas, began to play in the palace of<br>Virata. And deer of various kinds and clean animals by hundreds were<br>slain. And wines of various kinds and intoxicating juices of trees were<br>profusely collected. And mimes and bards and encomiasts, versed in<br>singing and legendary lore, waited upon the kings, and chanted their<br>praises and genealogies. And the matrons of the Matsyas of symmetrical<br>bodies and limbs, and wearing ear-rings of pearls and gems, headed by<br>Sudeshna, came to the place where the marriage knot was to be tied. And<br>amongst those beautiful females of fair complexion and excellent<br>ornaments, Krishna was the foremost in beauty and fame and splendour. And<br>they all came there, leading forth the princess Uttara decked in every<br>ornament and resembling the daughter of the great Indra himself. And then<br>Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, accepted Virata's daughter of faultless<br>limbs on behalf of his son by Subhadra. And that great king,<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, who stood there like Indra, also accepted<br>her as his daughter-in-law. And having accepted her, the son of Pritha,<br>with Janardana before him, caused the nuptial ceremonies to be performed<br>of the illustrious son of Subhadra. And Virata then gave him (as dowry)<br>seven thousand steeds endued with the speed of the wind and two hundred<br>elephants of the best kind and much wealth also. And having duly poured<br>libations of clarified butter on the blazing fire, and paid homage unto<br>the twice-born ones, Virata offered to the Pandavas his kingdom, army,<br>treasury, and his own self. And after the marriage had taken place,<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma, gave away unto the Brahmanas all the<br>wealth that had been brought by Krishna of unfading glory. And he also<br>gave away thousands of kine, and diverse kinds of robes, and various<br>excellent ornaments, and vehicles, and beds, delicious viands of various<br>kinds, and cardinal drinks of diverse species. And the king also made<br>gifts of land unto the Brahmanas with due rites, and also cattle by<br>thousands. And he also gave away thousands of steeds and much gold and<br>much wealth of other kinds, unto persons of all ages. And, O bull of the<br>Bharata race, the city of the Matsya king, thronged with men cheerful and<br>well-fed, shone brightly like a great festival.'"<br><br>The end of Virata Parva
