                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Having disorganised the hostile host by force and<br>having recovered the kine, that foremost of bowmen, desirous of fighting<br>again, proceeded towards Duryodhana. And beholding the kine running wild<br>towards the city of the Matsyas, the foremost warriors of the Kurus<br>regarded Kiritin to have already achieved success. And all of a sudden<br>they fell upon Arjuna who was advancing towards Duryodhana. And beholding<br>their countless divisions firmly arrayed in order of battle with<br>countless banners waving over them, that slayer of foes, addressing the<br>son of the king of the Matsyas, said, 'Urge on, to the best of their<br>speed by this road, these white steeds decked with golden bridles. Strive<br>thou well, for I would approach this crowd of Kuru lions. Like an<br>elephant desiring an encounter with another, the Suta's son of wicked<br>soul eagerly desireth a battle with me. Take me, O prince, to him who<br>hath grown so proud under the patronage of Duryodhana. Thus addressed,<br>the son of Virata by means of those large steeds endued with the speed of<br>the wind and furnished with golden armour, broke that array of cars and<br>took the Pandava into the midst of the battle-field. And seeing this<br>those mighty car-warriors, Chitrasena and Sangramajit and Satrusaha and<br>Jaya, desirous of aiding Karna, rushed with arrows and long shafts,<br>towards the advancing hero of Bharata's race. Then that foremost of men,<br>inflamed with wrath, began to consume by means of fiery arrows shot from<br>his bow, that array of cars belonging to those bulls among the Kurus,<br>like a tremendous conflagration consuming a forest. Then, when the battle<br>began to rage furiously, the Kuru hero, Vikarna, mounted on his car,<br>approached that foremost of car-warriors, Partha, the younger brother of<br>Bhima,&#8212;showering upon him terrible shafts thick and long. Then cutting<br>Vikarna's bow furnished with a tough string and horns overlaid with gold,<br>Arjuna cut off his flagstaff. And Vikarna, beholding his flagstaff cut<br>off, speedily took to flight. And after Vikarna's flight, Satruntapa,<br>unable to repress his ire, began to afflict Partha, that obstructer of<br>foes and achiever of super-human feats, by means of a perfect shower of<br>arrows. And drowned, as it were, in the midst of the Kuru-array, Arjuna,<br>pierced by that mighty car-warrior,&#8212;king Satruntapa&#8212;pierced the latter<br>in return with five and then slew his car-driver with ten shafts, and<br>pierced by that bull of the Bharata race with an arrow capable of<br>cleaving the thickest coat of mail, Satruntapa fell dead on the field of<br>battle, like a tree from a mountain-top torn up by the wind. And those<br>brave bulls among men, mangled in battle by that braver bull among men,<br>began to waver and tremble like mighty forests shaken by the violence of<br>the wind that blows at the time of the universal dissolution. And struck<br>in battle by Partha, the son of Vasava, those well-dressed heroes among<br>men&#8212;those givers of wealth endued with the energy of Vasava&#8212;defeated<br>and deprived of life, began to measure their lengths on the ground, like<br>full-grown Himalayan elephants clad in mails of black steel decked with<br>gold. And like unto a raging fire consuming a forest at the close of<br>summer, that foremost of men, wielding the Gandiva, ranged the field in<br>all directions, slaying his foes in battle thus. And as the wind rangeth<br>at will, scattering masses of clouds and fallen leaves in the season of<br>spring, so did that foremost of car-warriors&#8212;Kiritin&#8212;ranged in that<br>battle, scattering all his foes before him. And soon slaying the red<br>steeds yoked unto the car of Sangramajit, the brother of Vikatana's son,<br>that hero decked in diadem and endued with great vigour then cut off his<br>antagonist's head by a crescent-shaped arrow. And when his brother was<br>slain, Vikartana's son of the Suta caste, mustering all his prowess,<br>rushed at Arjuna, like a huge elephant with out-stretched tusks, or like<br>a tiger at a mighty bull. And the son of Vikarna quickly pierced the son<br>of Pandu with twelve shafts and all his steeds also in every part of<br>their bodies and Virata's son too in his hand. And rushing impetuously<br>against Vikarna's son who was suddenly advancing against him, Kiritin<br>attacked him fiercely like Garuda of variegated plumage swooping down<br>upon a snake. And both of them were foremost of bowmen, and both were<br>endued with great strength, and both were capable of slaying foes. And<br>seeing that an encounter was imminent between them, the Kauravas, anxious<br>to witness it, stood aloof as lookers on. And beholding the offender<br>Karna, the son of Pandu, excited to fury, and glad also at having him,<br>soon made him, his horses, his car, and car-driver invisible by means of<br>a frightful shower of countless arrows. And the warriors of the Bharatas<br>headed by Bhishma, with their horses, elephants, and cars, pierced by<br>Kiritin and rendered invisible by means of his shafts, their ranks also<br>scattered and broken, began to wail aloud in grief. The illustrious and<br>heroic Karna, however counteracting with numberless arrows of his own<br>those shafts by Arjuna's hand, soon burst forth in view with bow and<br>arrows like a blazing fire. And then there arose the sound of loud<br>clapping of hands, with the blare of conchs and trumpets and kettle-drums<br>made by the Kurus while they applauded Vikartana's son who filled the<br>atmosphere with the sound of his bow-string flapping against his fence.<br>And beholding Kiritin filling the air with the twang of Gandiva, and the<br>upraised tail of the monkey that constituted his flag and that terrible<br>creature yelling furiously from the top of his flagstaff, Karna sent<br>forth a loud roar. And afflicting by means of his shafts, Vikartana's son<br>along with his steeds, car and car-driver, Kiritin impetuously poured an<br>arrowy shower on him, casting his eyes on the grandsire and Drona and<br>Kripa. And Vikartana's son also poured upon Partha a heavy shower of<br>arrows like a rain-charged cloud. And the diadem-decked Arjuna also<br>covered Karna with a thick down-pour of keen-edged shafts. And the two<br>heroes stationed on their cars, creating clouds of keen-edged arrows in a<br>combat carried on by means of countless shafts and weapons, appeared to<br>the spectators like the sun and the moon covered by clouds, and the<br>light-handed Karna, unable to bear the sight of the foe, pierced the four<br>horses of the diadem-decked hero with whetted arrows, and then struck his<br>car-driver with three shafts, and his flagstaff also with three. Thus<br>struck, that grinder of all adversaries in battle, that bull of the Kuru<br>race, Jishnu wielding the Gandiva, like a lion awaked from slumber,<br>furiously attacked Kama by means of straight-going arrows. And afflicted<br>by the arrowy shower (of Karna), that illustrious achiever of super-human<br>deeds soon displayed a thick shower of arrows in return. And he covered<br>Karna's car with countless shafts like the sun covering the different<br>worlds with rays. And like a lion attacked by an elephant, Arjuna, taking<br>some keen crescent-shaped arrows from out of his quiver and drawing his<br>bow to his ear, pierced the Suta's son on every part of his body. And<br>that grinder of foes pierced Karna's arms and thighs and head and<br>forehead and neck and other principal parts of his body with whetted<br>shafts endued with the impetuosity of the thunderbolt and shot from the<br>Gandiva in battle. And mangled and afflicted by the arrows shot by Partha<br>the son of Pandu, Vikartana's son, quitted the van of battle, and quickly<br>took to flight, like one elephant vanquished by another.'"
