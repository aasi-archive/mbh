                            'Vaisampayana said, 'Having issued forth from the city, the dauntless son<br>of Virata addressed his charioteer, saying, 'Proceed whither the Kurus<br>are. Defeating the assembled Kurus who have come hither from desire of<br>victory, and quickly rescuing my kine from them. I will return to the<br>capital.' At these words of the prince, the son of Pandu urged those<br>excellent steeds. And endued with the speed of the wind and decked with<br>necklaces of gold, those steeds, urged by that lion among men, seemed to<br>fly through the air. And they had not proceeded far when those smiters of<br>foes, Dhananjaya and the son of Matsya, sighted the army of the powerful<br>Kurus. And proceeding towards the cemetary, they came upon the Kurus and<br>beheld their army arrayed in order of battle.[40] And that large army of<br>theirs looked like the vast sea or a forest of innumerable trees moving<br>through the sky. And then was seen, O best among the Kurus, the dust<br>raised by that moving army which reached the sky and obstructed the sight<br>of all creatures. And beholding that mighty host abounding in elephants,<br>horses and chariots, and protected by Karna and Duryodhana and Kripa and<br>Santanu's son, and that intelligent and great bowman Drona, with his son<br>(Aswatthaman), the son of Virata, agitated with fear and the bristles on<br>his body standing on their ends, thus spake unto Partha, 'I dare not<br>fight with the Kurus. See, the bristles on my body have stood on their<br>ends. I am incapable of battling with this countless host of the Kurus,<br>abounding in the heroic warriors, that are extremely fierce and difficult<br>of being vanquished even by the celestials. I do not venture to penetrate<br>into the army of the Bharatas consisting of terrible bowmen and abounding<br>in horses and elephants and cars and footsoldiers and banners. My mind is<br>too much perturbed by the very sight of the foe on the field of battle on<br>which stand Drona and Bhishma, and Kripa, and Karna, and Vivingsati, and<br>Aswatthaman and Vikarna, and Saumadatti, and Vahlika, and the heroic king<br>Duryodhana also&#8212;that foremost of car-warriors, and many other splendid<br>bowmen, all skilled in battle. My hairs have stood on their ends, and I<br>am fainting with fear at the very sight of these smiters, the Kurus<br>arrayed in order of battle.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'And the low-minded and foolish Uttara out of<br>folly alone, began to bewail (his fate) in the presence of the<br>high-spirited (Arjuna) disguised (as his charioteer) in these words, 'My<br>father hath gone out to meet the Trigartas taking with him his whole<br>army, leaving me in the empty city. There are no troops to assist me.<br>Alone and a mere boy who has not undergone much exercise in arms, I am<br>unable to encounter these innumerable warriors and all skilled in<br>weapons. Do thou, therefore, O Vrihannala, cease to advance!'<br><br>"Vrihannala said, 'Why dost thou look so pale through fear and enhance<br>the joy of thy foes? As yet thou hast done nothing on the field of battle<br>with the enemy. It was thou that hadst ordered me, saying, Take me<br>towards the Kauravas. I will, therefore, take thee, thither where those<br>innumerable flags are. I will certainly take thee, O mighty-armed one,<br>into the midst of the hostile Kurus, prepared to fight as they are for<br>the kine like hawks for meat. I would do this, even if I regarded them to<br>have come hither for battling for a much higher stake such as the<br>sovereignty of the earth. Having, at the time of setting out, talked<br>before both men and women so highly of thy manliness, why wouldst thou<br>desist from the fight? If thou shouldst return home without recapturing<br>the kine, brave men and even women, when they meet together, will laugh<br>at thee (in derision). As regards myself, I cannot return to the city<br>without having rescued the kine, applauded as I have been so highly by<br>the Sairindhri in respect of my skill in driving cars. It is for those<br>praises by the Sairindhri and for those words of thine also (that I have<br>come). Why should I not, therefore, give battle to the Kurus? (As regards<br>thyself), be thou still.'<br><br>"Uttara said, 'Let the Kurus rob the Matsyas off all their wealth. Let<br>men and women, O Vrihannala, laugh at me. Let my kine perish, let the<br>city be a desert. Let me stand exposed before my father. Still there is<br>no need of battle.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Saying this, that much affrighted prince decked<br>in ear-ring jumped down from his car, and throwing down his bow and<br>arrows began to flee, sacrificing honour and pride. Vrihannala, however,<br>exclaimed, 'This is not the practice of the brave, this flight of a<br>Kshatriya from the field of battle. Even death in battle is better than<br>flight from fear.' Having said this, Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, coming<br>down from that excellent car ran after that prince thus running away, his<br>own long braid and pure red garments fluttering in the air. And some<br>soldiers, not knowing that it was Arjuna who was thus running with his<br>braid fluttering in the air, burst out into laughter at the sight. And<br>beholding him thus running, the Kurus began to argue, 'Who is this<br>person, thus disguised like fire concealed in ashes? He is partly a man<br>and partly a woman. Although bearing a neuter form, he yet resembleth<br>Arjuna. His are the same head and neck, and his the same arms like unto a<br>couple of maces. And this one's gait also is like unto his. He can be<br>none else than Dhananjaya. As Indra is among the celestials, so<br>Dhananjaya is among men. Who else in this world than Dhananjaya, would<br>alone come against us? Virata left a single son of his in the empty city.<br>He hath come out from childishness and not from true heroism. It is<br>Uttara who must have come out of the city, having, without doubt, made as<br>a charioteer Arjuna, the son of Pritha, now living in disguise. It seems<br>that he is now flying away in panic at sight of our army. And without<br>doubt Dhananjaya runneth after him to bring him back.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Beholding the disguised son of Pandu, the<br>Kauravas, O Bharata, began to indulge in these surmises, but they could<br>not come to any definite conclusion. Meanwhile, Dhananjaya, hastily<br>pursuing the retreating Uttara, seized him by the hair within a hundred<br>steps. And seized by Arjuna, the son of Virata began to lament most<br>woefully like one in great affliction, and said, 'Listen, O good<br>Vrihannala, O thou of handsome waist. Turn thou quickly the course of the<br>car. He that liveth meeteth with prosperity. I will give thee a hundred<br>coins of pure gold and eight lapis lazuli of great brightness set with<br>gold, and one chariot furnished with a golden flag-staff and drawn by<br>excellent steeds, and also ten elephants of infuriate prowess. Do thou, O<br>Vrihannala, set me free.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed, that tiger among men laughingly<br>dragged Uttara who was almost deprived of his senses and who was uttering<br>these words of lamentation towards the car. And the son of Pritha then<br>addressed the affrighted prince who had nearly lost his senses, saying,<br>'If, O chastiser of foes, thou dost not venture to fight with enemy, come<br>thou and hold the reins of the steeds as I fight with the foe. Protected<br>by the might of my arms, penetrate thou yon formidable and invincible<br>array of cars guarded by heroic and mighty warriors. Fear not, O<br>chastiser of foes, thou art a Kshatriya and the foremost of royal<br>princess. Why dost thou, O tiger among men, succumb in the midst of the<br>foe? I shall surely fight with the Kurus and recover the kine,<br>penetrating into this formidable and inaccessible array of cars. Be thou<br>my charioteer, O best of men, I will fight with the Kurus.' Thus speaking<br>unto Uttara, the son of Virata, Vibhatsu, heretofore unconquered in<br>battle, for a while comforted him. And then the son of Pritha, that<br>foremost of smiters, raised on the car that fainting and reluctant prince<br>stricken with fear!'"
