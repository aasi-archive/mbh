                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Beholding that bull among men seated on the car in<br>the habit of a person of the third sex, driving toward the Sami tree,<br>having taken (the flying) Uttara up, all the great car-warriors of the<br>Kurus with Bhishma and Drona at their head, became affrighted at heart,<br>suspecting the comer to be Dhananjaya. And seeing them so dispirited and<br>marking also the many wonderful portents, that foremost of all wielders<br>of arms, the preceptor Drona, son of Bharadwaja, said, 'Violent and hot<br>are the winds that below, showering gravels in profusion. The sky also is<br>overcast with a gloom of ashy hue. The clouds present the strange sight<br>of being dry and waterless. Our weapons also of various kinds are coming<br>out of their cases. The jackals are yelling hideously affrighted at the<br>conflagrations on all sides.[41] The horses too are shedding tears, and<br>our banners are trembling though moved by none. Such being the<br>inauspicious indications seen, a great danger is at hand. Stay ye with<br>vigilance, Protect ye your own selves and array the troops in order of<br>battle. Stand ye, expecting a terrible slaughter, and guard ye well the<br>kine. This mighty bowman, this foremost of all wielders of weapons, this<br>hero that hath come in the habit of a person of the third sex, is the son<br>of Pritha. There is no doubt of this.' Then addressing Bhishma, the<br>preceptor continued, 'O offspring of the Ganges, apparelled as a woman,<br>this is Kiriti called after a tree, the son of the enemy of the<br>mountains, and having on his banner the sign of devastator of the gardens<br>of Lanka's lord. Vanquishing us he will surely take away the kine today!<br>[42] This chastiser of foes is the valiant son of Pritha surnamed<br>Savyasachin. He doth not desist from conflict even with the gods and<br>demons combined. Put to great hardship in the forest he cometh in wrath.<br>Taught by even Indra himself, he is like unto Indra in battle. Therefore,<br>ye Kauravas, I do not see any hero who can withstand him. It is said that<br>the lord Mahadeva himself, disguised in the attire of a hunter, was<br>gratified by this son of Pritha in battle on the mountains of Himavat.'<br>Hearing these words, Karna said, 'You always censure us by speaking on<br>the virtues of Falguna, Arjuna, however, is not equal to even a full<br>sixteenth part of myself or Duryodhana!' And Duryodhana said, 'If this be<br>Partha, O Radheya, then my purpose hath already been fulfilled, for then,<br>O king, if traced out, the Pandavas shall have to wander for twelve years<br>again. Or, if this one be any other person in a eunuch's garb, I will<br>soon prostrate him on the earth with keen-edged arrows.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The son of Dhritarashtra, O chastiser of foes,<br>having said this, Bhishma and Drona and Kripa and Drona's son all<br>applauded his manliness!'"
