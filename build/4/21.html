                            "Bhima said, 'Fie on the might of my arms and fie on the Gandiva of<br>Falguni, inasmuch as thy hands, red before, now become covered with<br>corns. I would have caused a carnage in Virata's court but for the fact<br>that Kunti's son eyed me (by way of forbidding it), or like a mighty<br>elephant. I would, without ado, have crushed the head of Kichaka<br>intoxicated with the pride of sovereignty. When, O Krishna, I beheld thee<br>kicked by Kichaka, I conceived at that instant a wholesale slaughter of<br>the Matsyas. Yudhishthira, however, forbade me by a glance, and, O<br>beauteous lady, understanding his intention I have kept quiet. That we<br>have been deprived of our kingdom, that I have not yet slain the Kurus,<br>that I have not yet taken the heads of Suyodhana and Karna, and Suvala's<br>son Sakuni, and the wicked Duhsasana, these acts and omissions, O lady,<br>are consuming every limb of mine. The thought of those abides in my heart<br>like a javelin implanted in it. O thou of graceful hips, do not sacrifice<br>virtue, and, O noble-hearted lady, subdue thy wrath. If king Yudhishthira<br>hear from thee such rebukes, he will surely put an end to his life. If<br>also Dhananjaya and the twins hear thee speak thus, even they will<br>renounce life. And if these, O slender-waisted maiden, give up life. I<br>also shall not be able to bear my own. In olden days Sarjati's daughter,<br>the beautiful Sukanya, followed into the forest Chyavana of Bhrigu's<br>race, whose mind was under complete control, and over whom, while engaged<br>in ascetic meditation, the ants had built a hill. Thou mayst have heard<br>that Indrasena also who in beauty was like unto Narayani herself,<br>followed her husband aged a thousand years. Thou mayst have heard that<br>Janaka's daughter Sita, the princess of Videha, followed her lord while<br>living in dense woods. And that lady of graceful hips, Rama's beloved<br>wife, afflicted with calamities and persecuted by the Rakshasas, at<br>length regained the company of Rama. Lopamudra also, O timid one, endued<br>with youth and beauty, followed Agastya, renouncing all the objects of<br>enjoyment unattainable by men. And the intelligent and faultless Savitri<br>also followed the heroic Satyavan, the son of Dyumatsena, alone into the<br>world of Yama. Even like these chaste and beautiful ladies that I have<br>named, thou, O blessed girl, bloomest with every virtue. Do thou spend a<br>short while more that is measured by even a half month. And when the<br>thirteenth year is complete, thou wilt (again) become the Queen regnant<br>of a king.' Hearing these words, Draupadi said, 'Unable, O Bhima, to bear<br>my griefs, it is from grief alone that I have shed these tears. I do not<br>censure Yudhishthira. Nor is there any use in dwelling on the past. O<br>Bhima of mighty strength, come quickly forward to the work of the hour. O<br>Bhima, Kaikeyi, jealous of my beauty, always pains me by her endeavours<br>to prevent the king from taking a fancy to me. And understanding this<br>disposition of hers, the wicked-souled Kichaka of immoral ways constantly<br>solicits me himself. Angry with him for this, but then suppressing my<br>wrath I answer that wretch deprived of sense by lust, saying, 'O Kichaka,<br>protect thyself. I am the beloved queen and wife of five Gandharvas.<br>Those heroes in wrath will slay thee that art so rash.' Thus addressed,<br>Kichaka of wicked soul replied unto me, saying, 'I have not the least<br>fear of the Gandharvas, O Sairindhri of sweet smiles. I will slay hundred<br>thousand Gandharvas, encountering them in battle. Therefore, O timid one,<br>do thou consent.' Hearing all this, I again addressed the lust-afflicted<br>Suta, saying, 'Thou art no match for those illustrious Gandharvas. Of<br>respectable percentage and good disposition, I ever adhere to virtue and<br>never wish for the death of any one. It is for this that thou I vest, O<br>Kichaka!' At this, that wight of wicked soul burst out into a loud<br>laughter. And it came to pass that Kaikeyi previously urged by Kichaka,<br>and moved by affection for her brother, and desirous of doing him a good<br>turn, despatched me to him, saying 'Do thou, O Sairindhri, fetch wine<br>from Kichaka's quarter's!' On beholding me the Suta's son at first<br>addressed me in sweet words, and when that failed, he became exceedingly<br>enraged, and intended to use violence. Understanding the purpose of the<br>wicked Kichaka, I speedily rushed towards the place where the king was.<br>Felling me on the ground the wretch then kicked me in the very presence<br>of the king himself and before the eyes of Kanka and many others,<br>including charioteers, and royal favourites, and elephant-riders, and<br>citizens. I rebuked the king and Kanka again and again. The king,<br>however, neither prevented Kichaka, nor inflicted any chastisement on<br>him. The principal ally of king Virata in war, the cruel Kichaka reft of<br>virtue is loved by both the king and the queen. O exalted one, brave,<br>proud, sinful, adulterous, and engrossed in all objects of enjoyment, he<br>earneth immense wealth (from the king), and robs the possessions of<br>others even if they cry in distress. And he never walketh in the path of<br>virtue, nor doth he any virtuous act. Of wicked soul, and vicious<br>disposition, haughty and villainous, and always afflicted by the shafts<br>of Kama, though repulsed repeatedly, if he sees me again, he will outrage<br>me. I shall then surely renounce my life. Although striving to acquire<br>virtue (on my death) your highly meritorious acts will come to naught. Ye<br>that are now obeying your pledge, ye will lose your wife. By protecting,<br>one's wife one's offspring are protected, and by protecting one's<br>offspring, one's own self is protected. And it is because one begets<br>one's own self in one's wife that the wife is called Jaya[15] by the<br>wise. The husband also should be protected by the wife, thinking,&#8212;How<br>else will he take his birth in my womb?&#8212;I have heard it from Brahmanas<br>expounding the duties of the several orders that a Kshatriya hath no<br>other duty than subduing enemies. Alas, Kichaka kicked me in the very<br>presence of Yudhishthira the Just, and also of thyself, O Bhimasena of<br>mighty strength. It was thou, O Bhima, that didst deliver me from the<br>terrible Jatasura. It was thou also that with thy brothers didst vanquish<br>Jayadratha. Do thou now slay this wretch also who hath insulted me.<br>Presuming upon his being a favourite of the king, Kichaka, O Bharata,<br>hath enhanced my woe. Do thou, therefore, smash this lustful wight even<br>like an earthen pot dashed upon a stone. If, O Bharata, tomorrow's sun<br>sheds his rays upon him who is the source of many griefs of mine, I<br>shall, surely, mixing poison (with some drink), drink it up,&#8212;for I never<br>shall yield to Kichaka. Far better it were, O Bhima, that I should die<br>before thee.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana Continued, 'Having said this, Krishna, hiding her face in<br>Bhima's breast began to weep. And Bhima, embracing her, consoled her to<br>the best of his power. And having abundantly consoled that<br>slender-waisted daughter of Drupada by means of words fraught with grave<br>reason and sense, he wiped with his hands her face flooded with tears.<br>And thinking of Kichaka and licking with his tongue the corners of his<br>mouth, Bhima, filled with wrath thus spake to that distressed lady.'"
