                            (Go-harana Parva)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Having listened to these words of his spies, king<br>Duryodhana reflected inwardly for some time and then addressed his<br>courtiers, saying, 'It is difficult to ascertain the course of events<br>definitely. Discern ye all, therefore, whither the sons of Pandu have<br>gone, of this thirteenth year which they are to pass undiscovered by us<br>all, the greater part hath already expired. What remains is by much the<br>smaller. If, indeed, the sons of Pandu can pass undiscovered what remains<br>of this year, devoted to the vow of truth as they are, they will then<br>have fulfilled their pledge. They will then return like mighty elephants<br>with temporal juice trickling down, or like snakes of virulent poison.<br>Filled with wrath, they will, without doubt, be inflicters of terrible<br>chastisement on the Kurus. It behoveth ye, therefore, to make such<br>efforts without loss of time as may induce the sons of Pandu, acquainted<br>as they are with the proprieties of time, and staying as they now are in<br>painful disguise, to re-enter the woods suppressing their rage. Indeed,<br>adopt ye such means as may remove all causes of quarrel and anxiety from<br>the kingdom, making it tranquil and foeless and incapable of sustaining a<br>diminution of territory.' Hearing these words of Duryodhana, Kama said,<br>'Let other spies, abler and more cunning, and capable of accomplishing<br>their object, quickly go hence, O Bharata. Let them, well-disguised,<br>wander through swelling kingdoms and populous provinces, prying into<br>assemblies of the learned and delightful retreats of provinces. In the<br>inner apartments of palaces, in shrines and holy spots, in mines and<br>diverse other regions, the sons of Pandu should be searched after with<br>well-directed eagerness. Let the sons of Pandu who are living in disguise<br>be searched after by well-skilled spies in large numbers, devoted to<br>their work, themselves well-disguised, and all well-acquainted with the<br>objects of their search. Let the search be made on the banks of rivers,<br>in holy regions, in villages and towns, in retreats of ascetics, in<br>delightful mountains and mountain-caves.' When Karna ceased, Duryodhana's<br>second brother Dussasana, wedded to a sinful disposition, then addressed<br>his eldest brother and said, 'O monarch, O lord of men, let those spies<br>only in whom we have confidence, receiving their rewards in advance, once<br>more go after the search. This and what else hath been said by Karna have<br>our fullest approval. Let all the spies engage themselves in the search<br>according to the directions already given. Let these and others engage in<br>the search from province to province according to approved rules. It is<br>my belief, however, that the track the Pandavas have followed or their<br>present abode or occupation will not be discovered. Perhaps, they are<br>closely concealed; perhaps, they have gone to the other side of the<br>ocean. Or, perhaps, proud as they are of their strength and Courage, they<br>have been devoured by wild beasts; or perhaps, having been overtaken by<br>some unusual danger, they have perished for eternity. Therefore, O prince<br>of the Kuru race, dispelling all anxieties from thy heart, achieve what<br>thou wilt, always acting according to thy energy.'"
