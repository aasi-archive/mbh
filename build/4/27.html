                            "Vaisampayana said, "Endued with mighty energy and possessed of great<br>discernment, Drona then said, 'Persons like the sons of Pandu never<br>perish nor undergo discomfiture. Brave and skilled in every science,<br>intelligent and with senses under control, virtuous and grateful and<br>obedient to the virtuous Yudhishthira, ever following in the wake of<br>their eldest brother who is conversant with the conclusions of policy and<br>virtue and profit, who is attached to them as a father, and who strictly<br>adhereth to virtue and is firm in truth,&#8212;persons like them that are thus<br>devoted to their illustrious and royal brother, who gifted with great<br>intelligence, never injureth any body and who in his turn himself obeyeth<br>his younger brothers, never perish in this way. Why, then, should not<br>(Yudhishthira) the son of Pritha possessing a knowledge of policy, be<br>able to restore the prosperity of his brothers who are so obedient and<br>devoted and high-souled? It is for this that they are carefully waiting<br>for the arrival of their opportunity. Men such as these never perish.<br>This is what I see by my intellect. Do, therefore, quickly and without<br>loss of time, what should now be done, after proper reflection. And let<br>also the abode which the sons of Pandu with souls under control as<br>regards every purpose of life, are to occupy, be now settled. Heroic and<br>sinless and possessed of ascetic merit, the Pandavas are difficult to be<br>discovered (within the period of non-discovery). Intelligent and<br>possessed of every virtue, devoted to truth and versed in the principles<br>of policy, endued with purity and holiness, and the embodiment of<br>immeasurable energy, the son of Pritha is capable of consuming (his foes)<br>by a glance alone of his eyes. Knowing all this, do what is proper. Let<br>us, therefore, once more search after them, sending Brahmanas and<br>Charanas, ascetics crowned with success, and others of this kind who may<br>have a knowledge of those heroes!'"
