                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Then Bhuminjaya, the eldest son of the king,<br>entered, and having worshipped the feet of his father approached Kanka.<br>And he beheld Kanka covered with blood, and seated on the ground at one<br>end of the court, and waited upon by the Sairindhri. And seeing this,<br>Uttara asked his father in a hurry, saying, 'By whom, O king, hath this<br>one been struck? By whom hath this sinful act been perpetrated?'<br><br>"Virata said, 'This crooked Brahmana hath been struck by me. He deserveth<br>even more than this. When I was praising thee, he praised that person of<br>the third sex.'<br><br>"Uttara said, 'Thou hast, O king, committed an improper act. Do thou<br>speedily propitiate him so that the virulent poison of a Brahmana's curse<br>may not consume thee to thy roots!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having heard the words of his son, Virata, that<br>enhancer of the limits of his kingdom, began to soothe Kunti's son, who<br>was like unto a fire hid in ashes, for obtaining his forgiveness. And<br>unto the king desirous of obtaining his pardon the Pandava replied, 'O<br>king, I have long ago forgiven it. Anger I have none. Had this blood from<br>my nostrils fallen on the ground, then, without doubt, thou, O monarch,<br>wouldst have been destroyed with thy kingdom. I do not, however, blame<br>thee, O king, for having struck an innocent person. For, O king, they<br>that are powerful generally act with unreasoning severity.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'When the bleeding had stopped, Vrihannala<br>entered (the council-room) and having saluted both Virata and Kanka,<br>stood silent. And the king, having appeased the chief of the Kurus, began<br>to praise, in Savyasachin's hearing, Uttara who had returned from the<br>battle. And the king said, 'O enhancer of the joys of Kekaya's princess,<br>in thee have I truly a son! I never had nor shall have, a son that is<br>equal to thee! How, indeed, couldst thou, O Child, encounter that Karna<br>who leaveth not a single mark unhit amongst even a thousand that he may<br>aim at all at once? How couldst thou, O child, encounter that Bhishma who<br>hath no equal in the whole world of men? How also couldst thou, O child,<br>encounter Drona, that foremost of all wielders of weapons, that preceptor<br>of the Vrishnis and Kauravas, twice-born one who may be regarded as the<br>preceptor of all the Kshatriyas? How couldst thou meet in battle the<br>celebrated Aswatthaman? How couldst thou, O child, encounter that<br>Duryodhana, the prince who is capable of piercing even a mountain with<br>his mighty arrows? My foes have all been thrashed. A delicious breeze<br>seems to blow around me. And since thou hast recovered in battle the<br>whole of my wealth that had been seized by the Kurus, it seems that all<br>those mighty warriors were struck with panic. Without doubt, thou, O bull<br>amongst men, has routed the foe and snatched away from them my wealth of<br>kine, like his prey from a tiger.'"
