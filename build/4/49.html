                            "Kripa said, 'O Radheya, thy crooked heart always inclineth to war. Thou<br>knowest not the true nature of things; nor dost thou take into account<br>their after-consequences. There are various kinds of expedients<br>inferrable from the scriptures. Of these, a battle hath been regarded by<br>those acquainted with the past, as the most sinful. It is only when time<br>and place are favourable that military operations can lead to success. In<br>the present instance, however, the time being unfavourable, no good<br>results will be deprived. A display of prowess in proper time and place<br>becometh beneficial. It is by the favourableness or otherwise (of time<br>and place) that the opportuneness of an act is determined. Learned men<br>can never act according to the ideas of a car-maker. Considering all<br>this, an encounter with Partha is not advisible for us. Alone he saved<br>the Kurus (from the Gandharvas), and alone he satiated Agni. Alone he led<br>the life of a Brahmacharin for five years (on the breast of Himavat).<br>Taking up Subhadra on his car, alone he challenged Krishna to single<br>combat. Alone he fought with Rudra who stood before him as a forester. It<br>was in this very forest that Partha rescued Krishna while she was being<br>taken away (by Jayadratha). It is he alone that hath, for five years,<br>studied the science of weapons under Indra. Alone vanquishing all foes he<br>hath spread the fame of the Kurus. Alone that chastiser of foes<br>vanquished in battle Chitrasena, the king of the Gandharvas and in a<br>moment his invincible troops also. Alone he overthrew in battle the<br>fierce Nivatakavachas and the Kalakhanchas, that were both incapable of<br>being slain by the gods themselves. What, however, O Kama, hath been<br>achieved by thee single-handed like any of the sons of Pandu, each of<br>whom had alone subjugated many lords of earth? Even Indra himself is<br>unfit to encounter Partha in battle. He, therefore, that desireth to<br>fight with Arjuna should take a sedative. As to thyself, thou desirest to<br>take out the fangs of an angry snake of virulent poison by stretching<br>forth thy right hand and extending thy forefinger. Or, wandering alone in<br>the forest thou desirest to ride an infuriate elephant and go to a boar<br>without a hook in hand. Or, rubbed over with clarified butter and dressed<br>in silken robes, thou desirest to pass through the midst of a blazing<br>fire fed with fat and tallow and clarified butter. Who is there that<br>would, binding his own hands and feet and tying a huge stone unto his<br>neck, cross the ocean swimming with his bare arms? What manliness is<br>there in such an act? O Kama, he is a fool that would, without, skill in<br>weapons and without strength, desire to fight with Partha who is so<br>mighty and skilled in weapons? Dishonestly deceived by us and liberated<br>from thirteen years' exile, will not the illustrious hero annihilate us?<br>Having ignorantly come to a place where Partha lay concealed like fire<br>hidden in a well, we have, indeed, exposed to a great danger. But<br>irresistible though he be in battle, we should fight against him. Let,<br>therefore, our troops, clad in mail, stand here arrayed in ranks and<br>ready to strike. Let Drona and Duryodhana and Bhishma and thyself and<br>Drona's son and ourselves, all fight with the son of Pritha. Do not O<br>Kama, act so rashly as to fight alone. If we six car-warriors be united,<br>we can then be a match for and fight with that son of Pritha who is<br>resolved to fight and who is as fierce as the wielder of the thunderbolt.<br>Aided by our troops arrayed in ranks, ourselves&#8212;great bowmen&#8212;standing<br>carefully will fight with Arjuna even as the Danavas encounter Vasava in<br>battle.'"
