                            "Draupadi said, 'This O Bharata, that I am going to tell thee is another<br>great grief of mine. Thou shouldst not blame me, for I tell thee this<br>from sadness of heart. Who is there whose grief is not enhanced at sight<br>of thee, O bull of the Bharata race, engaged in the ignoble office of a<br>cook, so entirely beneath thee and calling thyself as one of Vallava<br>caste? What can be sadder than this, that people should know thee as<br>Virata's cook, Vallava by name, and therefore one that is sunk in<br>servitude? Alas, when thy work of the kitchen is over, thou humbly<br>sittest beside Virata, calling thyself as Vallava the cook, then<br>despondency seizeth my heart. When the king of kings in joy maketh thee<br>fight with elephants, and the women of the inner apartments (of the<br>palace) laugh all the while, then I am sorely distressed. When thou<br>fightest in the inner apartments with lions, tigers, and buffaloes, the<br>princess Kaikeyi looking on, then I almost swoon away. And when Kaikeyi<br>and those maidservants, leaving their seats, come to assist me and find<br>that instead of suffering any injury in limbs mine is only a swoon, the<br>princess speaks unto her women, saying, 'Surely, it is from affection and<br>the duty begot of intercourse that this lady of sweet smiles grieveth for<br>the exceedingly powerful cook when he fights with the beasts. Sairindhri<br>is possessed of great beauty and Vallava also is eminently handsome. The<br>heart of woman is hard to know, and they, I fancy, are deserving of each<br>other. It is, therefore, likely that the Sairindhri invariably weepeth<br>(at such times) on account of her connection with her lover. And then,<br>they both have entered this royal family at the same time. And speaking<br>such words she always upbraideth me. And beholding me wroth at this, she<br>suspects me to be attached to thee.' When she speaketh thus, great is the<br>grief that I feel. Indeed, on beholding thee, O Bhima of terrible<br>prowess, afflicted with such calamity, sunk as I already am in grief on<br>account of Yudhishthira. I do not desire to live. That youth who on a<br>single car had vanquished all celestials and men, is now, alas, the<br>dancing master of king Virata's daughter. That Pritha's son of<br>immeasurable soul, who had gratified Agni in the forest of Khandava, is<br>now living in the inner apartments (of a palace) like fire hid in a well.<br>Alas, the bull among men, Dhananjaya, who was ever the terror of foes, is<br>now living in a guise that is despaired by all. Alas, he whose mace-like<br>arms have been cicatrized in consequence of the strokes of his<br>bow-string, alas that Dhananjaya is passing the days in grief covering<br>his wrists with bracelets of conchs. Alas, that Dhananjaya the twang of<br>whose bow-string and the sound of whose leathern fences made every foe<br>tremble, now entertains only gladdened women with his songs. Oh, that<br>Dhananjaya whose head was formerly decked with a diadem of solar<br>splendour, is now wearing braids ending in unsightly curls. O Bhima,<br>beholding that terrible bowman, Arjuna, now wearing braids and in the<br>midst of women, my heart is stricken with woe. That high-souled hero who<br>is master of all the celestial weapons, and who is the repository of all<br>the sciences, now weareth ear-rings (like one of the fair sex). That<br>youth whom kings of incomparable prowess could not overpower in fight,<br>even as the waters of the mighty ocean cannot overleap the continents, is<br>now the dancing-master of king Virata's daughters and waits upon them in<br>disguise. O Bhima, that Arjuna the clatter of whose car-wheels caused the<br>entire earth with her mountains and forests, her mobile and immobile<br>things to tremble, and whose birth dispelled all the sorrows of Kunti,<br>that exalted hero, that younger brother of thine, O Bhimasena, now maketh<br>me weep for him. Beholding him coming towards me, decked in golden<br>ear-rings and other ornaments, and wearing on the wrists bracelets of<br>conchs, my heart is afflicted with despondency. And Dhananjaya who hath<br>not a bowman equal unto him on earth in prowess, now passeth his days in<br>singing, surrounded by women. Beholding that son of Pritha who in virtue,<br>heroism and truth, was the most admired in the world, now living in the<br>guise of a woman, my heart is afflicted with sorrow. When I behold, the<br>godlike Partha in the music-hall like an elephant with rent temples<br>surrounded by she-elephants in the midst of females, waiting before<br>Virata the king of the Matsyas, then I lose all sense of directions.<br>Surely, my mother-in-law doth not know Dhananjaya to be afflicted with<br>such extreme distress. Nor doth she know that descendant of the Kuru<br>race, Ajatasatru, addicted to disastrous dice, to be sunk in misery. O<br>Bharata, beholding the youngest of you all, Sahadeva, superintending the<br>kine, in the guise of a cowherd, I grow pale. Always thinking of<br>Sahadeva's plight, I cannot, O Bhimasena, obtain sleep,&#8212;what to speak<br>you of the rest? I do not know, O mighty-armed one, what sin Sahadeva may<br>have committed for which that hero of unbaffled prowess suffereth such<br>misery. O foremost of the Bharatas, beholding that beloved brother of<br>thine, that bull among men, employed by Matsya in looking after his kine,<br>I am filled with woe. Seeing that hero of proud disposition gratifying<br>Virata, by living at the head of his cowherds, attired in robes dyed in<br>red. I am attacked with fever. My mother-in-law always applauds the<br>heroic Sahadeva as one possessed of nobility, excellent behaviour, and<br>rectitude of conduct. Ardently attached to her sons, the weeping Kunti<br>stood, embracing Sahadeva while he was about to set out (with us) for the<br>great forest. And she addressed me saying, "Sahadeva is bashful and<br>sweet-speeched, and virtuous. He is also my favourite child. Therefore, O<br>Yajnaseni, tend him in the forest day and night. Delicate and brave,<br>devoted to the king, and always worshipping his elder brother, do thou, O<br>Panchali, feed him thyself.' O Pandava, beholding that foremost of<br>warriors, Sahadeva, engaged in tending kine, and sleeping at night on<br>calf-skins, how can I bear to live? He again who is crowned with the<br>three attributes of beauty, arms, and intelligence, is now the<br>superintendent of Virata's steeds. Behold the change brought on by time.<br>Granthika (Nakula), at sight of whom hostile hosts fled from the field of<br>battle, now traineth horses in the presence of the king, driving them<br>with the speed. Alas, I now see that handsome youth wait upon the<br>gorgeously decked and excellent Virata, the king of the Matsyas, and<br>display horses before him. O son of Pritha, afflicted as I am with all<br>these hundred kinds of misery on account of Yudhishthira, why dost thou,<br>O chastiser of foes, yet deem me happy? Listen now to me, O son of Kunti,<br>as I tell thee of other woes far surpassing these. What can be sadder to<br>me than miseries so various as these should emaciate me while ye are<br>alive.'"
