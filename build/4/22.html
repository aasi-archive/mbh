                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Then all the relatives of Kichaka, arriving at that<br>place, beheld him there and began to wail aloud, surrounding him on all<br>sides. And beholding Kichaka with every limb mangled, and lying like a<br>tortoise dragged to dry ground from the water, all of them were overcome<br>with exceeding fright, and the bristles of their bodies stood on end. And<br>seeing him crushed all over by Bhima, like a Danava by Indra, they<br>proceeded to take him outside, for performing his funeral obsequies. And<br>then those persons of the Suta clan thus assembled together espied<br>Krishna of faultless limbs hard by, who stood reclining on a pillar. And<br>all the Kichakas assembled there, exclaimed, 'Let this unchaste woman be<br>slain for whom Kichaka hath himself lost his life. Or, without slaying<br>her here, let us cremate her with him that had lusted after her,&#8212;for it<br>behoveth us to accomplish in every way what is agreeable to that deceased<br>son of Suta.' And then they addressed Virata, saying, 'It is for her sake<br>that Kichaka hath lost his life. Let him, therefore, be cremated along<br>with her. It behoveth thee to grant this permission.' Thus addressed by<br>them, king Virata, O monarch, knowing fully well the prowess of the Suta<br>gave his assent to Sairindhri being burnt along with the Suta's son. And<br>at this, the Kichakas approaching the frightened and stupefied Krishna of<br>lotus-like eyes, seized her with violence. And binding that damsel of<br>slender-waist and placing her upon the bier, they set out with great<br>energy towards the cemetary. And, O king, while thus forcibly carried<br>towards the cemetary by those sons of the Suta tribe, the blameless and<br>chaste Krishna living under the protections of her lords, then wailed<br>aloud for the help of her husbands, saying, 'Oh, let Jaya, and Jayanta,<br>and Vijaya and Jayatsena, and Jayadvala listen to my words. The Sutas are<br>taking me away. Let those illustrious Gandharvas endued with speed of<br>hand, the clatter of whose cars is loud and the twang of whose bowstrings<br>in the midst of the mighty conflict are heard like the roar of thunder,<br>listen to my words,&#8212;the Sutas are taking me away!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing those sorrowful words and lamentations<br>of Krishna, Bhima, without a moment's reflection started up from his bed<br>and said, 'I have heard, O Sairindhri the words thou hast spoken. Thou<br>hast, therefore, O timid lady, no more fear at the hands of the Sutas.<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said this, the mighty-armed Bhima<br>desirous of slaying the Kichakas, began to swell his body. And carefully<br>changing his attire, he went out of the palace by a wrong egress. And<br>climbing over a wall by the aid of a tree, he proceeded towards the<br>cemetary whither the Kichakas had gone. And having leapt over the wall,<br>and gone out of the excellent city, Bhima impetuously rushed to where the<br>Sutas were. And, O monarch, proceeding towards the funeral pyre he beheld<br>a large tree, tall as palmyra-palm, with gigantic shoulders and withered<br>top. And that slayer of foes grasping with his arms that tree measuring<br>ten Vyamas, uprooted it, even like an elephant, and placed it upon his<br>shoulders. And taking up that tree with trunk and branches and measuring<br>ten Vyamas, that mighty hero rushed towards the Sutas, like Yama himself,<br>mace in hand. And by the impetus of his rush[18] banians and peepals and<br>Kinsukas falling down on the earth lay in clusters. And beholding that<br>Gandharva approach them like a lion in fury, all the Sutas trembling with<br>fear and greatly distressed, became panic-struck. And they addressed each<br>other, saying, 'Lo, the powerful Gandharva cometh hither, filled with<br>rage, and with an upraised tree in hand. Let Sairindhri, therefore, from<br>whom this danger of ours hath arisen, be set free.' And beholding the<br>tree that had been uprooted by Bhimasena, they set Draupadi free and ran<br>breathlessly towards the city And seeing them run away, Bhima, that<br>mighty son of the Wind-god, despatched, O foremost of kings, by means of<br>that tree, a hundred and five of them unto the abode of Yama, like the<br>wielder of the thunderbolt slaying the Danavas. And setting Draupadi free<br>from her bonds, he then, O king, comforted her. And that mighty-armed and<br>irrepressible Vrikodara, the son of Pandu, then addressed the distressed<br>princess of Panchala with face bathed in tears, saying, 'Thus, O timid<br>one, are they slain that wrong thee without cause. Return, O Krishna, to<br>the city. Thou hast no longer any fear; I myself will go to the Virata's<br>kitchen by another route.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'It was thus, O Bharata, that a hundred and five<br>of those Kichakas were slain. And their corpses lay on the ground, making<br>the place look like a great forest overspread with uprooted trees after a<br>hurricane. Thus fell those hundred and five Kichakas. And including<br>Virata's general slain before, the slaughtered Sutas numbered one hundred<br>and six. And beholding that exceedingly wonderful feat, men and women<br>that assembled together, were filled with astonishment. And the power of<br>speech, O Bharata, was suspended in every one.'"
