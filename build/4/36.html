                            "Uttara said, 'Firm as I am in the use of the bow, I would set out this<br>very day in the track of the kine if only some one skilled in the<br>management of horses becomes my charioteer. I do not, however, know the<br>man who may be my charioteer. Look ye, therefore, without delay, for a<br>charioteer for me that am prepared for starting. My own charioteer was<br>slain in the great battle that was fought from day to day for a whole<br>month or at least for eight and twenty nights. As soon as I get another<br>person conversant with the management of the steeds. I will immediately<br>set out, hoisting high my own standard. Penetrating into the midst of the<br>hostile army abounding with elephants and horses and chariots, I will<br>bring back the kine, having vanquished the Kurus who are feeble in<br>strength and weak in weapons. Like a second wielder of the thunderbolt<br>terrifying the Danavas, I will bring back the kine this very moment,<br>affrighting in battle Duryodhana and Bhishma and Karna and Kripa and<br>Drona with his son, and other mighty bowmen assembled for fight. Finding<br>none (to oppose), the Kurus are taking away the kine. What can I do when<br>I am not there? The assembled Kurus shall witness my prowess today. And<br>they shall say unto one another, 'Is it Arjuna himself who is opposing<br>us?' "Vaisampayana continued, 'Having heard these words spoken by the<br>prince, Arjuna fully acquainted with the import of everything, after a<br>little while cheerfully spake in private unto his dear wife of faultless<br>beauty, Krishna, the princess of Panchala, Drupada's daughter of slender<br>make, sprung from the (sacrificial) fire and endued with the virtues of<br>truthfulness and honesty and ever attentive to the good of her husbands.<br>And the hero said, 'Do thou, O beauteous one, at my request say unto<br>Uttara without delay, 'This Vrihannala was formerly the accomplished<br>resolute charioteer of Pandu's son (Arjuna). Tried in many a great<br>battle, even he will be thy charioteer.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words uttered by the prince over<br>and over again in the midst of the women, Panchali could not quietly bear<br>those allusions to Vibhatsu. And bashfully stepping out from among the<br>women, the poor princess of Panchala gently spake unto him these words,<br>'The handsome youth, looking like a mighty elephant and known by the name<br>of Vrihannala, was formerly the charioteer of Arjuna. A disciple of that<br>illustrious warrior, and inferior to none in use of the bow, he was known<br>to me while I was living with the Pandavas. It was by him that the reins<br>were held of Arjuna's excellent steeds when Agni consumed the forest of<br>Khandava. It was with him as charioteer that Partha conquered all<br>creatures at Khandava-prastha. In fact, there is no charioteer equal unto<br>him.'<br><br>"Uttara said, 'Thou knowest, O Sairindhri, this youth. Thou knowest, what<br>this one of the neuter sex may or may not be, I cannot, however, O<br>blessed one, myself request Vrihannala to hold the reins of my horses.'<br><br>"Draupadi said, 'Vrihannala, O hero, will without doubt, obey the words<br>of thy younger sister[35]&#8212;that damsel of graceful hips. If he consents<br>to be thy charioteer, thou wilt, without doubt, return, having vanquished<br>the Kurus and rescued thy kine.'<br><br>"Thus addressed by the Sairindhri, Uttara spake unto his sister, 'Go<br>thyself, O thou of faultless beauty, and bring Vrihannala hither?' And<br>despatched by her brother, she hastily repaired to the dancing-hall where<br>that strong-armed son of Pandu was staying in disguise.'"
