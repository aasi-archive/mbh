                            "Vaisampayana said, 'When the king of the Matsyas, anxious of recovering<br>the kine, had set out in pursuit of the Trigartas, Duryodhana with his<br>counsellors invaded the dominions of Virata. And Bhishma and Drona, and<br>Karna, and Kripa acquainted with the best of weapons, Aswatthaman, and<br>Suvala's son, and Dussasana, O lord of men, and Vivingsati and Vikarna<br>and Chitrasena endued with great energy, and Durmukha and Dussaha,&#8212;these<br>and many other great warriors, coming upon the Matsya dominion speedily<br>drove off the cowherds of king Virata and forcibly took away the kine.<br>And the Kauravas, surrounding all sides with a multitude of cars, seized<br>sixty thousands of kine. And loud was the yell of woe set up by the<br>cowherds smitten by those warriors in that terrible conflict. And the<br>chief of the cowherds, greatly affrighted speedily mounted on a chariot<br>and set out for the city, bewailing in affliction. And entering the city<br>of the king, he proceeded to the place, and speedily alighting from the<br>chariot, got in for relating (what had happened). And beholding the proud<br>son of Matsya, named Bhuminjaya, he told him everything about the seizure<br>of the royal kine. And he said, the Kauravas are taking away sixty<br>thousand kine. Rise, therefore, O enhancer of the kingdom's glory, for<br>brining back thy cattle. O prince, if thou art desirous of achieving (the<br>kingdom's) good set out thyself without loss of time. Indeed, the king of<br>the Matsyas left thee in the empty city. The king (thy father) boasteth<br>of thee in court, saying, 'My son, equal unto me, is a hero and is the<br>supporter of (the glory of) my race. My son is a warrior skilled in<br>arrows and weapons and is always possessed of great courage.'&#8212;Oh, let<br>the words of that lord of men be true! O chief of herd-owners, bring thou<br>back the kine after vanquishing the Kurus, and consume thou their troops<br>with the terrific energy of thy arrows. Do thou like a leader of<br>elephants rushing at a herd, pierce the ranks of the foe with straight<br>arrows of golden wings, discharged from thy bow. Thy bow is even like a<br>Vina. Its two ends represent the ivory pillows; its string, the main<br>chord; its staff, the finger-board; and the arrows shot from it musical<br>notes. Do thou strike in the midst of the foe that Vina of musical<br>sound.[34] Let thy steeds, O lord, of silvery hue, be yoked unto thy car,<br>and let thy standard be hoisted, bearing the emblem of the golden lion.<br>Let thy keen-edged arrows endued with wings of gold, shot by thy strong<br>arms, obstruct the path of those kings and eclipse the very sun.<br>Vanquishing all the Kurus in battle like unto the wielder of the<br>thunderbolt defeating the Asuras, return thou again to the city having<br>achieved great renown. Son of Matsya's king, thou art the sole refuge of<br>this kingdom, as that foremost of virtuous warriors, Arjuna is of the<br>sons of Pandu. Even like Arjuna of his brothers, thou art, without doubt,<br>the refuge of those dwelling within these dominions. Indeed, we, the<br>subject of this realm, have our protector in thee.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by the cowherd in the presence<br>of the females, in words breathing courage, the prince indulging in<br>self-commendation within the female apartments, spoke these words.'"
