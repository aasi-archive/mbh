                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Then that grandsire of the Bharatas, Bhishma the son<br>of Sutanu, conversant with the Vedas, acquainted with the proprieties of<br>time and place, and possessing a knowledge of every duty of morality,<br>after the conclusion of Drona's speech, applauded the words of the<br>preceptor and spake unto the Bharatas for their benefit these words<br>consistent with virtue, expressive of his attachment to the virtuous<br>Yudhishthira, rarely spoken by men that are dishonest, and always meeting<br>with the approbation of the honest. And the words that Bhishma spake were<br>thoroughly impartial and worshipped by the wise. And the grandsire of the<br>Kurus said, 'The words that the regenerate Drona acquainted with the<br>truth of every affair hath uttered, are approved by me. I have no<br>hesitation in saying so. Endued with every auspicious mark, observant of<br>virtuous vows, possessed of Vedic lore, devoted to religious observances,<br>conversant with various sciences, obedient to the counsels of the aged,<br>adhering to the vow of truth, acquainted with the proprieties of time,<br>observant of the pledge they have given (in respect of their exile), pure<br>in their behaviour, ever adhering to the duties of the Kshatria order,<br>always obedient to Kesava, high-souled, possessed of great strength, and<br>ever-bearing the burthens of the wise, those heroic ones can never wither<br>under misfortune. Aided by their own energy, sons of Pandu who are now<br>leading a life of concealment in obedience to virtue, will surely never<br>perish. It is even this that my mind surmiseth. Therefore, O Bharata, I<br>am for employing the aid of honest counsel in our behaviour towards the<br>sons of Pandu. It would not be the policy of any wise man to cause them<br>to be discovered now by means of spies,[21] what we should do unto the<br>sons of Pandu, I shall say, reflecting with the aid of the intellect.<br>Know that I shall say nothing from ill will to thee. People like me<br>should never give such counsels to him that is dishonest, for only<br>counsels (like those I would give) should be offered unto them that are<br>honest. Counsels, however, that are evil, should under no circumstances<br>be offered. He, O child, that is devoted to truth and obedient to the<br>aged, he, indeed, that is wise, while speaking in the midst of an<br>assembly, should under all circumstances speak the truth, if the<br>acquisition of virtue be an object with him. I should, therefore, say<br>that I think differently from all those people here, in respect of the<br>abode of Yudhishthira the just in this the thirteenth year of his exile.<br>The ruler, O child, of the city or the province where king Yudhishthira<br>resides cannot have any misfortune. Charitable and liberal and humble and<br>modest must the people be of the country where king Yudhishthira resides.<br>Agreeable in speech, with passions under control, observant of truth,<br>cheerful, healthy, pure in conduct, and skilful in work must the people<br>be of the country where king Yudhishthira resides. The people of the<br>place, where Yudhishthira is, cannot be envious or malicious, or vain, or<br>proud, but must all adhere to their respective duties. Indeed, in the<br>place where Yudhishthira resides, Vedic hymns will be chanted all around,<br>sacrifices will be performed, the last full libations will always be<br>poured, [22] and gifts to Brahmanas will always be in profusion. There<br>the clouds, without doubt, pour abundant rain, and furnished with good<br>harvest the country will ever be without fear. There the paddy will not<br>be without grain, fruits will not be bereft of juice, floral garlands<br>will not be without fragrance, and the conversation of men will always be<br>full of agreeable words. There where king Yudhishthira resides, the<br>breezes will be delicious, the meetings of men will always be friendly,<br>and cause of fear there will be none. There kine will be plentiful,<br>without any of them being lean-fleshed or weak, and milk and curds and<br>butter will all be savoury and nutritious. There where king Yudhishthira<br>resides, every kind of corn will be full of nutrition and every edible<br>full of flavour. There where king Yudhishthira resides, the objects of<br>all the senses, viz.,&#8212;taste, touch, smell, and hearing, will be endued<br>with excellent attributes. There where king Yudhishthira resides, the<br>sights and scenes will be gladdening. And the regenerate ones of that<br>place will be virtuous and steady in observing their respective duties.<br>Indeed, in the country where the sons of Pandu may have taken up their<br>abode during this thirteenth year of their exile, the people will be<br>contented and cheerful, pure in conduct and without misery of any kind.<br>Devoted to gods and guests and the worship of these with their whole<br>soul, they will be fond of giving away, and filled with great energy,<br>they will all be observant of eternal virtue. There where king<br>Yudhishthira resides, the people, eschewing all that is evil, will be<br>desirous of achieving only what is good. Always observant of sacrifices<br>and pure vows, and hating untruth in speech, the people of the place<br>where king Yudhishthira may reside will always be desirous of obtaining<br>what is good, auspicious and beneficial. There where Yudhishthira<br>resides, the people will certainly be desirous of achieving what is good,<br>and their hearts will always incline towards virtue, and their vows being<br>agreeable they themselves are ever-engaged in the acquisition of<br>religious merit. O child, that son of Pritha in whom are intelligence and<br>charity, the highest tranquillity and undoubted forgiveness, modesty and<br>prosperity, and fame and great energy and a love for all creatures, is<br>incapable of being found out (now that he hath concealed himself) even by<br>Brahmanas, let alone ordinary persons. The wise Yudhishthira is living in<br>close disguise in regions whose characteristics I have described.<br>Regarding his excellent mode of life, I dare not say anything more.<br>Reflecting well upon all this, do without loss of time what thou mayst<br>think to be beneficial, O prince of the Kuru race, if indeed, thou hast<br>any faith in me.'"
