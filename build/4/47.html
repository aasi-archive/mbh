                            "Vaisampayana said, 'King Duryodhana then, on the field of battle said<br>unto Bhishma, and unto Drona&#8212;that tiger among warriors, and unto<br>Kripa&#8212;that mighty car-warrior, these words, 'Both myself and Kama had<br>said this unto the preceptors[54] I refer to the subject again, for I am<br>not satisfied with having said it once. Even this was the pledge of the<br>sons of Pandu that if defeated (at dice) they would reside to our<br>knowledge in countries and woods for twelve years, and one more year<br>unknown to us. That thirteenth year, instead of being over, is yet<br>running. Vibhatsu, therefore, who is still to live undiscovered hath<br>appeared before us. And if Vibhatsu hath come before the term of exile is<br>at end, the Pandavas shall have to pass another twelve years in the<br>woods. Whether it is due to forgetfulness (on their part) induced by<br>desire of dominion, or whether it is a mistake of ours, it behoveth<br>Bhishma to calculate the shortness or excess (of the promised period).<br>When an object of desire may or may not be attained, a doubt necessarily<br>attaches to one of the alternatives, and what is decided in one way often<br>ends differently. [55] Even moralists are puzzled in judging of their own<br>acts. [56] As regards ourselves, we have come hither to fight with the<br>Matsyas and to seize their kine stationed towards the north. If,<br>meanwhile, it is Arjuna that hath come, what fault can attach to us? We<br>have come hither to fight against the Matsyas on behalf of the Trigartas;<br>and as numerous were the acts represented unto us of the oppressions<br>committed by the Matsyas. it was for this that we promised aid to the<br>Trigartas who were overcome with fear. And it was agreed between us that<br>they should first seize, on the afternoon of the seventh lunar day, the<br>enormous wealth of kine that the Matsyas have, and that we should, at<br>sunrise of the eighteen day of the moon, seize these kine when the king<br>of the Matsyas would be pursuing those first seized. It may be that the<br>Trigartas are now bringing a way the kine, or being defeated, are coming<br>towards us for negotiating with the king of the Matsyas. Or, it may be,<br>that having driven the Trigartas off, the king of the Matsyas, at the<br>head of this people and his whole army of fierce warriors, appeareth on<br>the scene and advanceth to make night-attacks upon us. It may be that<br>some one leader among them, endued with mighty energy, is advancing for<br>vanquishing us, or, it may be that the king himself of the Matsyas is<br>come. But be it the king of the Matsyas or Vibhatsu, we must all fight<br>him. Even this hath been our pledge. Why are all these of foremost<br>car-warriors,&#8212;Bhishma and Drona and Kripa and Vikarna and Drona's<br>son,&#8212;now sitting on their cars, panic-stricken? At present there is<br>nothing better than fighting. Therefore, make up your minds. If, for the<br>cattle we have seized, an encounter takes place with the divine wielder<br>himself of the thunderbolt or even with Yama, who is there that will be<br>liable to reach Hastinapura? Pierced by the shafts (of the foe), how will<br>the foot-soldiers, in flying through the deep forest with their backs on<br>the field, escape with life, when escape for the cavalry is doubtful?<br>Hearing these words of Duryodhana, Karna said, 'Disregarding the<br>preceptor, make all arrangements. He knoweth well the intentions of the<br>Pandavas and striketh terror in our hearts. I see that his affection for<br>Arjuna is very great. Seeing him only coming, he chanteth his praises.<br>Make ye such arrangements that our troops may not break. Everything is in<br>confusion for Drona's having only heard the neigh of (Arjuna's) steeds.<br>Make ye such arrangements that these troops, come to a distant land in<br>this hot season and in the midst of this mighty forest, may not fall into<br>confusion and be subjugated by the foe. The Pandavas are always the<br>special favourites of the preceptor. The selfish Pandavas have stationed<br>Drona amongst us. Indeed, he betrayeth himself by his speech. Who would<br>ever extol a person upon hearing the neigh only of his steeds? Horses<br>always neigh, whether walking or standing, the winds blow at all times;<br>and Indra also always showereth rain. The roar of the clouds may<br>frequently be heard. What hath Partha to do with these, and why is he to<br>be praised for these? All this (on Drona's part), therefore, is due only<br>to either the desire of doing good to Arjuna or to his wrath and hatred<br>towards us. Preceptors are wise, and sinless, and very kind to all<br>creatures. They, however, should never be consulted at times of peril. It<br>is in luxurious palaces, and assemblies and pleasure-gardens, that<br>learned men, capable of making speeches, seem to be in their place.<br>Performing many wonderful things, in the assembly, it is there that<br>learned men find their place, or even there where sacrificial utensils<br>and their proper placing and washing are needed. In a knowledge of the<br>lapses of others, in studying the characters of men, in the science of<br>horses and elephants and cars, in treating the diseases of asses and<br>camels and goats and sheeps and kine, in planning buildings and gateways,<br>and in pointing out the defects of food and drink, the learned are truly<br>in their own sphere. Disregarding learned men that extol the heroism of<br>the foe, make ye such arrangements that the foe may be destroyed. Placing<br>the kine securely, array the troops in order of battle. Place guards in<br>proper places so that we may fight the foe.'"
