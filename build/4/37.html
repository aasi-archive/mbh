                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Thus despatched by her elder brother, the far-famed<br>daughter of king Matsya, adorned with a golden necklace, ever obedient to<br>her brother and possessed of a waist slender as that of the wasp,[36]<br>endued with the splendour of Lakshmi herself,[37] decked with the plumes<br>of the peacock of slender make and graceful limbs, her hips encircled by<br>a zone of pearls, her eye-lashes slightly curved, and her form endued<br>with every grace, hastily repaired to the dancing-hall like a flash of<br>lightning rushing towards a mass of dark clouds.[38] And the faultless<br>and auspicious daughter of Virata, of fine teeth and slender-waist, of<br>thighs close unto each other and each like the trunk of an elephant, her<br>person embellished with an excellent garland, sought the son of Pritha<br>like a she-elephant seeking her mate. And like unto a precious gem or the<br>very embodiment of prosperity of Indra, of exceeding beauty and large<br>eyes, that charming and adored and celebrated damsel saluted Arjuna. And<br>saluted by her, Partha asked that maiden of close thighs and golden<br>complexion, saying 'What brings thee hither, a damsel decked in a<br>necklace of gold? Why art thou in such a hurry, O gazelle-eyed maiden?<br>Why is thy face, O beauteous lady, so cheerless? Tell me all this without<br>delay!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Beholding, O king, his friend, the princess of<br>large-eyes (in that plight), her friend (Arjuna) cheerfully enquired of<br>her (in these words) the cause of her arrival there and then. And having<br>approached that bull among men, the princess, standing in the midst of<br>her female attendants, the displaying proper modesty[39], addressed him,<br>saying, 'The kine of this realm, O Vrihannala, are being driven away by<br>the Kurus, and it is to conquer them that my brother will set out bow in<br>hand. Not long ago his own charioteer was slain in battle, and there is<br>none equal unto the one slain that can act as my brother's charioteer.<br>And unto him striving to obtain a charioteer, Sairindhri,<br><br>O Vrihannala, hath spoken about thy skill in the management of steeds.<br>Thou wert formerly the favourite charioteer of Arjuna, and it was with<br>thee that that bull among the sons of Pandu had alone subjugated the<br>whole earth. Do thou, therefore, O Vrihannala, act as the charioteer of<br>my brother. (By this time) our kine have surely been driven away by the<br>Kurus to a great distance. Requested by me if thou dost not act up to my<br>words, I who am asking this service of thee out of affection, will give<br>up my life!' Thus addressed by this friend of graceful hips, that<br>oppressor of foes, endued with immeasurable prowess, went into the<br>prince's presence. And like unto a she-elephant running after her young<br>one, the princess possessed of large eyes followed that hero advancing<br>with hasty steps like unto an elephant with rent temples. And beholding<br>him from a distance, the prince himself said, 'With thee as his<br>charioteer, Dhananjaya the son of Kunti had gratified Agni at the<br>Khandava forest and subjugated the whole world! The Sairindhri hath<br>spoken of thee to me. She knoweth the Pandavas. Do thou, therefore, O<br>Vrihannala, hold, as thou didst, the reins of my steeds, desirous as I am<br>of righting with the Kurus and rescuing my bovine wealth. Thou wert<br>formerly the beloved charioteer of Arjuna and it was with thee that that<br>bull among the sons of Pandu had alone subjugated the whole earth!' Thus<br>addressed, Vrihannala replied unto the prince, saying, 'What ability have<br>I to act as a charioteer in the field of battle? If it is song or dance<br>of musical instruments or such other things, I can entertain thee<br>therewith, but where is my skill for becoming a charioteer?'<br><br>"Uttara said, 'O Vrihannala, be thou a singer or a dancer, hold thou (for<br>the present), without loss of time, the reins of my excellent steeds,<br>mounting upon my car!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Although that oppressor of foes, the son of<br>Pandu, was acquainted with everything, yet in the presence of Uttara, he<br>began to make many mistakes for the sake of fun. And when he sought to<br>put the coat of mail on his body by raising it upwards, the large-eyed<br>maidens, beholding it, burst out into a loud laughter. And seeing him<br>quite ignorant of putting on armour, Uttara himself equipped Vrihannala<br>with a costly coat of mail. And casing his own person in an excellent<br>armour of solar effulgence, and hoisting his standard bearing the figure<br>of a lion, the prince caused Vrihannala to become his charioteer. And<br>with Vrihannala to hold his reins, the hero set out, taking with him many<br>costly bows and a large number of beautiful arrows. And his friend,<br>Uttara and her maidens then said unto Vrihannala, 'Do thou, O Vrihannala,<br>bring for our dolls (when thou comest back) various kinds of good and<br>fine cloths after vanquishing the Kurus assembled for battle of whom<br>Bhishma and Drona are foremost!' Thus addressed, Partha the son of Pandu,<br>in a voice deep as the roar of the clouds, smilingly said unto that bevy<br>of fair maidens. If, thus 'Uttara can vanquish those mighty warriors in<br>battle, I will certainly bring excellent and beautiful cloths.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said these words, the heroic Arjuna<br>urged the steeds towards the Kuru army over which floated innumerable<br>flags. Just, however, as they were starting elderly dames and maidens,<br>and Brahmanas of rigid vows, beholding Uttara seated on his excellent car<br>with Vrihannala as charioteer and under that great banner hoisted on<br>high, walked round the car to bless the hero. And the women said, 'Let<br>the victory that Arjuna treading like a bull had achieved of old on the<br>occasion of burning the forest of Khandava, be thine, O Vrihannala, when<br>thou encounterest the Kurus today with prince Uttara.'"
