                            "Vaisampayana said, 'And the ranks of those fierce bowmen, the Kurus,<br>looked like masses of clouds in the rainy season drifting before a gentle<br>wind. And close (to those ranks of foot-soldiers) stood the enemy's<br>horses ridden by terrible warriors. And there were also elephants of<br>terrible mien, looking resplendent in beautiful armour, ridden by skilled<br>combatants and urged on with iron crows and hooks. And, O king, mounted<br>on a beautiful car, Sakra came there accompanied by the celestials,&#8212;the<br>Viswas and Maruts. And crowded with gods, Yakshas, Gandharvas and Nagas,<br>the firmament looked as resplendent as it does when bespangled with the<br>planetary constellation in a cloudless night. And the celestials came<br>there, each on his own car, desirous of beholding the efficacy of their<br>weapons in human warfare, and for witnessing also the fierce and mighty<br>combat that would take place when Bhishma and Arjuna would meet. And<br>embellished with gems of every kind and capable of going everywhere at<br>the will of the rider, the heavenly car of the lord of the celestials,<br>whose roof was upheld by a hundred thousand pillars of gold with (a<br>central) one made entirely of jewels and gems, was conspicuous in the<br>clear sky. And there appeared on the scene three and thirty gods with<br>Vasava (at their head), and (many) Gandharvas and Rakshasas and Nagas and<br>Pitris, together with the great Rishis. And seated on the car of the lord<br>of the celestials, appeared the effulgent persons of king, Vasumanas and<br>Valakshas and Supratarddana, and Ashtaka and Sivi and Yayati and Nahusha<br>and Gaya and Manu and Puru and Raghu and Bhanu and Krisaswa and Sagara<br>and Nala. And there shone in a splendid array, each in its proper place<br>the cars of Agni and Isa and Soma and Varuna and Prajapati and Dhatri and<br>Vidhatri and Kuvera and Yama, and Alamvusha and Ugrasena and others, and<br>of the Gandharva Tumburu. And all the celestials and the Siddhas, and all<br>the foremost of sages came there to behold that encounter between Arjuna<br>and the Kurus. And the sacred fragrance of celestial garlands filled the<br>air like that of blossoming woods at the advent of spring. And the red<br>and reddish umbrellas and robes and garlands and chamaras of the gods, as<br>they were stationed there, looked exceedingly beautiful. And the dust of<br>the earth soon disappeared and (celestial) effulgence lit up everything.<br>And redolent of divine perfumes, the breeze began to soothe the<br>combatants. And the firmament seemed ablaze and exceedingly beautiful,<br>decked with already arrived and arriving cars of handsome and various<br>make, all illumined with diverse sorts of jewels, and brought thither by<br>the foremost of the celestials. And surrounded by the celestials, and<br>wearing a garland of lotuses and lilies the powerful wielder of the<br>thunderbolt looked exceedingly beautiful on his car. And the slayer of<br>Vala, although he steadfastly gazed at his son on the field of battle,<br>was not satiated with such gazing,'"
