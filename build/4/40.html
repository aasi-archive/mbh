                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Having reached that Sami tree, and having<br>ascertained Virata's son to be exceedingly delicate and inexperienced in<br>battle, Partha addressed him, saying, 'Enjoined by me, O Uttara, quickly<br>take down (from this tree) some bows that are there. For these bows of<br>thine are unable to bear my strength, my heavy weight when I shall grind<br>down horses and elephants, and the stretch of my arms when I seek to<br>vanquish the foe. Therefore, O Bhuminjaya, climb thou up this tree of<br>thick foliage, for in this tree are tied the bows and arrows and banners<br>and excellent coats of mail of the heroic sons of Pandu, viz.,<br>Yudhishthira and Bhima and Vibhatsu and the twins. There also is that bow<br>of great energy, the Gandiva of Arjuna, which singly is equal to many<br>thousands of other bows and which is capable of extending the limits of a<br>kingdom. Large like a palmyra tree, able to bear the greatest stress, the<br>largest of all weapons, capable of obstructing the foe, handsome, and<br>smooth, and broad, without a knot, and adorned with gold, it is stiff and<br>beautiful in make and beareth the heaviest weight. And the other bows<br>also that are there, of Yudhishthira and Bhima and Vibhatsu and the<br>twins, are equally mighty and tough.'"
