                            "Uttara said, 'O hero, mounting on this large car with myself as driver,<br>which division of the (hostile) army wouldst thou penetrate? Commanded by<br>thee, I would drive thee thither?'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'I am pleased with thee, O tiger among men. Thou hast no<br>cause of fear. I will rout all thy foes in battle, O great warrior, And,<br>O thou of mighty arms, be at thy ease. Accomplishing great and terrible<br>feats in the melee, I will fight with thy foes. Tie quickly all those<br>quivers to my car, and take (from among those) a sword of polished blade<br>and adorned with gold.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of Arjuna, Uttara cast off<br>all inactivity. And he speedily alighted from the tree, bringing with him<br>Arjuna's weapons. Then Arjuna addressed him, saying, 'Yes, I will fight<br>with the Kurus and recover thy kine. Protected by me, the top of this car<br>will be to thee as a citadel. The passages and alleys and other divisions<br>of this car will be the streets and edifices of that fortified city.<br>These my arms will be its ramparts and gateways. This treble pole and my<br>quiver will constitute defensive works inaccessible to the foe. This my<br>banner&#8212;single and grand&#8212;will it not alone be equal unto those of thy<br>city? This my bow-string will constitute the catapults and cannons for<br>vomiting forth missiles on the besiezing ghost. My excited wrath will<br>make that fortress formidable, and the clatter of my car-wheels&#8212;will it<br>not resemble the kettle-drums of thy capital? Ridden by myself wielding<br>the Gandiva, this car will be incapable of being vanquished by the<br>hostile host, O son of Virata, let thy fear be dispelled.'<br><br>"Uttara said, 'I am no longer afraid of these. I know thy steadiness in<br>battle, which is even like unto that of Kesava or Indra himself. But<br>reflecting on this, I am continually bewildered. Foolish as I am, I am<br>incapable of arriving at certain conclusion. By what distressful<br>circumstances could a person of such handsome limbs and auspicious signs<br>become deprived of manhood! Indeed, thou seemest to me to be Mahadeva, or<br>Indra, or the chief of the Gandharvas, dwelling in the guise only of one<br>of the third sex.'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'I tell thee truly that I am only observing this vow for a<br>whole year agreeable to the behest of my elder brother. O thou of mighty<br>arms, I am not truly one of the neuter sex, but I have adopted this vow<br>of eunuchism from subservience to another's will and from desire of<br>religious merit. O prince, know me now to have completed my vow.'<br><br>"Uttara said, 'Thou hast conferred a great favour on me today, for I now<br>find that my suspicion was not altogether unfounded. Indeed, such a<br>person as thou, O best of men, cannot be of the neuter sex. I have now an<br>ally in battle. I can now fight with the celestials themselves. My fears<br>have been dispelled. What shall I do? Command me now. Trained in driving<br>cars by a learned preceptor I will, O bull among men, hold the reins of<br>thy horses that are capable of breaking the ranks of hostile cars. Know<br>me, O bull among men, to be as competent a charioteer as Daruka of<br>Vasudeva, or Matali of Sakra. The horse that is yoked unto the right-hand<br>pole (of thy car) and whose hoofs as they light on the ground are<br>scarcely visible when running, is like unto Sugriva of Krishna. This<br>other handsome horse, the foremost of his race, that is yoked unto the<br>left pole, is, I regard, equal in speed to Meghapushpa. This (third)<br>beautiful horse, clad in golden mail, yoked unto the rear-pole on the<br>left, is, I regard, Sivya equal in speed to but superior in strength. And<br>this (fourth) horse, yoked to the rear-pole on the right, is regarded as<br>superior to Valahaka in speed and strength. This car is worthy of bearing<br>on the field of battle a bowman like thee, and thou also art worthy of<br>fighting on this car. This is what I think!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then Arjuna, endued with great energy, took off<br>the bracelets from his arms and wore on his hands a pair of beautiful<br>gloves embroidered with gold. And he then tied his black and curling<br>locks with a piece of white cloth. And seated on that excellent car with<br>face turned to the east, the mighty-armed hero, purifying his body and<br>concentrating his soul, recalled to his mind all his weapons. And all the<br>weapons came, and addressing the royal son of Partha, said, 'We are here,<br>O illustrious one. We are thy servants, O son of Indra.' And bowing unto<br>them, Partha received them unto his hands and replied unto them, saying,<br>'Dwell ye all in my memory.' And obtaining all his weapons, the hero<br>looked cheerful. And quickly stringing his bow, the Gandiva, he twanged<br>it. And the twang of that bow was as loud as the collision of two mighty<br>bulls. And dreadful was the sound that filled the earth, and violent was<br>the wind that blew on all sides. And thick was the shower of fallen<br>meteors [50] and all sides were enveloped in gloom. And the birds began<br>to totter in the skies and large trees began to shake. [51] And loud as<br>the burst of the thunder, the Kurus knew from that sound that it was<br>Arjuna that drew with his hands the string of his best of bows from his<br>car. And Uttara said, 'Thou, O best of Pandavas, art alone. These mighty<br>car-warriors are many. How wilt thou vanquish in battle all these that<br>are skilled in every kind of weapon? Thou, O son of Kunti, art without a<br>follower, while the Kauravas have many. It is for this, O thou of mighty<br>arms, that I stay beside thee, stricken with fear.' Bursting out into<br>loud laughter, Partha said unto him, 'Be not afraid, O hero, what<br>friendly follower had I while fighting with the mighty Gandharvas on the<br>occasion of the Ghoshayatra? Who was my ally while engaged in the<br>terrific conflict at Khandava against so many celestials and Danavas? Who<br>was my ally when I fought, on behalf of the lord of the celestials<br>against the mighty Nivatakavachas and the Paulomas! And who was my ally,<br>O child, while I encountered in battle innumerable kings at the<br>Swayamvara to the princess of Panchala? Trained in arms by the preceptor<br>Drona, by Sakra, and Vaisravana, and Yama, and Varuna, and Agni, and<br>Kripa, and Krishna of Madhu's race, and by the wielder of the Pinaka<br>(Siva), why shall I not fight with these? Drive thou my car speedily, and<br>let thy heart's fever be dispelled.'"
