                            "Vaisampayana said, 'After the Kauravas, O Bharata, had taken their stand<br>in this order, Arjuna, filling the air with the rattle and din of his<br>car, advanced quickly towards them. And the Kurus beheld his banner-top<br>and heard the rattle and din of his car as also the twang of the Gandiva<br>stretched repeatedly by him. And noting all this, and seeing that great<br>car-warrior&#8212;the wielder of the Gandiva&#8212;come, Drona spoke thus, 'That is<br>the banner-top of Partha which shineth at a distance, and this is the<br>noise of his car, and that is the ape that roareth frightfully. Indeed,<br>the ape striketh terror in the troops. And there stationed on that<br>excellent car, the foremost of car-warriors draweth that best of bows,<br>the Gandiva, whose twang is as loud as the thunder. Behold, these two<br>shafts coming together fall at my feet, and two others pass off barely<br>touching my ears. Completing the period of exile and having achieved many<br>wonderful feats, Partha saluteth me and whispereth in my ears. Endued<br>with wisdom and beloved of his relatives, this Dhananjaya, the son of<br>Pandu, is, indeed, beheld by us after a long time, blazing with beauty<br>and grace. Possessed of car and arrows, furnished with handsome fences<br>and quiver and conch and banner and coat of mail, decked with diadem and<br>scimitar and bow, the son of Pritha shineth like the blazing (Homa) fire<br>surrounded with sacrificial ladles and fed with sacrificial butter.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Beholding the Kurus ready for battle, Arjuna<br>addressing Matsya's son in words suitable to the occasion, said, 'O<br>charioteer, restrain thou the steeds at such a point whence my arrows may<br>reach the enemy. Meanwhile, let me see, where, in the midst of this army,<br>is that vile wretch of the Kuru race. Disregarding all these, and<br>singling out that vainest of princes I will fall upon his head, for upon<br>the defeat of that wretch the others will regard themselves as defeated.<br>There standeth Drona, and thereafter him his son. And there are those<br>great bowmen&#8212;Bhishma and Kripa and Kama. I do not see, however, the king<br>there. I suspect that anxious to save his life, he retreateth by the<br>southern road, taking away with him the kine. Leaving this array of<br>car-warriors, proceed to the spot where Suyodhana is. There will I fight,<br>O son of Virata, for there the battle will not be fruitless, Defeating<br>him I will come back, taking away the kine.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed, the son of Virata restrained<br>the steeds with an effort and turned them by a pull at the bridle from<br>the spot where those bulls of the Kuru race were, and urged them on<br>towards the place where Duryodhana was. And as Arjuna went away leaving<br>that thick array of cars, Kripa, guessing his intention, addressed his<br>own comrades, saying, 'This Vibhatsu desireth not to take up his stand at<br>a spot remote from the king. Let us quickly fall upon the flanks of the<br>advancing hero. When inflamed with wrath, none else, unassisted, can<br>encounter him in battle save the deity of a thousand eyes, or Krishna the<br>son of Devaki. Of what use to us would the kine be or this vast wealth<br>also, if Duryodhana were to sink, like a boat, in the ocean of Partha?'<br>Meanwhile, Vibhatsu, having proceeded towards that division of the army,<br>announced himself speedily by name, and covered the troops with his<br>arrows thick as locusts. And covered with those countless shafts shot by<br>Partha, the hostile warriors could not see anything, the earth itself and<br>the sky becoming overwhelmed therewith. And the soldiers who had been<br>ready for the fight were so confounded that none could even the flee from<br>the field. And beholding the light-handedness of Partha they all<br>applauded it mentally. And Arjuna then blew his conch which always made<br>the bristles of the foe stand erect. And twanging his best of bows, he<br>urged the creatures on his flagstaff to roar more frightfully. And at the<br>blare of his conch and the rattle of his car-wheels, and the twang of the<br>Gandiva, and the roar of the superhuman creatures stationed on his<br>flagstaff, the earth itself began to tremble. And shaking their upraised<br>tails and lowing together, the kine turned back, proceeding along the<br>southern road.'"
