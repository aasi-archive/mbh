                            "Vaisampayana said, 'And beholding the Sutas slain, the citizens went to<br>the king, and represented unto him what had happened, saying, 'O king,<br>those mighty sons of the Sutas have all been slain by the Gandharvas.<br>Indeed, they lie scattered on the earth like huge peaks of mountains<br>riven by thunder. Sairindhri also, having been set free, returneth to thy<br>palace in the city. Alas, O king, if Sairindhri cometh, thy entire<br>kingdom will be endangered. Sairindhri is endued with great beauty; the<br>Gandharvas also here exceedingly powerful. Men again, without doubt, are<br>naturally sexual. Devise, therefore, O king, without delay, such means<br>that in consequence of wrongs done to Sairindhri, thy kingdom may not<br>meet with destruction.' Hearing those words of theirs, Virata, that lord<br>of hosts, said unto them, 'Do ye perform the last rites of the Sutas. Let<br>all the Kichakas be burnt, in one blazing pyre with gems and fragrant<br>unguents in profusion.' And filled with fear, the king then addressed his<br>queen Sudeshna, saying, 'When Sairindhri comes back, do thou tell her<br>these words from me, 'Blessed be thou, O fair-faced Sairindhri. Go thou<br>whithersoever thou likest. The king hath been alarmed, O thou of graceful<br>hips, at the defeat already experienced at the hands of the Gandharvas.<br>Protected as thou art by the Gandharvas, I dare not personally say all<br>this to thee. A woman, however, cannot offend, and it is for this that I<br>tell thee all this through a woman.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus delivered by Bhimasena after the slaughter<br>of the Sutas, the intelligent and youthful Krishna relieved from all her<br>fears, washed her limbs and clothes in water, and proceeded towards the<br>city, like a doe frightened by a tiger. And beholding her, the citizens,<br>O king, afflicted with the fear of the Gandharvas fled in all directions.<br>And some of them went so far as to shut their eyes. And then, O king at<br>the gate of the kitchen, the princess of Panchala saw Bhimasena staying,<br>like an infuriate elephant of gigantic proportions. And looking upon him<br>with wonder-expanded eyes, Draupadi, by means of words intelligible to<br>them alone, said, 'I bow unto that prince of the Gandharvas, who hath<br>rescued me.' At these words of her, Bhima said, 'Hearing these words of<br>hers in obedience to whom those persons were hitherto living in the city,<br>they will henceforth range here, regarding themselves as freed from the<br>debt.'[19]<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then she beheld the mighty-armed Dhananjaya, in<br>the dancing-hall instructing king Virata's daughters in dancing. And<br>issuing with Arjuna from the dancing-hall, all those damsels came to<br>Krishna who had arrived there, and who had been persecuted so sorely, all<br>innocent though she was. And they said, 'By good luck also it is, O<br>Sairindhri, that thou hast been delivered from thy dangers. By good luck<br>it is that thou hast returned safe. And by good luck also it is that<br>those Sutas have been slain that had wronged thee, innocent though thou<br>art.' Hearing this, Virhannala said, 'How hast thou, O Sairindhri, been<br>delivered? And how have those sinful wretches been slain? I wish to learn<br>all this from thee exactly as it occurred.' Sairindhri replied, 'O<br>blessed Vrihannala, always passing thy days happily in the apartments of<br>the girls, what concern hast thou with Sairindhri's fate to say? Thou<br>hast no grief to bear that Sairindhri hath to bear! It is for this, that<br>thou askest me thus, distressed as I am in ridicule.' Thereat Vrihannala<br>said, 'O blessed one, Vrihannala also hath unparalleled sorrows of her<br>own. She hath become as low as a brute. Thou dost not, O girl, understand<br>this. I have lived with thee, and thou, too hast lived with us. When,<br>therefore, thou art afflicted with misery, who is it that will not, O<br>thou of beautiful hips, feel it? But no one can completely read another's<br>heart. Therefore it is, O amiable one, that thou knowest not my heart!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then Draupadi, accompanied by those girls<br>entered the royal abode, desirous of appearing before Sudeshna. And when<br>she came before the queen, Virata's wife addressed her at the command of<br>the king, saying, 'Do thou, O Sairindhri, speedily go whithersoever thou<br>likest. The king, good betide thee, hath been filled with fear at this<br>discomfiture at the hands of the Gandharvas. Thou art, O thou of graceful<br>eye-brows, young and unparalleled on earth in beauty. Thou art, besides,<br>an object of desire with men. The Gandharvas again, are exceedingly<br>wrathful.' Thereat Sairindhri said, 'O beauteous lady, let the king<br>suffer me to live here for only thirteen days more. Without doubt, the<br>Gandharvas also will be highly obliged at this. They will then convey me<br>hence and do what would be agreeable to Virata. Without doubt, the king,<br>by doing this, with his friends, will reap great benefit.'"
