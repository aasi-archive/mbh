                            "Draupadi said, 'What grief hath she not who hath Yudhishthira for her<br>husband? Knowing all my griefs, why dost thou ask me? The Pratikamin<br>dragged me to the court in the midst of an assembly of courtiers, calling<br>me a slave. That grief, O Bharata, consumeth me. What other princess,<br>save Draupadi, would live having suffered such intense misery? Who else,<br>save myself, could bear such second insult as the wicked Saindhava<br>offered me while residing in the forest? Who else of my position, save<br>myself, could live, having been kicked by Kichaka in the very sight of<br>the wicked king of the Matsyas? Of what value is life, O Bharata, when<br>thou, O son of Kunti, dost not think me miserable, although I am<br>afflicted with such woes? That vile and wicked wretch, O Bharata, known<br>by the name of Kichaka, who is the brother-in-law of king Virata and the<br>commander of his forces, every day, O tiger among men, addresses me who<br>am residing in the palace as a Sairindhri, saying, 'Do thou become my<br>wife.'&#8212;Thus solicited, O slayer of foes, by that wretch deserving to be<br>slain, my heart is bursting like a fruit ripened in season. Censure thou<br>that elder brother of thine addicted to execrable dice, through whose act<br>alone I have been afflicted with such woe. Who else, save him that is a<br>desperate gambler, would play, giving up kingdom and everything including<br>even myself, in order to lead a life in the woods? If he had gambled<br>morning and evening for many years together, staking nishkas by thousand<br>and other kinds of substantial wealth, still his silver, and gold, and<br>robes, and vehicles, and teams, and goats, and sheep, and multitudes of<br>steeds and mares and mules would not have sustained any diminution. But<br>now deprived of prosperity by the rivalry of dice, he sits dumb like a<br>fool, reflecting on his own misdeeds. Alas, he who, while sojourning, was<br>followed by ten thousand elephants adorned with golden garlands now<br>supports himself by casting dice. That Yudhishthira who at Indraprastha<br>was adored by kings of incomparable prowess by hundreds of thousands,<br>that mighty monarch in whose kitchen a hundred thousand maid-servants,<br>plate in hand, used every day to feed numerous guests day and night, that<br>best of liberal men, who gave (every day) a thousand nishkas, alas, even<br>he overwhelmed with woe in consequence of gambling which is the root of<br>all evil, now supporteth himself by casting dice. Bards and encomiasts by<br>thousands decked with ear-rings set with brilliant gems, and gifted with<br>melodious voice, used to pay him homage morning and evening. Alas, that<br>Yudhishthira, who was daily waited upon by a thousand sages of ascetic<br>merit, versed in the Vedas and having every desire gratified, as his<br>courtiers,&#8212;that Yudhishthira who maintained eighty-eight thousands of<br>domestic Snatakas with thirty maid-servants assigned unto each, as also<br>ten thousand yatis not accepting anything in gift and with vital seed<br>drawn up,&#8212;alas, even that mighty king now liveth in such guise. That<br>Yudhishthira who is without malice, who is full of kindness, and who<br>giveth every creature his due, who hath all these excellent attributes,<br>alas&#8212;even he now liveth in such guise. Possessed of firmness and<br>unbaffled prowess, with heart disposed to give every creature his due,<br>king Yudhishthira, moved by compassion, constantly maintained in his<br>kingdom the blind, the old, the helpless, the parentless and all others<br>in his dominions in such distress. Alas, that Yudhishthira becoming a<br>dependant and a servant of Matsya, a caster of dice in his court, now<br>calls himself Kanka. He unto whom while residing at Indraprastha, all the<br>rulers of earth used to pay timely tribute,&#8212;alas, even he now begs for<br>subsistence at another's hands. He to whom the kings of the earth were in<br>subjection,&#8212;alas, even that king having lost his liberty, liveth in<br>subjection to others. Having dazzled the entire earth like the sun by his<br>energy, that Yudhishthira, alas, is now a courtier of king Virata. O<br>Pandu's son, that Pandava who was respectfully waited upon in court by<br>kings and sages, behold him now waiting upon another. Alas, beholding<br>Yudhishthira a courtier sitting beside another and breathing adulatory<br>speeches to the other, who can help being afflicted with grief? And<br>beholding the highly wise and virtuous Yudhishthira, undeserving as he is<br>of serving others, actually serving another for sustenance, who can help<br>being afflicted with grief? And, O hero, that Bharata who was worshipped<br>in court by the entire earth, do thou now behold him worshipping another.<br>Why then, O Bharata, dost thou not regard me as one afflicted with<br>diverse miseries, like one forlorn and immersed in a sea of sorrow?'"
