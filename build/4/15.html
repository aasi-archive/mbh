                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Rejected thus by the princess, Kichaka, afflicted<br>with maddening lust and forgetting all sense of propriety, addressed<br>Sudeshna saying, 'Do thou, Kekaya's daughter, so act that thy Sairindhri<br>may come into my arms. Do thou, O Sudeshna, adopt the means by which the<br>damsel of the gait of an elephant may accept me; I am dying of absorbing<br>desire.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing his profuse lamentations, that gentle<br>lady, the intelligent queen of Virata, was touched with pity. And having<br>taken counsel with her own self and reflected on Kichaka's purpose and on<br>the anxiety of Krishna, Sudeshna addressed the Suta's son in these words,<br>'Do thou, on the occasion of some festival, procure viands and wines for<br>me. I shall then send my Sairindhri to thee on the pretence of bringing<br>wine. And when she will repair thither do thou in solitude, free from<br>interruption, humour her as thou likest. Thus soothed, she may incline<br>her mind to thee.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed, he went out of his sister's<br>apartments. And he soon procured wines well-filtered and worthy of a<br>king. And employing skilled cooks, he prepared many and various kinds of<br>choice viands and delicious drinks and many and various kinds of meat of<br>different degrees of excellence. And when all this had been done, that<br>gentle lady Sudeshna, as previously counselled by Kichaka, desired her<br>Sairindhri to repair to Kichaka's abode, saying, 'Get up, O Sairindhri<br>and repair to Kichaka's abode to bring wine, for, O beauteous lady, I am<br>afflicted with thirst.' Thereupon the Sairindhri replied, 'O princess, I<br>shall not be able to repair to Kichaka's apartments. Thou thyself<br>knowest, O queen, how shameless he is. O thou of faultless limbs, O<br>beauteous lady, in thy palace I shall not be able to lead a lustful life,<br>becoming faithless to my husbands. Thou rememberest, O gentle lady, O<br>beautiful one, the conditions I had set down before entering thy house. O<br>thou of tresses ending in graceful curls, the foolish Kichaka afflicted<br>by the god of desire, will, on seeing me, offer me insult. Therefore, I<br>will not go to his quarters. Thou hast, O princess, many maids under<br>thee. Do thou, good betide thee, send one of them. For, surely, Kichaka<br>will insult me.' Sudeshna said, 'Sent by me, from my abode, surely he<br>will not harm thee.' And having said this, she handed over a golden<br>vessel furnished with a cover. And filled with apprehension, and weeping,<br>Draupadi mentally prayed for the protection of the gods, and set out for<br>Kichaka's abode for fetching wine. And she said, 'As I do not know<br>another person save my husbands, by virtue of that Truth let Kichaka not<br>be able to overpower me although I may approach his presence.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'And that helpless damsel then adored Surya for<br>a moment. And Surya, having considered all that she urged, commanded a<br>Rakshasa to protect her invisibly. And from that time the Rakshasa began<br>to attend upon that blameless lady under any circumstances. And beholding<br>Krishna in his presence like a frightened doe, the Suta rose up from his<br>seat, and felt the joy that is felt by a person wishing to cross to the<br>other shore, when he obtains a boat.'"
