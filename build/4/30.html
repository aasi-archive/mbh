                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Discomfited before, O monarch, many a time and oft<br>by Matsya's Suta Kichaka aided by the Matsyas and the Salyas, the mighty<br>king of the Trigartas, Susarman, who owned innumerable cars, regarding<br>the opportunity to be a favourable one, then spoke the following words<br>without losing a moment. And, O monarch, forcibly vanquished along with<br>his relatives by the mighty Kichaka, king Susarman, eyeing Karna in<br>askance, spoke these words unto Duryodhana, 'My kingdom hath many a time<br>been forcibly invaded by the king of the Matsyas. The mighty Kichaka was<br>that king's generalissimo. Crooked and wrathful and of wicked soul, of<br>prowess famed over all the world, sinful in deeds and highly cruel, that<br>wretch, however, hath been slain by the Gandharvas, Kichaka being dead,<br>king Virata, shorn of pride and his refuge gone, will, I imagine, lose<br>all courage I think, we ought now to invade that kingdom, if it pleases<br>thee, O sinless one, as also the illustrious Karna and all the Kauravas.<br>The accident that hath happened is, I imagine, a favourable one for us.<br>Let us, therefore, repair to Virata's kingdom abounding in corn. We will<br>appropriate his gems and other wealth of diverse kinds, and let us go to<br>share with each other as regards his villages and kingdom. Or, invading<br>his city by force, let us carry off by thousands his excellent kine of<br>various species. Uniting, O king, the forces of the Kauravas and the<br>Trigartas, let us lift his cattle in droves. Or, uniting our forces well,<br>we will check his power by forcing him to sue for peace. Or, destroying<br>his entire host, we will bring Matsya under subjection. Having brought<br>him under subjection by just means, we will live in our kingdom happily,<br>while thy power also will, without doubt, be enhanced.' Hearing these<br>words of Susarman, Karna addressed the king, saying, 'Susarman hath<br>spoken well; the opportunity is favourable and promises to be profitable<br>to us. Therefore, if it pleases thee, O sinless one, let us, drawing up<br>our forces in battle array and marshalling them in divisions, speedily<br>set out. Or, let the expedition be managed as Saradwata's son Kripa, the<br>preceptor Drona, and the wise and aged grandsire of the Kurus may think.<br>Consulting with each other, let us, O lord of earth, speedily set out to<br>attain our end. What business have we with the sons of Pandu, destitute<br>as they are of wealth, might, and prowess? They have either disappeared<br>for good or have gone to the abode of Yama? We will, O king, repair<br>without anxiety to Virata's city, and plunder his cattle and other wealth<br>of diverse kinds.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Accepting these words of Karna, the son of<br>Surya, king Duryodhana speedily commanded his brother Dussasana, born<br>immediately after him and always obedient to his wishes, saying,<br>'Consulting with the elders, array without delay, our forces. We will,<br>with all the Kauravas go to the appointed place. Let also the mighty<br>warrior, king Susarman, accompanied by a sufficient force with vehicles<br>and animals, set out with the Trigartas for the dominions of Matsyas. And<br>let Susarman proceed first, carefully concealing his intention. Following<br>in their wake, we will set out the day after in close array, for the<br>prosperous dominions of king Matsya. Let the Trigartas, however, suddenly<br>repair to the city of Virata, and coming upon the cowherds, seize that<br>immense wealth (of kine). We also marching in two divisions, will seize<br>thousands of excellent kine furnished with auspicious marks.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then, O Lord of earth, those warriors, the<br>Trigartas, accompanied by their infantry of terrible prowess, marched<br>towards the south-eastern direction, intending to wage hostilities with<br>Virata from the desire of seizing his kine. And Susarman set out on the<br>seventh day of the dark fortnight for seizing the kine. And then, O king,<br>on the eighth day following of the dark fortnight, the Kauravas also<br>accompanied by all their troops, began to seize the kine by thousands."
