                            (Samayapalana Parva)<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'While living thus disguised in the city of the<br>Matsyas, what did those descendants of the Kuru race endued with great<br>prowess, do, O regenerate one!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Hear, O king, what those descendants of Kuru did<br>while they dwelt thus in disguise in the city of the Matsyas, worshipping<br>the king thereof. By the grace of the sage Trinavindu and of the<br>high-souled lord of justice, the Pandavas continued to live unrecognised<br>by others in the city of Virata. O lord of men, Yudhishthira, as courtier<br>made himself agreeable to Virata and his sons as also to all the Matsyas.<br>An adept in the mysteries of dice, the son of Pandu caused them to play<br>at dice according to his pleasure and made them sit together in the<br>dice-hall like a row of birds bound in a string. And that tiger among<br>men, king Yudhishthira the Just, unknown to the monarch, distributed<br>among his brothers, in due proportion, the wealth he won from Virata. And<br>Bhimasena on his part, sold to Yudhishthira for price, meat and viands of<br>various kinds which he obtained from the king. And Arjuna distributed<br>among all his brothers the proceeds of worn-out cloths which he earned in<br>the inner apartments of the palace. And Sahadeva, too, who was disguised<br>as a cowherd gave milk, curds and clarified butter to his brothers. And<br>Nakula also shared with his brothers the wealth the king gave him,<br>satisfied with his management of the horses. And Draupadi, herself in a<br>pitiable condition, looked after all those brothers and behaved in such a<br>way as to remain unrecognized. And thus ministering unto one another's<br>wants, those mighty warriors lived in the capital of Virata as hidden<br>from view, as if they were once more in their mother's womb. And those<br>lords of men, the sons of Pandu, apprehensive of danger from the son of<br>Dhritarashtra, continued to dwell there in concealment, watching over<br>their wife Draupadi. And after three months had passed away, in the<br>fourth, the grand festival in honour of the divine Brahma which was<br>celebrated with pomp in the country of the Matsyas, came off. And there<br>came athletes from all quarters by thousands, like hosts of celestials to<br>the abode of Brahma or of Siva to witness that festival. And they were<br>endued with huge bodies and great prowess, like the demons called<br>Kalakhanjas. And elated with their prowess and proud of their strength,<br>they were highly honoured by the king. And their shoulders and waists and<br>necks were like those of lions, and their bodies were very clean, and<br>their hearts were quite at ease. And they had many a time won success in<br>the lists in the presence of kings. And amongst them there was one who<br>towered above the rest and challenged them all to a combat. And there was<br>none that dared to approach him as he proudly stalked in the arena. And<br>when all the athletes stood sad and dispirited, the king of the Matsyas<br>made him fight with his cook. And urged by the king, Bhima made up his<br>mind reluctantly, for he could not openly disobey the royal behest. And<br>that tiger among men then having worshipped the king, entered the<br>spacious arena, pacing with the careless steps of a tiger. And the son of<br>Kunti then girded up his loins to the great delight of the spectators.<br>And Bhima then summoned to the combat that athlete known by the name of<br>Jimuta who was like unto the Asura Vritra whose prowess was widely known.<br>And both of them were possessed of great courage, and both were endued<br>with terrible prowess. And they were like a couple of infuriate and<br>huge-bodied elephants, each sixty years old. And those brave tigers among<br>men then cheerfully engaged in a wrestling combat, desirous of<br>vanquishing each other. And terrible was the encounter that took place<br>between them, like the clash of the thunderbolt against the stony<br>mountain-breast. And both of them were exceedingly powerful and extremely<br>delighted at each other's strength. And desirous of vanquishing each<br>other, each stood eager to take advantage of his adversary's lapse. And<br>both were greatly delighted and both looked like infuriate elephants of<br>prodigious size. And various were the modes of attack and defence that<br>they exhibited with their clenched fists.[12] And each dashed against the<br>other and flung his adversary to a distance. And each cast the other down<br>and pressed him close to the ground. And each got up again and squeezed<br>the other in his arms. And each threw the other violently off his place<br>by boxing him on the breast. And each caught the other by the legs and<br>whirling him round threw him down on the ground. And they slapped each<br>other with their palms that struck as hard as the thunderbolt. And they<br>also struck each other with their outstretched fingers, and stretching<br>them out like spears thrust the nails into each other's body. And they<br>gave each other violent kicks. And they struck knee and head against<br>head, producing the crash of one stone against another. And in this<br>manner that furious combat between those warriors raged on without<br>weapons, sustained mainly by the power of their arms and their physical<br>and mental energy, to the infinite delight of the concourse of<br>spectators. And all people, O king, took deep interest in that encounter<br>of those powerful wrestlers who fought like Indra and the Asura Vritra.<br>And they cheered both of them with loud acclamations of applause. And the<br>broad-chested and long-armed experts in wrestling then pulled and pressed<br>and whirled and hurled down each other and struck each other with their<br>knees, expressing all the while their scorn for each other in loud<br>voices. And they began to fight with their bare arms in this way, which<br>were like spiked maces of iron. And at last the powerful and mighty-armed<br>Bhima, the slayer of his foes, shouting aloud seized the vociferous<br>athlete by the arms even as the lion seizes the elephant, and taking him<br>up from the ground and holding him aloft, began to whirl him round, to<br>the great astonishment of the assembled athletes and the people of<br>Matsya. And having whirled him round and round a hundred times till he<br>was insensible, the strong-armed Vrikodara dashed him to death on the<br>ground. And when the brave and renowned Jimuta was thus killed, Virata<br>and his friends were filled with great delight. And in the exuberance of<br>his joy, the noble-minded king rewarded Vallava then and there with the<br>liberality of Kuvera. And killing numerous athletes and many other men<br>possessed of great bodily strength, he pleased the king very much. And<br>when no one could be found there to encounter him in the lists, the king<br>made him fight with tigers and lions and elephants. And the king also<br>made him battle with furious and powerful lions in the harem for the<br>pleasure of the ladies. And Arjuna, too, pleased the king and all the<br>ladies of the inner apartments by singing and dancing. And Nakula pleased<br>Virata, that best of kings, by showing him fleet and well-trained steeds<br>that followed him wherever he went. And the king, gratified with him,<br>rewarded him with ample presents. And beholding around Sahadeva a herd of<br>well-trained bullocks, Virata that bull among men, bestowed upon him also<br>wealth of diverse kinds. And, O king, Draupadi distressed to see all<br>those warriors suffer pain, sighed incessantly. And it was in this way<br>that those eminent persons lived there in disguise, rendering services<br>unto king Virata.'"
