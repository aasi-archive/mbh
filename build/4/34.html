                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Thus addressed by Yudhishthira Susarman was<br>overwhelmed with shame and hung down his head. And liberated (from<br>slavery), he went to king Virata, and having saluted the monarch, took<br>his departure. And the Pandavas also replying on the might of their own<br>arms, and endued with modesty and observant of vows, having slain their<br>enemies and liberated Susarman, passed that night happily on the field of<br>battle. And Virata gratified those mighty warriors, the sons of Kunti,<br>possessed of super-human prowess with wealth and honour. And Virata said,<br>"All these gems of mine are now as much mine as yours. Do ye according to<br>your pleasure live here happily. And ye smiter of foes in battle, I will<br>bestow on you damsels decked with ornaments, wealth in plenty, and other<br>things that ye may like. Delivered from perils today by your prowess, I<br>am now crowned with victory. Do ye all become the lords of the Matsyas.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'And when the king of the Matsyas had addressed<br>them thus, those descendants of the Kurus with Yudhishthira at their<br>head, joining their hands, severally replied unto him saying, 'We are<br>well-pleased with all that thou sayest, O monarch. We, however, have been<br>much gratified that thou hast today been freed from thy foes.' Thus<br>answered, that foremost of kings, Virata the lord of the Matsyas, again<br>addressed Yudhishthira, saying, 'Come, we will install thee in<br>sovereignty of the Matsyas. And we will also bestow on thee things that<br>are rare on earth and are objects of desire, for thou deservest<br>everything at our hands. O foremost of Brahmanas of the Vaiyaghra order I<br>will bestow on thee gems and kine and gold and rubies and pearls. I bow<br>unto thee. It is owing to thee that I once more behold today my sons and<br>kingdom. Afflicted and threatened as I had been with disaster and danger,<br>it is through thy prowess that I have not succumbed to the foe.' Then<br>Yudhishthira again addressed the Matsyas, saying, 'Well-pleased are we<br>with the delightful words that thou hast spoken. Mayst thou be ever<br>happy, always practising humanity towards all creatures. Let messengers<br>now, at thy command, speedily repair into the city, in order to<br>communicate the glad tidings to our friends, and proclaim thy victory.<br>Hearing these words of him, king Matsya ordered the messengers, saying,'<br>'Do ye repair to the city and proclaim my victory in battle. And let<br>damsels and courtesons, decked in ornaments, come out of the city with<br>every kind of musical instruments.' Hearing this command uttered by the<br>king of the Matsyas, the men, laying the mandate on their head, all<br>departed with cheerful hearts. And having repaired to the city that very<br>night, they proclaimed at the hour of sunrise the victory of the king<br>about the city-gates.'"
