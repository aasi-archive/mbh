                            "Uttara said, 'Indeed, these weapons adorned with gold, belonging to the<br>light-handed and high-souled Partha, look exceedingly beautiful. But<br>where are that Arjuna, the son of Pritha, and Yudhishthira of the Kuru<br>race, and Nakula, and Sahadeva, and Bhimasena, the sons of Pandu? Having<br>lost their kingdom at dice, the high-souled Pandavas, capable of<br>destroying all foes, are no longer heard of. Where also is Draupadi, the<br>princess of Panchala, famed as the gem among women, who followed the sons<br>of Pandu after their defeat at dice to the forest?'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'I am Arjuna, called also Partha. Thy father's courtier is<br>Yudhishthira and thy father's cook Vallava is Bhimasena, the groom of<br>horses is Nakula, and Sahadeva is in the cow-pen. And know thou that the<br>Sairindhri is Draupadi, for whose sake the Kichakas have been slain.'<br><br>"Uttara said, 'I would believe all this if thou canst enumerate the ten<br>names of Partha, previously heard by me!'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'I will, O son of Virata, tell thee my ten names. Listen<br>thou and compare them with what thou hadst heard before. Listen to them<br>with close attention and concentrated mind. They are Arjuna, Falguna,<br>Jishnu, Kiritin, Swetavahana, Vibhatsu, Vijaya, Krishna, Savyasachin and<br>Dhananjaya."<br><br>"Uttara said, 'Tell me truly why art thou called Vijaya, and why<br>Swetavahana. Why art thou named Krishna and why Arjuna and Falguna and<br>Jishnu and Kiritin and Vibhatsu, and for what art thou Dhananjaya and<br>Savyasachin? I have heard before about the origin of the several names of<br>that hero, and can put faith in thy words if thou canst tell me all about<br>them.'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'They called me Dhananjaya because I lived in the midst of<br>wealth, having subjugated all the countries and taking away their<br>treasures. They called me Vijaya because when I go out to battle with<br>invincible kings, I never return (from the field) without vanquishing<br>them. I am called Swetavahana because when battling with the foe, white<br>horses decked in golden armour are always yoked unto my car. They call me<br>Falguna because I was born on the breast of the Himavat on a day when the<br>constellation Uttara Falguna was on the ascendent. I am named Kiritin<br>from a diadem, resplendent like the sun, having been placed of old on my<br>head by Indra during my encounter with the powerful Danavas. I am known<br>as Vibhatsu among gods and men, for my never having committed a<br>detestable deed on the battle-field. And since both of my hands are<br>capable of drawing the Gandiva, I am known as Savyasachin among gods and<br>men. They call me Arjuna because my complexion is very rare within the<br>four boundaries of the earth and because also my acts are always<br>stainless. I am known among human beings and celestials by the name of<br>Jishnu, because I am unapproachable and incapable of being kept down, and<br>a tamer of adversaries and son of the slayer of Paka. And Krishna, my<br>tenth appellation, was given to me by my father out of affection towards<br>his black-skinned boy of great purity.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, "The son of Virata then, approaching nearer<br>saluted Partha and said, 'My name is Bhuminjaya, and I am also called<br>Uttara. It is by good luck, O Partha, that I behold thee. Thou art<br>welcome, O Dhananjaya. O thou with red eyes, and arms that are mighty and<br>each like unto the trunk of an elephant, it behoveth thee to pardon what<br>I said unto thee from ignorance. And as wonderful and difficult have been<br>the feats achieved by thee before, my fears have been dispelled, and<br>indeed the love I bear to thee is great.'"
