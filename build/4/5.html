                            Vaisampayana said, "Girding their waists with swords, and equipped with<br>finger-protectors made of iguana skins and with various weapons, those<br>heroes proceeded in the direction of the river Yamuna. And those bowmen<br>desirous of (speedily) recovering their kingdom, hitherto living in<br>inaccessible hills and forest fastnesses, now terminated their<br>forest-life and proceeded to the southern bank of that river. And those<br>mighty warriors endued with great strength and hitherto leading the lives<br>of hunters by killing the deer of the forest, passed through Yakrilloma<br>and Surasena, leaving behind, on their right, the country of the<br>Panchalas, and on their left, that of the Dasarnas. And those bowmen,<br>looking wan and wearing beards and equipped with swords, entered Matsya's<br>dominions leaving the forest, giving themselves out as hunters. And on<br>arriving at that country, Krishna addressed Yudhishthira, saying, 'We see<br>footpaths here, and various fields. From this it appears that Virata's<br>metropolis is still at a distance. Pass we here what part of the night is<br>still left, for great is my fatigue."<br><br>Yudhishthira answered, "O Dhananjaya of Bharata's race, do thou take up<br>Panchali and carry her. Just on emerging from this forest, we arrive at<br>the city."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Thereupon like the leader of a herd of<br>elephants, Arjuna speedily took up Draupadi, and on coming to the<br>vicinity of the city, let her down. And on reaching the city, Ruru's son<br>(Yudhishthira), addressed Arjuna, saying, 'Where shall we deposit our<br>weapons, before entering the city? If, O child, we enter it with our<br>weapons about us, we shall thereby surely excite the alarm of the<br>citizens. Further, the tremendous bow, the Gandiva, is known to all men,<br>so that people will, without doubt, recognise us soon. And if even one of<br>us is discovered, we shall, according to promise, have to pass another<br>twelve years in the forest.'"<br><br>Arjuna said, "Hard by yon cemetery and near that inaccessible peak is a<br>mighty Sami tree, throwing-about its gigantic branches and difficult to<br>ascend. Nor is there any human being, who, I think, O Pandu's son, will<br>espy us depositing our arms at that place. That tree is in the midst of<br>an out-of-the way forest abounding in beasts and snakes, and is in the<br>vicinity of a dreary cemetery. Stowing away our weapons on the Sami tree,<br>let us, O Bharata, go to the city, and live there, free from anxiety!"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Having O bull of the Bharata race spoken thus to<br>king Yudhishthira the just, Arjuna prepared to deposit the weapons (on<br>the tree). And that bull among the Kurus, then loosened the string of the<br>large and dreadful Gandiva, ever producing thundering twang and always<br>destructive of hostile hosts, and with which he had conquered, on a<br>single car, gods and men and Nagas and swelling provinces. And the<br>warlike Yudhishthira, that represser of foes, unfastened the undecaying<br>string of that bow with which he had defended the field of Kurukshstra.<br>And the illustrious Bhimasena unstrung that bow by means of which that<br>sinless one had vanquished in fight the Panchals and the lord of Sindhu,<br>and with which, during his career of conquest, he had, single-handed,<br>opposed innumerable foes, and hearing whose twang which was like unto the<br>roar of the thunder or the splitting of a mountain, enemies always fly<br>(in panic) from the field of battle. And that son of Pandu of coppery<br>complexion and mild speech who is endued with great prowess in the field,<br>and is called Nakula in consequence of his unexampled beauty in the<br>family, then unfastened the string of that bow with which he had<br>conquered all the regions of the west. And the heroic Sahadeva also,<br>possessed of a mild disposition, then united the string of that bow with<br>which he had subjugated the countries of the south. And with their bows,<br>they put together their long and flashing swords, their precious quivers,<br>and their arrows sharp as razors. And Nakula ascended the tree, and<br>deposited on it the bows and the other weapons. And he tied them fast on<br>those parts of the tree which he thought would not break, and where the<br>rain would not penetrate. And the Pandavas hung up a corpse (on the<br>tree), knowing that people smelling the stench of the corpse would<br>say&#8212;here sure, is a dead body, and avoid the tree from a distance. And<br>on being asked by the shepherds and cowherds regarding the corpse, those<br>repressers of foes said unto them, 'This is our mother, aged one hundred<br>and eighty years. We have hung up her dead body, in accordance with the<br>custom observed by our forefathers.' And then those resisters of foes<br>approached the city. And for purposes of non-discovery Yudhisthira kept<br>these (five) names for himself and his brothers respectively, viz., Jaya,<br>Jayanta, Vijaya, Jayatsena, and Jayatvala. Then they entered the great<br>city, with the view to passing the thirteenth year undiscovered in that<br>kingdom, agreeably to the promise (to Duryodhana)."
