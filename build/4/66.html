                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Having vanquished the Kurus in battle, that one with<br>eyes like those of a bull brought back that profuse cattle wealth of<br>Virata. And while the Dhritarashtra, after their rout, were going away, a<br>large number of Kuru-soldiers issuing out of the deep forest appeared<br>with slow steps before Partha, their hearts afflicted with fear. And they<br>stood before him with joined palms and with hair dishevelled. And<br>fatigued with hunger and thirst, arrived in a foreign land, insensible<br>with terror, and confused in mind, they all bowed down unto the son of<br>Pritha and said,&#8212;We are thy slaves.'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'Welcome, blessed be ye. Go ye away. Ye have no cause of<br>fear. I will not take the lives of them that are afflicted. Ye have my<br>assurance of protection.<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of assurance, the assembled<br>warriors greeted him with benedictions in praise of his achievements and<br>fame and wishing him long life. And the Kauravas were unable to confront<br>Arjuna while after routing the foe he proceeded towards the city of<br>Virata, like an elephant with rent temples. And having routed the whole<br>army of the Kuru like a violent wind scattering the clouds, that slayer<br>of foes, Partha, regardfully addressing the prince of Matsya, said, 'It<br>is known to thee alone, O child, that the sons of Pritha are all living<br>with thy father. Do not eulogise them upon entering the city, for then<br>the king of the Matsyas may hide himself in fear. On the other hand,<br>entering the city, do thou proclaim in the presence of thy father that<br>the deed is thy own, saying,&#8212;By me hath the army of the Kurus been<br>vanquished and by me have the kine been recovered from the foe!'<br><br>"Uttara said, 'The feat thou hast achieved is beyond my power. I do not<br>possess the ability to achieve it. I shall not, however, O Savyasachin,<br>discover thee to my father, as long as thou wilt not tell me to do it.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having vanquished the hostile army and wrested<br>the whole of the cattle wealth from the Kurus, Jishnu returned again to<br>the cemetery and having approached the same Sami tree stood there with<br>body mangled by the arrows of the enemy. Then that terrible monkey<br>blazing like fire ascended into the sky with those other creatures in the<br>flag-staff. And the illusion created (by Viswakarma) melted away and<br>Uttara's own banner bearing the device of a lion was set up on the car<br>again. And having replaced the arrows and quivers of those foremost of<br>the Kuru princes, and also that other weapon the (Gandiva) which enhances<br>the fierceness of a battle, the illustrious prince of Matsya set out for<br>the city with a glad heart, having Kiritin as his charioteer. And having<br>achieved an exceedingly mighty feat and slain the foe, Partha also, that<br>slayer of foes, binding his hair into a braid as before, took the reins<br>from Uttara's hands. And that illustrious hero entered the city of<br>Virata, with a cheerful heart rehabilitating himself as Vrihannala, the<br>car-driver of Uttara.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'When all the Kauravas utterly routed and<br>vanquished, set out in a dejected mood for Hastinapura, Falguna, on his<br>way back, addressed Uttara, saying, 'O prince, O hero of mighty arms,<br>seeing the kine escorted in advance of us by the cowherds, we shall enter<br>Virata's metropolis in the afternoon, having tended the steeds with drink<br>and a bath. Let the cowherds, despatched by thee, speedily repair to the<br>city with the good news and proclaim thy victory.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Agreeable to Arjuna's words, Uttara speedily<br>ordered the messengers, saying, 'Go ye and proclaim the king's victory.<br>The foe hath been routed, and the kine have been recovered. And the<br>Matsya and the Bharata princes having thus consulted together<br>re-approached the same Sami tree. And gratified with the victory they had<br>won, and arrived at the foot of the Sami tree, they wore on their persons<br>and took up on their car the ornaments and robes they had left there. And<br>having vanquished the whole hostile army and recovered the whole of the<br>wealth from the Kurus, the heroic son of Virata returned to the city with<br>Vrihannala as his car-driver.'"
