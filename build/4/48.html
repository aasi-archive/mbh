                            "Karna said, 'I behold all these blessed ones, looking as if alarmed and<br>panic-struck and unresolved and unwilling to fight. If he that is come is<br>the king of the Matsyas or Vibhatsu, even I will resist him as the banks<br>resist the swelling sea. Shot from my bow these straight and flying<br>arrows, like gliding snakes, are all sure of aim. Discharged by my light<br>hands, these keen-edged arrows furnished with golden wings shall cover<br>Partha all over, like locusts shrouding a tree. Strongly pressed by these<br>winged arrows, the bow-string will cause these my leathern fences to<br>produce sounds that will be heard to resemble those of a couple of<br>kettle-drums. Having been engaged in ascetic austerities for the (last)<br>eight and five years, Vibhatsu will strike me but mildly in this<br>conflict, and the son of Kunti having become a Brahmana endued with good<br>qualities, hath thus become a fit person to quietly receive shafts by<br>thousands shot by me. This mighty bowman is indeed, celebrated over the<br>three worlds. I, too, am, by no means, inferior to Arjuna, that foremost<br>of human beings. With golden arrows furnished with vulturine wings shot<br>on all sides, let the firmament seem today to swarm with fire-flies.<br>Slaying Arjuna in battle, I will discharge today that debt, difficult of<br>repayments, but promised of old by me unto Dhritarashtra's son. When man<br>is there, even amongst all the gods and the Asuras, that will endure to<br>stand in the teeth of the straight arrows shot from my bow? Let my flying<br>arrows, winged and depressed at the middle, present the spectacle of the<br>coursing of the fire-flies through the welkin. Hard though he be as<br>Indra's thunderbolt and possessed of the energy of the chief of the<br>celestials, I will surely grind Partha, even as one afflicts an elephant<br>by means of burning brands. A heroic and mighty car-warrior as he is, and<br>the foremost of all wielders of weapons I shall seize the unresisting<br>Partha, even like Garuda seizing a snake. Irresistible like fire, and fed<br>by the fuel of swords, darts, and arrows, the blazing Pandava-fire that<br>consumeth foes, will be extinguished even by myself who am like unto a<br>mighty cloud incessantly dropping an arrowy shower,&#8212;the multitude of<br>cars (I will lead) constituting its thunder, and the speed of my horses,<br>the wind in advance. Discharged from my bow, my arrows like venomous<br>snakes will pierce Partha's body, like serpent penetrating through an<br>ant-hill. Pierced with well-tempered and straight shafts endued with<br>golden wings and great energy, behold ye today the son of Kunti decked<br>like a hill covered with Karnikara flowers. Having obtained weapons from<br>that best of ascetics&#8212;the son of Jamadagni, I would, relying on their<br>energy, fight with even the celestials. Struck with my javelin, the ape<br>stationed on his banner-top shall fall down today on the ground, uttering<br>terrible cries. The firmament will today be filled with the cries of the<br>(super-human) creatures stationed in the flagstaff of the foe, and<br>afflicted by me, they will fly away in all directions. I shall today<br>pluck up by the roots the long-existing dart in Duryodhan's heart by<br>throwing Arjuna down from his car. The Kauravas will today behold Partha<br>with his car broken, his horses killed, his valour gone, and himself<br>sighing like a snake. Let the Kauravas, following their own will go away<br>taking this wealth of kine, or, if they wish, let them stay on their cars<br>and witness my combat.'"
