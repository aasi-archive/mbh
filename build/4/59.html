                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Then, O mighty king, Drona's son rushed to an<br>encounter with Arjuna in battle. And beholding his rush to the conflict<br>like a hurricane, showering shafts like a rain charged cloud Pritha's son<br>received him with a cloud of arrows. And terrible was the encounter<br>between them, like that between the gods and the Danavas. And they shot<br>arrows at each other like Virata and Vasava. And the welkin being<br>enveloped on all sides with arrows, the sun was completely hidden, and<br>the air itself was hushed. And, O conqueror of hostile cities, as they<br>assailed and struck each other, loud sounds arose as of bamboos on fire.<br>And, O king, Aswatthaman's horses being sorely afflicted by Arjuna, they<br>became bewildered and could not ascertain which way to go. And as<br>Pritha's son ranged on the field, the powerful son of Drona finding an<br>opportunity, cut off the string of the Gandiva with an arrow furnished<br>with a horse-shoe head And beholding that extraordinary feat of his, the<br>celestials applauded him highly. And exclaiming&#8212;'Well done'!&#8212;-'Well<br>done'! Drona and Bhishma, and Karna, and the mighty warrior Kripa, all<br>applauded that feat of his greatly. And the son of Drona, drawing his<br>excellent bow, pierced with his shafts, furnished with the feathers of<br>the Kanka bird, the breast of Partha, that bull among warriors.<br>Thereupon, with a loud laughter, the mighty-armed son of Pritha attached<br>a strong and fresh string to Gandiva. And moistening his bow-string with<br>the sweat that stood on his forehead resembling the crescent moon,<br>Pritha's son advanced towards his adversary, even as an infuriated leader<br>of a herd of elephants rusheth at another elephant. And the encounter<br>that took place between those two matchless heroes on the field of battle<br>was exceedingly fierce and made the bristles of the spectators stand on<br>their ends. And as those heroes endued with mighty energy fought on, the<br>two mighty elephants, the Kurus beheld them with wonder. And those brave<br>bulls among men assailed each other with arrows of snaky forms and<br>resembling blazing fires. And as the couple of quivers belonging to the<br>Pandava was inexhaustible, that hero was able to remain on the field<br>immovable as a mountain. And as Aswatthaman's arrows, in consequence of<br>his ceaseless discharge in that conflict, were quickly exhausted, it was<br>for this that Arjuna prevailed over his adversary. Then Karna, drawing<br>his large bow with great force twanged the bow-string. And thereupon<br>arose loud exclamation of 'Oh'! and 'Alas'! And Pritha's son, casting his<br>eyes towards the spot where that bow was twanged, beheld before him the<br>son of Radha. And at that sight his wrath was greatly excited. And<br>inflamed with ire and desirous of slaying Karna, that bull of the Kuru<br>race stared at him with rolling eyes. And, O king, beholding Partha turn<br>away from Aswatthaman's side, the Kuru warriors discharged thousands of<br>arrows on Arjuna. And the mighty-armed Dhananjaya, that conqueror of<br>foes, leaving Drona's son, all on a sudden rushed towards Karna. And<br>rushing towards Karna, with eyes reddened in anger the son of Kunti,<br>desirous of a single combat with him, said these words."
