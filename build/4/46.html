                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Making Uttara his charioteer, and circumambulating<br>the Sami tree, the son of Pandu set out taking all his weapons with him.<br>And that mighty car-warrior set out with Uttara as the driver of his car,<br>having taken down that banner with the lion's figure and deposited it at<br>the foot of the Sami tree. And he hoisted on that car his own golden<br>banner bearing the figure of an ape with a lion's tail, which was a<br>celestial illusion contrived by Viswakarman himself. For, as soon,<br>indeed, as he had thought of that gift of Agni, than the latter, knowing<br>his wish, ordered those superhuman creatures (that usually sat there) to<br>take their place in that banner. And furnished with a beautiful flag of<br>handsome make, with quivers attached to it, and adored with gold, that<br>excellent flag-staff of celestial beauty than quickly fell from the<br>firmament on his car. [52] And beholding that banner arrived on his car,<br>the hero circumambulated it (respectively). And then the ape-bannered<br>Vibhatsu, the son of Kunti, called also Swetavahana, with fingers cased<br>in leathern fences of the Iguana skin, and taking up his bow and arrows<br>set out in a northernly direction. And that grinder of foes, possessed of<br>great strength, then forcibly blew his large conch-shell, of thundering<br>sound, capable of making the bristles of foes to stand on their ends. And<br>at the sound of that conch, those steeds endued with swiftness dropped<br>down on the ground on their knees. And Uttara also, greatly affrighted,<br>sat down on the car. And thereupon the son of Kunti took the reins<br>himself and raising the steeds, placed them in their proper positions.<br>And embracing Uttara, he encouraged him also, saying, 'Fear not, O<br>foremost of princes, thou art, O chastiser of foes, a Kshatriya by birth.<br>Why, O tiger among men, dost thou become so dispirited in the midst of<br>foes? Thou must have heard before the blare of many conchs and the note<br>of many trumpets, and the roar also of many elephants in the midst of<br>ranks arrayed for battled. Why art thou, therefore, so dispirited and<br>agitated and terrified by the blare of this conch, as if thou wert an<br>ordinary person?'<br><br>"Uttara said, 'Heard have I the blare of many a conch and many a trumpet<br>and the roar of many an elephant stationed in the battle-array, but never<br>have I heard before the blare of such conch. Nor have I ever seen a<br>banner like this. Never before have I heard also the twang of a bow such<br>as this. Truly, sir, with the blare of this conch, the twang of this bow,<br>the superhuman cries of the creatures stationed on this banner, and the<br>battle of this car, my mind is greatly bewildered. My perception of the<br>directions also is confused, and my heart is painfully afflicted. The<br>whole firmament seemeth to me to have been covered by this banner, and<br>everything seemeth to be hidden from my view! My ears also have been<br>deafened by the twang of the Gandiva![53]<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'Firmly stand thou on the car, pressing thy feet on it, and<br>tightly catch hold of the bridles, for I will blow the conch again.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Arjuna then blew his conch again, that conch which<br>filled foes with grief and enhanced the joy of friends. And the sound was<br>so loud that it seemed to split hills and mountains, and pierce<br>mountain-caves and the cardinal points. And Uttara once again sat down on<br>the car, clinging to it in fear. And with the blare of the conch and the<br>rattle of the car-wheels, and the twang of the Gandiva, the earth itself<br>seemed to tremble. And beholding Uttara's fight, Dhananjaya began to<br>comfort him again.'<br><br>"Meanwhile, Drona said, 'From the rattle of the car, and from the manner<br>in which the clouds have enveloped the sky and the earth itself trembles,<br>this warrior can be none else than Savyasachin. Our weapons do not shine,<br>our steeds are dispirited, and our fires, though fed with fuel, do not<br>blare up. All this is ominous. All our animals are setting up a frightful<br>howl, gazing towards the sun. The crows are perching on our banners. All<br>this is ominous. Yon vultures and kites on our right portend a great<br>danger. That jackal also, running through our ranks, waileth dismally.<br>Lo, it hath escaped unstruck. All this portends a heavy calamity. The<br>bristles also of ye all are on their ends. Surely, this forebodes a great<br>destruction of Kshatriyas in battle. Things endued with light are all<br>pale; beasts and birds look fierce; and there are to be witnessed many<br>terrific portents indicative of the destruction of Kshatriyas. And these<br>omens forebode great havoc among ourselves. O king, thy ranks seem to be<br>confounded by these blazing meteors, and thy animals look dispirited and<br>seem to be weeping. Vultures and kites are wheeling all around thy<br>troops. Thou shalt have to repent upon beholding thy army afflicted by<br>Partha's arrows. Indeed, our ranks seem to have been already vanquished,<br>for none is eager to go to fight. All our warriors are of pale face, and<br>almost deprived of their senses. Sending the kine ahead we should stand<br>here, ready to strike, with all our warriors arrayed in order of battle."
