                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Next appeared at the gate of the ramparts another<br>person of enormous size and exquisite beauty decked in the ornaments of<br>women, and wearing large ear-rings and beautiful conch-bracelets overlaid<br>with gold. And that mighty-armed individual with long and abundant hair<br>floating about his neck, resembled an elephant in gait. And shaking the<br>very earth with his tread, he approached Virata and stood in his court.<br>And beholding the son of the great Indra, shining with exquisite lustre<br>and having the gait of a mighty elephant,&#8212;that grinder of foes having<br>his true form concealed in disguise, entering the council-hall and<br>advancing towards the monarch, the king addressed all his courtiers,<br>saying, 'Whence doth this person come? I have never heard of him before.'<br>And when the men present spoke of the newcomer as one unknown to them,<br>the king wonderingly said, 'Possessed of great strength, thou art like<br>unto a celestial, and young and of darkish hue, thou resemblest the<br>leader of a herd of elephants. Wearing conch-bracelets overlaid with<br>gold, a braid, and ear-rings, thou shinest yet like one amongst those<br>that riding on chariots wander about equipped with mail and bow and<br>arrows and decked with garlands and fine hair. I am old and desirous of<br>relinquishing my burden. Be thou like my son, or rule thou like myself<br>all the Matsyas. It seemeth to me that such a person as thou can never be<br>of the neuter sex.'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'I sing, dance, and play on instruments. I am proficient in<br>dance and skilled in song. O lord of men, assign me unto (the princess)<br>Uttara. I shall be dancing-master to the royal maiden. As to how I have<br>come by this form, what will it avail thee to hear the account which will<br>only augment my pain? Know me, O king of men, to be Vrihannala, a son or<br>daughter without father or mother.'<br><br>"Virata said, 'O Vrihannala, I give thee what thou desirest. Instruct my<br>daughter, and those like her, in dancing. To me, however, this office<br>seemeth unworthy of thee. Thou deserves! (the dominion of) the entire<br>earth girt round by the ocean.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The king of the Matsyas then tested Vrihannala<br>in dancing, music, and other fine arts, and consulting with his various<br>ministers forthwith caused him to be examined by women. And learning that<br>this impotency was of a permanent nature, he sent him to the maiden's<br>apartments. And there the mighty Arjuna began giving lessons in singing<br>and instrumental music to the daughter of Virata, her friends, and her<br>waiting-maids, and soon won their good graces. And in this manner the<br>self-possessed Arjuna lived there in disguise, partaking of pleasures in<br>their company, and unknown to the people within or without the palace.'"
