                            Vaisampayana said, "And while Yudhishthira was on his way to the<br>delightful city of Virata, he began to praise mentally the Divine Durga,<br>the Supreme Goddess of the Universe, born on the womb of Yasoda, and fond<br>of the boons bestowed on her by Narayana, sprung from the race of cowherd<br>Nanda, and the giver of prosperity, the enhancer (of the glory) of (the<br>worshipper's) family, the terrifier of Kansa, and the destroyer of<br>Asuras,&#8212;and saluted the Goddess&#8212;her who ascended the skies when dashed<br>(by Kansa) on a stony platform, who is the sister of Vasudeva, one who is<br>always decked in celestial garlands and attired in celestial robes,&#8212;who<br>is armed with scimitar and shield, and always rescues the worshipper sunk<br>in sin, like a cow in the mire, who in the hours of distress calls upon<br>that eternal giver of blessings for relieving him of their burdens. And<br>the king, desirous with his brothers of obtaining a sight of the Goddess,<br>invoked her and began to praise her by reciting various names derived<br>from (approved) hymns. And Yudhishthira said, 'Salutations to thee, O<br>giver of boons. O thou that art identical with Krishna, O maiden, O thou<br>that hast observed the vow of Brahmacharya, O thou of body bright as the<br>newly-risen Sun, O thou efface beautiful as the full moon. Salutations to<br>thee, O thou of four hands and four faces, O thou of fair round hips and<br>deep bosom, O thou that wearest bangles made of emeralds and sapphires, O<br>thou that bearest excellent bracelets on thy upper arm. Thou shinest, O<br>Goddess, as Padma, the consort of Narayana. O thou that rangest the<br>etherial regions, thy true form and thy Brahmacharya are both of the<br>purest kind. Sable as the black clouds, thy face is beautiful as that of<br>Sankarshana. Thou bearest two large arms long as a couple of poles raised<br>in honour of Indra. In thy (six) other arms thou bearest a vessel, a<br>lotus, a bell, a noose, a bow, a large discus, and various other weapons.<br>Thou art the only female in the universe that possesses! the attribute of<br>purity. Thou art decked with a pair of well-made ears graced with<br>excellent rings. O Goddess, thou shinest with a face that challengeth the<br>moon in beauty. With an excellent diadem and beautiful braid with robes<br>made of the bodies of snakes, and with also the brilliant girdle round<br>thy hips, thou shinest like the Mandara mountain encircled with snakes.<br>Thou shinest also with peacock-plumes standing erect on thy head, and<br>thou hast sanctified the celestial regions by adopting the vow of<br>perpetual maiden-hood. It is for this, O thou that hast slain the<br>Mahishasura, [9] that thou art praised and worshipped by the gods for the<br>protection of the three worlds. O thou foremost of all deities, extend to<br>me thy grace, show me thy mercy, and be thou the source of blessings to<br>me. Thou art Jaya and Vijaya, and it is thou that givest victory in<br>battle. Grant me victory, O Goddess, and give me boons also at this hour<br>of distress. Thy eternal abode is on Vindhya&#8212;that foremost of mountains.<br>O Kali, O Kali, thou art the great Kali, ever fond of wine and meat and<br>animal sacrifice. Capable of going everywhere at will, and bestowing<br>boons on thy devotees, thou art ever followed in thy journeys by Brahma<br>and the other gods. By them that call upon thee for the relief of their<br>burdens, and by them also that bow to thee at daybreak on Earth, there is<br>nothing that cannot be attained in respect either of offspring or wealth.<br>And because thou rescuest people from difficulties whether when they are<br>afflicted in the wilderness or sinking in the great ocean, it is for this<br>that thou art called Durga[10] by all. Thou art the sole refuge of men<br>when attacked by robbers or while afflicted in crossing streams and seas<br>or in wilderness and; forests. Those men that remember thee are never<br>prostrated, O great Goddess. Thou art Fame, thou art Prosperity, thou art<br>Steadiness, thou art Success; thou art the Wife, thou art men's<br>Offspring, thou art Knowledge, and thou art the Intellect. Thou art the<br>two Twilights, the Night Sleep, Light&#8212;both solar and lunar, Beauty,<br>Forgiveness, Mercy, and every other thing. Thou dispellest, worshipped by<br>the devotees their fetters, ignorance, loss of children and loss of<br>wealth, disease, death, and fear. I, who have been deprived of my<br>kingdom, seek thy protection. And as I bow to thee with bended head, O<br>Supreme Goddess, grant me protection, O thou of eyes like lotus leaves.<br>And be thou as boon-giving Truth unto us that are acting according to<br>Truth. And, O Durga, kind as thou art unto all that seek thy protection,<br>and affectionate unto all thy devotees, grant me protection!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Thus praised by the son of Pandu, the Goddess<br>showed herself unto him. And approaching the king, she addressed him in<br>these words, 'O mighty armed king, listen, O Lord, to these words of<br>mine. Having vanquished and slain the ranks of the Kauravas through my<br>grace, victory in battle will soon be thine. Thou shalt again lord it<br>over the entire Earth, having made thy dominions destitute of thorns.<br>And, O king, thou shalt also, with thy brothers, obtain great happiness.<br>And through my grace, joy and health will be thine. And they also in the<br>world who will recite my attributes and achievements will be freed from<br>their sins, and gratified. I will bestow upon them kingdom, long life,<br>beauty of person, and offspring. And they, O king, who will invoke me,<br>after thy manner, in exile or in the city, in the midst of battle or of<br>dangers from foes, in forests or in inaccessible deserts, in seas or<br>mountain fastnesses, there is nothing that they will not obtain in this<br>world. And ye sons of Pandu, he will achieve success in every business of<br>his that will listen to, or himself recite with devotion, this excellent<br>hymn. And through my grace neither the Kuru's spies, nor those that dwell<br>in the country of the Matsyas, will succeed in recognising you all as<br>long as ye reside in Virata's city!' And having said these words unto<br>Yudhishthira, that chastiser of foes, and having arranged for the<br>protection of the sons of Pandu, the Goddess disappeared there and then."
