                            "Vaisampayana said, 'After the son of Radha had fled from the field,<br>other warriors headed by Duryodhana, one after another, fell upon the son<br>of Pandu with their respective divisions. And like the shore withstanding<br>the fury of the surging sea, that warrior withstood the rage of that<br>countless host rushing towards him, arrayed in order of battle and<br>showering clouds of arrows. And that foremost of car-warriors, Kunti's<br>son Vibhatsu of white steeds, rushed towards the foe, discharging<br>celestial weapons all the while. Partha soon covered all the points of<br>the horizon with countless arrows shot from the Gandiva, like the sun<br>covering the whole earth with his rays. And amongst those that fought on<br>cars and horses and elephants, and amongst the mail-clad foot-soldiers,<br>there was none that had on his body a space of even two finger's breadth<br>unwounded with sharp arrows. And for his dexterity in applying celestial<br>weapons, and for the training of the steeds and the skill of Uttara, and<br>for the coursing of his weapons, and his prowess and light-handedness,<br>people began to regard Arjuna as the fire that blazeth forth during the<br>time of the universal dissolution for consuming all created things. And<br>none amongst the foe could cast his eyes on Arjuna who shone like a<br>blazing fire of great effulgence. And mangled by the arrows of Arjuna,<br>the hostile ranks looked like newly-risen clouds on the breast of a hill<br>reflecting the solar rays, or like groves of Asoka trees resplendent with<br>clusters of flowers. Indeed, afflicted by the arrows of Partha, the<br>soldiers looked like these, or like a beautiful garland whose flowers<br>gradually wither and drop away: And the all-pervading wind bore on its<br>wings in the sky the torn flags and umbrellas of the hostile host. And<br>affrighted at the havoc amongst their own ranks, the steeds fled in all<br>directions, freed from their yokes by means of Partha's arrows and<br>dragging after them broken portions of cars and elephants, struck on<br>their ears and ribs and tusks and nether lips and other delicate parts of<br>the body, began to drop down on the battle-field. And the earth, bestrewn<br>in a short time with the corpses of elephants belonging to the Kauravas,<br>looked like the sky overcast with masses of black clouds. And as that<br>fire of blazing flames at the end of the yuga consumeth all perishable<br>things of the world, both mobile and immobile, so did Partha, O king,<br>consumeth all foes in battle. And by the energy of his weapons and the<br>twang of his bow, and the preter-natural yells of the creatures stationed<br>on his flagstaff, and the terrible roar of the monkey, and by the blast<br>of his conch, that mighty grinder of foes, Vibhatsu, struck terror into<br>the hearts of all the troops of Duryodhana. And the strength of every<br>hostile warrior seemed, as it were, to be levelled to the dust at the<br>very sight of Arjuna. And unwilling to commit the daring act of sin of<br>slaying them that were defenceless, Arjuna suddenly fell back and<br>attacked the army from behind by means of clouds of keen-edged arrows<br>proceeding towards their aims like hawks let off by fowlers. And he soon<br>covered the entire welkin with clusters of blood-drinking arrows. And as<br>the (infinite) rays of the powerful sun, entering a small vessel, are<br>contracted within it for want of space, so the countless shafts of Arjuna<br>could not find space for their expansion even within the vast welkin.<br>Foes were able to behold Arjuna's car, when near, only once, for<br>immediately after, they were with their horses, sent to the other world.<br>And as his arrows unobstructed by the bodies of foes always passed<br>through them, so his car, unimpeded by hostile ranks, always passed<br>through the latter. And, indeed, he began to toss about and agitate the<br>hostile troops with great violence like the thousand-headed Vasuki<br>sporting in the great ocean. And as Kiritin incessantly shot his shafts,<br>the noise of the bow-string, transcending every sound, was so loud that<br>the like of it had never been heard before by created beings. And the<br>elephants crowding the field, their bodies pierced with (blazing) arrows<br>with small intervals between looked like black clouds coruscated with<br>solar rays. And ranging in all directions and shooting (arrows) right and<br>left, Arjuna's bow was always to be seen drawn to a perfect circle. And<br>the arrows of the wielder of the Gandiva never fell upon anything except<br>the aim, even as the eye never dwelleth on anything that is not<br>beautiful. And as the track of a herd of elephants marching through the<br>forest is made of itself, so was the track was made of itself for the car<br>of Kiritin. And struck and mangled by Partha, the hostile warriors<br>thought that,&#8212;Verily, Indra himself, desirous of Partha's victory,<br>accompanied by all the immortals is slaying us! And they also regarded<br>Vijaya, who was making a terrible slaughter around, to be none else than<br>Death himself who having assumed the form of Arjuna, was slaying all<br>creatures. And the troops of the Kurus, struck by Partha, were so mangled<br>and shattered that the scene looked like the achievement of Partha<br>himself and could be compared with nothing else save what was observable<br>in Partha's combats. And he severed the heads of foes, even as reapers<br>cut off the tops of deciduous herbs. And the Kurus all lost their energy<br>owing to the terror begot of Arjuna. And tossed and mangled by the<br>Arjuna-gale, the forest of Arjuna's foes reddened the earth with purple<br>secretions. And the dust mixed with blood, uplifted by the wind, made the<br>very rays of the sun redder still. And soon the sun-decked sky became so<br>red that it looked very much like the evening. Indeed, the sun ceaseth to<br>shed his rays as soon as he sets, but the son of Pandu ceased not to<br>shoot his shafts. And that hero of inconceivable energy overwhelmed, by<br>means of all celestial weapons, all the great bowmen of the enemy,<br>although they were possessed of great prowess. And Arjuna then shot three<br>and seventy arrows of sharp points at Drona, and ten at Dussaha and eight<br>at Drona's son, and twelve at Dussasana, and three at Kripa, the son of<br>Saradwat. And that slayer of foes pierced Bhishma, the son of Santanu,<br>with arrows, and king Duryodhana with a hundred. And, lastly, he pierced<br>Karna in the ear with a bearded shaft. And when that great bowmen Karna,<br>skilled in all weapons, was thus pierced, and his horses and car and<br>car-driver were all destroyed, the troops that supported him began to<br>break. And beholding those soldiers break and give way the son of Virata<br>desirous of knowing Partha's purpose, addressed him on the field of<br>battle, and said, 'O Partha, standing on this beautiful car, with myself<br>as charioteer, towards which division shall I go? For, commanded by thee,<br>I would soon take thee thither.'<br><br>"Arjuna replied, 'O Uttara, yonder auspicious warrior whom thou seest<br>cased in coat of tiger-skin and stationed on his car furnished with a<br>blue-flag and drawn by red steeds, is Kripa. There is to be seen the van<br>of Kripa's division. Take me thither. I shall show that great bowman my<br>swift-handedness in archery. And that warrior whose flag beareth the<br>device of an elegant water-pot worked in gold, is the preceptor<br>Drona&#8212;that foremost of all wielders of weapons. He is always an object<br>of regard with me, as also with all bearers of arms. Do thou, therefore,<br>circumambulate that great hero cheerfully. Let us bend our heads there,<br>for that is the eternal virtue. If Drona strikes my body first, then I<br>shall strike him, for then he will not be able to resent it. There, close<br>to Drona, that warrior whose flag beareth the device of a bow, is the<br>preceptor's son, the great car-warrior Aswatthaman, who is always an<br>object of regard with me as also with every bearer of arms. Do thou,<br>therefore, stop again and again, while thou comest by his car. There,<br>that warrior who stayeth on his car, cased in golden mail and surrounded<br>by a third part of the army consisting of the most efficient troops, and<br>whose flag beareth the device of an elephant in a ground of gold, is the<br>illustrious king Duryodhana, the son of Dhritarashtra. O hero, take<br>before him this thy car that is capable of grinding hostile cars. This<br>king is difficult of being vanquished in battle and is capable of<br>grinding all foes. He is regarded as the first of all Drona's disciples<br>in lightness of hand. I shall, in battle, show him my superior swiftness<br>in archery. There, that warrior whose flag beareth the device of a stout<br>chord for binding elephants, is Karna, the son of Vikartana, already<br>known to thee. When thou comest before that wicked son of Radha, be thou<br>very careful, for he always challengeth me to an encounter. And that<br>warrior whose flag is blue and beareth the device of five stars with a<br>sun (in the centre), and who endued with great energy stayeth on his car<br>holding a huge bow in hand and wearing excellent fences, and over whose<br>head is an umbrella of pure white, who standeth at the head of a<br>multitudinous array of cars with various flags and banners like the sun<br>in advance of masses of black clouds, and whose mail of gold looks bright<br>as the sun or the moon, and who with his helmet of gold striketh terror<br>into my heart, is Bhishma, the son of Santanu and the grandsire of us<br>all. Entertained with regal splendour by Duryodhana, he is very partial<br>and well-affected towards that prince. Let him be approached last of all,<br>for he may, even now, be an obstacle to me. While fighting with me, do<br>thou carefully guide the steeds. Thus addressed by him, Virata's son, O<br>king, guided Savyasachin's car with great alacrity towards the spot where<br>Kripa stood anxious to fight.'"
