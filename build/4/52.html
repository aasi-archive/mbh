                            "Bhishma said, 'The wheel of time revolves with its divisions, viz., with<br>Kalas and Kasthas and Muhurtas and days and fortnights and months and<br>constellations and planets and seasons and years. In consequence of their<br>fractional excesses and the deviations of also of the heavenly bodies,<br>there is an increase of two months in every five years. It seems to me<br>that calculating this wise, there would be an excess of five months and<br>twelve nights in thirteen years. Everything, therefore, that the sons of<br>Pandu had promised, hath been exactly fulfilled by them. Knowing this to<br>be certain, Vibhatsu hath made his appearance. All of them are<br>high-souled and fully conversant with the meanings of the scriptures. How<br>would they deviate from virtue that have Yudhishthira for their guide?<br>The sons of Kunti do not yield to temptation. They have achieved a<br>difficult feat. If they had coveted the possession of their kingdom by<br>unfair means, then those descendants of the Kuru race would have sought<br>to display their prowess at the time of the match at dice. Bound in bonds<br>of virtue, they did not deviate from the duties of the Kshatriya order.<br>He that will regard them to have behaved falsely will surely meet with<br>defeat. The sons of Pritha would prefer death to falsehood. When the<br>time, however, comes, those bulls among men&#8212;the Pandava's&#8212;endued with<br>energy like that of Sikra, would not give up what is theirs even if it is<br>defended by the wielder himself of the thunderbolt. We shall have to<br>oppose in battle the foremost of all wielders of weapons. Therefore, let<br>such advantageous arrangements as have the sanction of the good and the<br>honest be now made without loss of time so that our possessions may not<br>be appropriated by the foe. O king of kings, O Kaurava, I have never seen<br>a battle in which one of the parties could say,&#8212;we are sure to win. When<br>a battle occurs, there must be victory or defeat, prosperity or<br>adversity. Without doubt, a party to a battle must have either of the<br>two. Therefore, O king of kings, whether a battle be now proper or not<br>consistent with virtue or not, make thy arrangements soon, for Dhananjaya<br>is at hand.'<br><br>"Duryodhana said, 'I will not, O grandsire, give back the Pandavas their<br>kingdom. Let every preparation, therefore, for battle be made without<br>delay.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen to what I regard as proper, if it pleases thee. I<br>should always say what is for thy good, O Kaurava. Proceed thou towards<br>the capital, without loss of time, taking with thee a fourth part of the<br>army. And let another fourth march, escorting the kine. With half the<br>troops we will fight the Pandava. Myself and Drona, and Karna and<br>Aswatthaman and Kripa will resolutely withstand Vibhatsu, or the king of<br>the Matsyas, or Indra himself, if he approaches. Indeed, we will<br>withstand any of these like the bank withstanding the surging sea.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'These words spoken by the high-souled Bhishma<br>were acceptable to them, and the king of the Kauravas acted accordingly<br>without delay. And having sent away the king and then the kine, Bhishma<br>began to array the soldiers in order of battle. And addressing the<br>preceptor, he said, 'O preceptor, stand thou in the centre, and let<br>Aswatthaman stand on the left, and let the wise Kripa, son of Saradwata,<br>defend the right wing, and let Karna of the Suta caste, clad in mail,<br>stand in the van. I will stand in the rear of the whole army, protecting<br>it from that point.'"
