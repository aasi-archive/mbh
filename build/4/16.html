                            "Kichaka said, 'O thou of tresses ending in beautiful curls, thou art<br>welcome. Surely, the night that is gone hath brought me an auspicious<br>day, for I have got thee today as the mistress of my house. Do what is<br>agreeable to me. Let golden chains, and conchs and bright ear-rings made<br>of gold, manufactured in various countries, and beautiful rubies and<br>gems, and silken robes and deer-skins, be brought for thee. I have also<br>an excellent bed prepared for thee. Come, sitting upon it do thou drink<br>with me the wine prepared from the honey flower.' Hearing these words,<br>Draupadi said, 'I have been sent to thee by the princess for taking away<br>wine. Do thou speedily bring me wine, for she told me that she is<br>exceedingly thirsty.' And this, Kichaka said, 'O gentle lady, others will<br>carry what the princess wants.' And saying this, the Suta's son caught<br>hold of Draupadi's right arm. And at this, Draupadi exclaimed, 'As I have<br>never, from intoxication of the senses, been unfaithful to my husbands<br>even at heart, by that Truth, O wretch, I shall behold thee dragged and<br>lying powerless on the ground.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Seeing that large-eyed lady reproving him in<br>that strain, Kichaka suddenly seized her by the end of her upper garment<br>as she attempted to run away. And seized with violence by Kichaka, the<br>beautiful princess, unable to tolerate it, and with frame trembling with<br>wrath, and breathing quickly, dashed him to the ground. And dashed to the<br>ground thus, the sinful wretch tumbled down like a tree whose roots had<br>been cut. And having thrown Kichaka down on the ground when the latter<br>had seized her, she, trembling all over rushed to the court, where king<br>Yudhishthira was, for protection. And while she was running with all her<br>speed, Kichaka (who followed her), seizing her by the hair, and bringing<br>her down on the ground, kicked her in the very presence of the king.<br>Thereupon, O Bharata, the Rakshasa that had been appointed by Surya to<br>protect Draupadi, gave Kichaka a shove with a force mighty as that of the<br>wind. And overpowered by the force of Rakshasa, Kichaka reeled and fell<br>down senseless on the ground, even like an uprooted tree. And both<br>Yudhishthira and Bhimasena who were seated there, beheld with wrathful<br>eyes that outrage on Krishna by Kichaka. And desirous of compassing the<br>destruction of the wicked Kichaka, the illustrious Bhima gnashed his<br>teeth in rage. And his forehead was covered with sweat, and terrible<br>wrinkles appeared thereon. And a smoky exhalation shot forth from his<br>eyes, and his eye-lashes stood on end. And that slayer of hostile heroes<br>pressed his forehead with his hands. And impelled by rage, he was on the<br>point of starting up with speed. Thereat king Yudhishthira, apprehensive<br>of discovery, squeezed his thumbs and commanded Bhima to forbear. And<br>Bhima who then looked like an infuriate elephant eyeing a large tree, was<br>thus forbidden by his elder brother. And the latter said, 'Lookest thou,<br>O cook, for trees for fuel. If thou art in need of faggots, then go out<br>and fell trees.' And the weeping Draupadi of fair hips, approaching the<br>entrance of the court, and seeing her melancholy lords, desirous yet of<br>keeping up the disguise duty-bound by their pledge, with eyes burning in<br>fire, spoke these words unto the king of the Matsyas, 'Alas, the son of a<br>Suta hath kicked today the proud and beloved wife of those whose foe can<br>never sleep in peace even if four kingdoms intervene between him and<br>them. Alas, the son of a Suta hath kicked today the proud and beloved<br>wife of those truthful personages, who are devoted to Brahmanas and who<br>always give away without asking any thing in gift. Alas! the son of a<br>Suta hath kicked today the proud and beloved wife of those, the sounds of<br>whose kettle-drums and the twangs of whose bow-strings are ceaselessly<br>heard. Alas, the son of a Suta hath kicked today the proud and beloved<br>wife of those who are possessed of abundant energy and might, and who are<br>liberal in gifts and proud of their dignity. Alas, the son of a Suta hath<br>kicked today the proud and beloved wife of those who, if they had not<br>been fettered by the ties of duty, could destroy this entire world.<br>Where, alas, are those mighty warriors today who, though living in<br>disguise, have always granted protection unto those that solicit it? Oh,<br>why do those heroes today, endued as they are with strength and possessed<br>of immeasurable energy, quietly suffer, like eunuchs, their dear and<br>chaste wife to be thus insulted by a Suta's son? Oh, where is that wrath<br>of theirs, that prowess, and that energy, when they quietly bear their<br>wife to be thus insulted by a wicked wretch? What can I (a weak woman) do<br>when Virata, deficient in virtue, coolly suffereth my innocent self to be<br>thus wronged by a wretch? Thou dost not, O king, act like a king towards<br>this Kichaka. Thy behaviour is like that of a robber, and doth not shine<br>in a court. That I should thus be insulted in thy very presence, O<br>Matsya, is highly improper. Oh, let all the courtiers here look at this<br>violence of Kichaka. Kichaka is ignorant of duty and morality, and Matsya<br>also is equally so. These courtiers also that wait upon such a king are<br>destitute of virtue.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'With these and other words of the same kind the<br>beautiful Krishna with tearful eyes rebuked the king of the Matsyas. And<br>hearing her, Virata said, 'I do not know what your dispute has been out<br>of our sight. Not knowing the true cause how can I show my<br>discrimination?' Then the courtiers, having learnt every thing, applauded<br>Krishna, and they all exclaimed, 'Well done!' 'Well done!' and censured<br>Kichaka. And the courtiers said, 'That person who owneth this large-eyed<br>lady having every limb of hers endued with beauty for his wife,<br>possesseth what is of exceeding value and hath no occasion to indulge in<br>any grief. Surely, such a damsel of transcendent beauty and limbs<br>perfectly faultless is rare among men. Indeed, it seems to us that she is<br>a goddess.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'And while the courtiers, having beheld Krishna<br>(under such circumstances), were applauding her thus, Yudhishthira's<br>forehead, from ire, became covered with sweat. And that bull of the Kuru<br>race then addressed that princess, his beloved spouse, saying, 'Stay not<br>here, O Sairindhri; but retire to the apartments of Sudeshna. The wives<br>of heroes bear affliction for the sake of their husbands, and undergoing<br>toil in ministering unto their lords, they at last attain to region where<br>their husbands may go. Thy Gandharva husbands, effulgent as the sun, do<br>not, I imagine, consider this as an occasion for manifesting their wrath,<br>inasmuch as they do not rush to thy aid. O Sairindhri, thou art ignorant<br>of the timeliness of things, and it is for this that thou weepest as an<br>actress, besides interrupting the play of dice in Matsya's court. Retire,<br>O Sairindhri; the Gandharvas will do what is agreeable to thee. And they<br>will surely display thy woe and take the life of him that hath wronged<br>thee.' Hearing these words the Sairindhri replied, 'They of whom I am the<br>wedded wife are, I ween, extremely kind. And as the eldest of them all is<br>addicted to dice, they are liable to be oppressed by all.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'And having said this, the fair-hipped Krishna<br>with dishevelled hair and eyes red in anger, ran towards the apartments<br>of Sudhesna. And in consequence of having wept long her face looked<br>beautiful like the lunar disc in the firmament, emerged from the clouds.<br>And beholding her in that condition, Sudeshna asked, 'Who, O beauteous<br>lady, hath insulted thee? Why, O amiable damsel, dost thou weep? Who,<br>gentle one, hath done thee wrong? Whence is this thy grief?' Thus<br>addressed, Draupadi said, 'As I went to bring wine for thee, Kichaka<br>struck me in the court in the very presence of the king, as if in the<br>midst of a solitary wood.' Hearing this, Sudeshna said, 'O thou of<br>tresses ending in beautiful curls, as Kichaka, maddened by lust hath<br>insulted thee that art incapable of being possessed by him, I shall cause<br>him to be slain if thou wishest it.' Thereupon Draupadi answered, 'Even<br>others will slay him,&#8212;even they whom he hath wronged, I think it is<br>clear that he will have to go to the abode of Yama this very day!'"
