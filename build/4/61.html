                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Having defeated Vikartana's son, Arjuna said unto<br>the son of Virata, 'Take me towards that division where yonder device of<br>a golden palmyra is seen. There our grandfather, Santanu's son, like unto<br>a celestial, waiteth, desirous of an encounter with me.' Thereupon,<br>beholding that mighty host thronged with cars and horses and elephants,<br>Uttara, sorely pierced with arrows, said, 'O hero, I am no longer able to<br>guide thy excellent steeds. My spirits droop and my mind is exceedingly<br>bewildered. All the directions seem to be whirling before my eyes in<br>consequence of the energy of the celestial weapons used by thee and the<br>Kurus. I have been deprived of my senses by the stench of fat and blood<br>and flesh. Beholding all this, from terror my mind is, as it were, cleft<br>in twain. Never before had I beheld such a muster of horses in battle.<br>And at the flapping of fences, and the blare of conchs, the leonine roars<br>made by the warriors and the shrieks of elephants, and the twang of the<br>Gandiva resembling the thunder, I have, O hero, been so stupefied that I<br>have been deprived of both hearing and memory. And, O hero, beholding<br>thee incessantly drawing to a circle, in course of the conflict, the<br>Gandiva which resembleth a circle of fire, my sight faileth me and my<br>heart is rent asunder. And seeing thy fierce form in battle, like that of<br>the wielder of the Pinaka while inflamed with wrath, and looking also at<br>the terrible arrows shot by thee, I am filled with fear. I fail to see<br>when thou takest up thy excellent arrows, when thou fixest them on the<br>bow-string, and when thou lettest them off. And though all this is done<br>before my eyes, yet, deprived of my senses, I do not see it. My spirits<br>are drooping and earth itself seems to be swimming before me. I have no<br>strength to hold the whip and the reins.' Hearing these words, Arjuna<br>said, 'Do thou not fear. Assure thyself. Thou also hast, on the field of<br>battle performed, O bull among men, wonderful feats. Blessed be thou,<br>thou art a prince and born in the illustrious line of Matsyas. It<br>behoveth thee not to feel dispirited in chastising thy foes. Therefore, O<br>prince, stationed on my car, muster all thy fortitude and hold the reins<br>of my steeds, O slayer of foes, when I once more become engaged in<br>battle.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said this unto Virata's son, that best<br>of men and foremost of car-warriors, the mighty-armed Arjuna, again<br>addressed the son of Virata, saying. 'Take me without delay to the van of<br>Bhishma's division. I will cut off his very bow-string in the battle.<br>Thou shalt behold today the celestial weapons of blazing beauty, shot by<br>me, look like flashes of lightning disporting amid the clouds in the sky.<br>The Kauravas shall behold the gold decked back of my Gandiva today, and<br>assembled together the foe shall dispute, saying,&#8212;By which hand of his,<br>the right or the left, doth he should? And I shall cause a dreadful river<br>(of death) to flow today towards the other world with blood for its<br>waters and cars for its eddies, and elephants for its crocodiles. I shall<br>today, with my straight arrows, extirpate the Kuru forest having hands<br>and feet and heads and backs and arms for the branches of its trees.<br>Alone, bow in hand, vanquishing the Kuru host, a hundred paths shall open<br>before me like those of a forest in conflagration. Struck by me thou<br>shalt today behold the Kuru army moving round and round like a wheel<br>(unable to fly off the field). I shall show thee today my excellent<br>training in arrows and weapons. Stay thou on my car firmly, whether the<br>ground be smooth or uneven. I can pierce with my winged arrows even the<br>mountain of Sumeru that stands touching the very heavens. I slew of old,<br>at Indra's command, hundreds and thousands of Paulomas and Kalakhanjas in<br>battle. I have obtained my firmness of grasp from Indra, and my lightness<br>of hand from Brahman, and I have learnt various modes of fierce attack<br>and defence amid crowds of foes from Prajapati. I vanquished, on the<br>other side of the great ocean, sixty thousands of car-warriors&#8212;all<br>fierce archers&#8212;residing in Hiranyapura. Behold, now I defeat the<br>multitudinous host of the Kurus like a tempest scattering a heap of<br>cotton. With my fiery arrows I shall today set the Kuru-forest to fire,<br>having banners for its trees, the foot-soldiers for its shrubs, and the<br>car-warriors for its beasts of prey. Like unto the wielder of the<br>thunderbolt overthrowing the Danavas, alone I shall, with my straight<br>arrows, bring down from the chambers of their cars the mighty warrior of<br>the Kuru army stationed therein and struggling in the conflict to the<br>best of their power. I have obtained from Rudra the Raudra, from Varuna<br>the Varuna from Agni the Agneya, from the god of Wind the Vayava, and<br>from Sakra the thunderbolt and other weapons. I shall certainly<br>exterminate the fierce Dhartarashtra-forest though protected by many<br>leonine warriors. Therefore, O Virata's son, let thy fears be dispelled.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus assured by Savyasachin, the son of Virata<br>penetrated into that fierce array of cars protected by Bhishma. The son<br>of Ganga, however, of fierce deeds, cheerfully withstood the mighty-armed<br>hero advancing from desire of vanquishing the heroes in battle. Jishnu,<br>then, confronting Bhishma, cut off his standard clean off at the roots by<br>shooting a gold-decked arrow pierced by which it fell to the ground. And<br>at this, four mighty warriors, Dussasana and Vikarna and Dussaha and<br>Vivingsati, skilled in weapons and endued with great energy, and all<br>decked with handsome garlands and ornaments, rushed towards that terrible<br>bowman. And advancing towards Vibhatsu&#8212;that fierce archer, these all<br>encompassed him around. Then the heroic Dussasana pierced the son of<br>Virata with a crescent-shaped arrow and he pierced Arjuna with another<br>arrow in the breast. And Jishnu, confronting Dussasana, cut off by means<br>of a sharp-edged arrow furnished with vulturine wings his adversary's bow<br>plaited with gold, and then pierced his person in the breast by means of<br>five arrows. And afflicted by the arrows of Partha. Dussasana fled,<br>leaving the combat. Then Vikarna, the son of Dhritarashtra, pierced<br>Arjuna&#8212;that slayer of hostile heroes, by means of sharp and straight<br>arrows furnished with vulturine wings. But the son of Kunti within a<br>moment hit him also in the forehead with straight shafts. And pierced by<br>Arjuna, he fell down from his car. And at this, Dussaha, supported by<br>Vivingsati, covered Arjuna with a cloud of sharp arrows, impelled by the<br>desire of rescuing his brother. Dhananjaya, however, without the least<br>anxiety, pierced both of them almost at the same instant by means of<br>couple of keen-edged arrows and then slew the steeds of both. And there<br>upon, both those sons of Dhritarashtra, deprived of their steeds and<br>their bodies mangled were taken away by the warrior behind them who had<br>rushed forward with other cars. Then the unvanquished Vibhatsu, the<br>mighty son of Kunti, decked with diadem and sure of aim, simultaneously<br>attacked all sides with his arrows.'"
