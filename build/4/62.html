                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Then, O thou of the Bharata race, all the great<br>car-warriors of the Kurus, united together, began to assail Arjuna to the<br>best of their might from all sides. But that hero of immeasurable soul<br>completely covered all those mighty car-warriors with clouds of arrows,<br>even as the mist covereth the mountains. And the roars of huge elephants<br>and conchs, mingling together, produced a loud up roar. And penetrating<br>through the bodies of elephants and horses as also through steel coats of<br>mail, the arrows shot by Partha fell by thousands. And shooting shafts<br>with the utmost celerity, the son of Pandu seemed in that contest to<br>resemble the blazing sun of an autumnal midday. And afflicted with fear,<br>the car-warriors began to leap down from their cars and the<br>horse-soldiers from horse-back, while the foot-soldiers began to fly in<br>all directions. And loud was the clatter made by Arjuna's shafts as they<br>cleft the coats of mail belonging to mighty warriors, made of steel,<br>silver, and copper. And the field was soon covered with the corpses of<br>warriors mounted on elephants and horses, all mangled by the shafts of<br>Partha of great impetuosity like unto sighing snakes. And then it seemed<br>as if Dhananjaya, bow in hand, was dancing on the field of battle. And<br>sorely affrighted at the twang of the Gandiva resembling the noise of the<br>thunder, many were the combatants that fled from that terrible conflict.<br>And the field of battle was bestrewn with severed heads decked with<br>turbans, ear-rings and necklaces of gold, and the earth looked beautiful<br>by being scattered all over with human trunks mangled by shafts, and arms<br>having bows in their grasp and hands decked with ornaments. And, O bull<br>of the Bharata race, in consequence of heads cut off by whetted shafts<br>ceaselessly falling on the ground, it seemed as if a shower of stones<br>fell from the sky. And that Partha of formidable prowess, displaying his<br>fierceness, now ranged the field of battle, pouring the terrible fire of<br>his wrath upon the sons of Dhritarashtra. And beholding the fierce<br>prowess of Arjuna who thus scorched the hostile host, the Kuru warriors,<br>in the very presence of Duryodhana, became dispirited and ceased to<br>fight. And, O Bharata, having struck terror into that host and routed<br>those mighty car-warriors, that fore-most of victors, ranged on the<br>field. And the son of Pandu then created on the field of battle a<br>dreadful river of blood, with waving billows, like unto the river of<br>death that is created by Time at the end of the Yuga, having the<br>dishevelled hair of the dead and the dying for its floating moss and<br>straw, with bows and arrows for its boats, fierce in the extreme and<br>having flesh and animal juices for its mire. And coats of mail and<br>turbans floated thick on its surface. And elephants constituted its<br>alligators and the cars its rafts. And marrow and fat and blood<br>constituted its currents. And it was calculated to strike terror into the<br>hearts of the spectators. And dreadful to behold, and fearful in the<br>extreme, and resounding with the yells of ferocious beasts, keen edged<br>weapons constituted its crocodiles. And Rakshasas and other cannibals<br>haunted it from one end to the other. And strings of pearls constituted<br>its ripples, and various excellent ornaments, its bubbles. And having<br>swarms of arrows for its fierce eddies and steeds for its tortoises, it<br>was incapable of being crossed. And the mighty car warrior constituted<br>its large island, and it resounded with the bleat of conchs and the sound<br>of drums. And the river of blood that Partha created was incapable of<br>being crossed. Indeed, so swift-handed was Arjuna that the spectators<br>could not perceive any interval between his taking up an arrow, and<br>fixing it on the bow-string, and letting it off by a stretch of the<br>Gandiva.'"
