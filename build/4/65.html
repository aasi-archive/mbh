                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Thus summoned to battle by the illustrious hero,<br>Dhritarashtra's son turned back stung by those censures, like an<br>infuriate and mighty elephant pricked by a hook. And stung by those<br>reproaches and unable to bear them, that mighty and brave car-warrior<br>endued with great swiftness, turned back on his car, like a snake that is<br>trampled under foot. And beholding Duryodhana turn back with his wounds,<br>Karna, that hero among men, decked with a golden necklace, stopped the<br>king on the way and soothing him, himself proceeded along the north of<br>Duryodhana's car to meet Partha in battle. And the mighty-armed Bhishma<br>also, the son of Santanu, turning back his steeds decked with gold,<br>enormous in size, and of tawny hue, rushed bow in hand, for protecting<br>Duryodhana from Partha's hand. And Drona and Kripa and Vivingsati and<br>Dussasana and others also, quickly turning back, rushed forward with<br>speed with drawn bows and arrows fixed on the bow-strings, for protecting<br>Duryodhana. And beholding those divisions advance towards him like the<br>swelling surges of the ocean, Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, quickly<br>rushed at them like a crane rushing at a descending cloud. And with<br>celestial weapons in their hands, they completely surrounded the son of<br>Pritha and rained on him from all sides a perfect shower of shafts, like<br>clouds showering on the mountain breast a heavy downpour of rain, And<br>warding off with weapons, all the weapons of those bulls among the Kurus,<br>the wielder of the Gandiva who was capable of enduring all foes, evolved<br>another irresistible weapon obtained from Indra, called Sanmohana. And<br>entirely covering the cardinal and other directions with sharp and<br>keen-edged arrows furnished with beautiful feathers, that mighty hero<br>stupefied their senses with the twang of the Gandiva. And once more,<br>taking up with both his hands that large conch of loud blare, Partha,<br>that slayer of foes, blew it with force and filled the cardinal and other<br>points, the whole earth, and sky, with that noise. And those foremost of<br>the Kuru heroes were all deprived of their senses by the sound of that<br>conch blown by Partha. And all of them stood still, their bows, from<br>which they were never separated, dropping down from their hands. And when<br>the Kuru army became insensible, Partha calling to mind the words of<br>Uttara, addressed the son of the Matsya king, saying, 'O best of men, go<br>thou among the Kurus, so long as they remain insensible, and bring away<br>the white garments of Drona and Kripa, and the yellow and handsome ones<br>of Karna, as also the blue ones of the king and Drona's son. Methinks,<br>Bhishma is not stupefied, for he knoweth how to counteract this weapon of<br>mine. So, pass thou on, keeping his steeds to thy left; for those that<br>are sensible should thus be avoided,' Hearing these words, the<br>illustrious son of Matsya, giving up the reins of the steeds, jumped down<br>from the car and taking off the garments of the warriors, came back to<br>his place. And the son of Virata then urged the four handsome steeds with<br>flanks adorned with golden armours. And those white steeds, urged on,<br>took Arjuna away from the midst of battle-field and beyond the array of<br>the infantry bearing standards in their hands. And, Bhishma, beholding<br>that best of men thus going away, struck him with arrows. And Partha,<br>too, having slain Bhishma's steeds, pierced him with ten shafts. And<br>abandoning Bhishma on the field of battle, having first slain his<br>car-driver, Arjuna with a good-looking bow in hand came out of that<br>multitude of cars, like the sun emerging from the clouds. And<br>Dhritarashtra's son, that foremost of heroes among the Kurus, recovering<br>his senses, saw the son of Pritha standing like the lord of the<br>celestials, alone on the battle-field. And he said in hurry (unto<br>Bhishma), 'How hath this one escape from thee? Do thou afflict him in<br>such a way that he may not escape.' And at this, Santanu's son, smiling,<br>said unto him, 'Where had been this sense of thine, and where had been<br>thy prowess too, when thou hadst been in a state of unconsciousness<br>renouncing thy arrows and handsome bow? Vibhatsu is not addicted to the<br>commission of atrocious deeds; nor is his soul inclined to sin. He<br>renounceth not his principles even for the sake of the three worlds. It<br>is for this only that all of us have not been slain in this battle. O<br>thou foremost of Kuru heroes, go back to the city of the Kurus, and let<br>Partha also go away, having conquered the kine. Do thou never foolishly<br>throw away thy own good. Indeed, that which leadeth to one's welfare<br>ought to be accomplished.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having listened to the words of the grandsire<br>that tended to his own welfare, the wrathful king Duryodhana no longer<br>eager for battle, drew a deep sigh and became silent. And reflecting that<br>the advice of Bhishma was beneficial and seeing that the Pandavas gaining<br>in strength, the other warriors also, desirous of protecting Duryodhana,<br>resolved to return. And beholding those foremost of Kuru heroes departing<br>for their city, Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, with a cheerful heart<br>followed them for a while, desirous of addressing and worshipping them.<br>And having worshipped the aged grandsire&#8212;the son of Santanu, as also the<br>preceptor Drona, and having saluted with beautiful arrows Drona's son and<br>Kripa and other venerable ones among the Kurus, the son of Pritha broke<br>into fragments Duryodhana's crown decked with precious gems, with another<br>arrow. And having saluted all the venerable and brave warriors thus, he<br>filled the three worlds with the twang of the Gandiva. And suddenly<br>blowing his conch called Devadatta, the hero pierced the hearts of all<br>his foes. And having humbled the hostile, he looked resplendent on his<br>car decked with a handsome flag. And beholding the Kurus depart, Kiritin<br>cheerfully said unto Matsya's son, 'Turn back thy steeds; thy kine have<br>been recovered; the foe is going away and do thou also return to thy city<br>with a cheerful heart.' And the celestials also, having witnessed that<br>most wonderful encounter between Falguna and the Kurus, were highly<br>delighted, and went to their respective abodes, reflecting upon Partha's<br>feats.'"
