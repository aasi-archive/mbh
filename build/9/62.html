                            Sanjaya said, "All those kings, possessed of arms that resembled spiked<br>bludgeons, then proceeded towards their tents, filled with joy and<br>blowing their conchs on their way. The Pandavas also, O monarch,<br>proceeded towards our encampment. The great bowman Yuyutsu followed them,<br>as also Satyaki, and Dhrishtadyumna, and Shikhandi, and the five sons of<br>Draupadi. The other great bowmen also proceeded towards our tents. The<br>Parthas then entered the tent of Duryodhana, shorn of its splendours and<br>reft of its lord and looking like an arena of amusement after it has been<br>deserted by spectators. Indeed, that pavilion looked like a city reft of<br>festivities, or a lake without its elephant. It then swarmed with women<br>and eunuchs and certain aged counsellors. Duryodhana and other heroes,<br>attired in robes dyed in yellow, formerly used, O king, to wait<br>reverentially, with joined hands, on those old counsellors.<br><br>Arrived at the pavilion of the Kuru king, the Pandavas, those foremost of<br>car-warriors, O monarch, dismounted from their cars. At that time, always<br>engaged, O bull of Bharata's race, in the good of his friend, Keshava,<br>addressed the wielder of gandiva, saying, "Take down thy gandiva as also<br>the two inexhaustible quivers. I shall dismount after thee, O best of the<br>Bharatas! Get thee down, for this is for thy good, O sinless one!"<br><br>Pandu's brave son Dhananjaya did as he was directed. The intelligent<br>Krishna, abandoning the reins of the steeds, then dismounted from the car<br>of Dhananjaya. After the high-souled Lord of all creatures had dismounted<br>from that car, the celestial Ape that topped the mantle of Arjuna's<br>vehicle, disappeared there and then. The top of the vehicle, which had<br>before been burnt by Drona and Karna with their celestial weapons,<br>quickly blazed forth to ashes, O king, without any visible fire having<br>been in sight. Indeed, the car of Dhananjaya, with its quick pairs of<br>steeds, yoke, and shaft, fell down, reduced to ashes.<br><br>Beholding the vehicle thus reduced to ashes, O lord, the sons of Pandu<br>became filled with wonder, and Arjuna, O king, having saluted Krishna and<br>bowed unto him, said these words, with joined hands and in an<br>affectionate voice, 'O Govinda, O divine one, for what reason hath this<br>car been consumed by fire? What is this highly wonderful incident that<br>has happened before our eyes! O thou of mighty arms, if thou thinkest<br>that I can listen to it without harm, then tell me everything.'<br><br>Vasudeva said, 'That car, O Arjuna, had before been consumed by diverse<br>kinds of weapons. It was because I had sat upon it during battle that it<br>did not fall into pieces, O scorcher of foes! Previously consumed by the<br>energy of brahmastra, it has been reduced to ashes upon my abandoning it<br>after attainment by thee of thy objects!'<br><br>Then, with a little pride, that slayer of foes, the divine Keshava,<br>embracing king Yudhishthira, said unto him, 'By good luck, thou hast won<br>the victory, O son of Kunti! By good luck, thy foes have been vanquished!<br>By good luck, the wielder of gandiva, Bhimasena the son of Pandu,<br>thyself, O king, and the two sons of Madri have escaped with life from<br>this battle so destructive of heroes, and have escaped after having slain<br>all your foes! Quickly do that, O Bharata, which should now be done by<br>thee!<br><br>After I had arrived at Upaplavya, thyself, approaching me, with the<br>wielder of gandiva in thy company, gavest me honey and the customary<br>ingredients, and saidst these words, O Lord: 'This Dhananjaya, O Krishna,<br>is thy brother and friend! He should, therefore, be protected by thee in<br>all dangers!' After thou didst say these words, I answered thee, saying,<br>'So be it!'<br><br>That Savyasaci hath been protected by me. Victory also hath been thine, O<br>king! With his brothers, O king of kings, that hero of true prowess hath<br>come out of this dreadful battle, so destructive of heroes, with life!'<br>Thus addressed by Krishna, King Yudhishthira the just, with hair standing<br>on end, O monarch, said these words unto Janardana:<br><br>Yudhishthira said, "Who else save thee, O grinder of foes, not excepting<br>the thunder-wielding Purandara himself, could have withstood the<br>brahmastras hurled by Drona and Karna! It was through thy grace that the<br>samsaptakas were vanquished! It was through thy grace that Partha had<br>never to turn back from even the fiercest of encounters! Similarly, it<br>was through thy grace, O mighty-armed one, that I myself, with my<br>posterity, have, by accomplishing diverse acts one after another,<br>obtained the auspicious end of prowess and energy! At Upaplavya, the<br>great rishi Krishna-Dvaipayana told me that thither is Krishna where<br>righteousness is, and thither is victory where Krishna is!'"<br><br>Sanjaya continued, "After this conversation, those heroes entered thy<br>encampment and obtained the military chest, many jewels, and much wealth.<br>And they also obtained silver and gold and gems and pearls and many<br>costly ornaments and blankets and skins, and innumerable slaves male and<br>female, and many other things necessary for sovereignty. Having obtained<br>that inexhaustible wealth belonging to thee, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>those highly blessed ones, whose foe had been slain, uttered loud cries<br>of exultation. Having unyoked their animals, the Pandavas and Satyaki<br>remained there awhile for resting themselves.<br><br>Then Vasudeva of great renown said, 'We should, as an initiatory act of<br>blessedness, remain out of the camp for this night.' Answering, 'So be<br>it!' the Pandavas and Satyaki, accompanied by Vasudeva, went out of the<br>camp for the sake of doing that which was regarded as an auspicious act.<br>Arrived on the banks of the sacred stream Oghavati, O king, the Pandavas,<br>reft of foes, took up their quarters there for that night!<br><br>They despatched Keshava of Yadu's race to Hastinapura. Vasudeva of great<br>prowess, causing Daruka to get upon his car, proceeded very quickly to<br>that place where the royal son of Ambika was. While about to start on his<br>car having Shaibya and Sugriva (and the others) yoked unto it, (the<br>Pandavas) said unto him, 'Comfort the helpless Gandhari who hath lost all<br>her sons!' Thus addressed by the Pandavas, that chief of the Satvatas<br>then proceeded towards Hastinapura and arrived at the presence of<br>Gandhari who had lost all her sons in the war.'"
