                            "Sanjaya said, 'After the (Kuru) army had been rallied, Shalva, the ruler<br>of the Mlecchas, filled with rage, rushed against the large force of the<br>Pandavas, riding on a gigantic elephant, with secretions issuing from the<br>usual limbs, looking like a hill, swelling with pride, resembling<br>Airavata himself, and capable of crushing large bands of foes. Shalva's<br>animal sprung from a high and noble breed. It was always worshipped by<br>Dhritarashtra's son. It was properly equipped and properly trained for<br>battle, O king, by persons well-conversant with elephant-lore. Riding on<br>that elephant, that foremost of kings looked like the morning sun at the<br>close of summer. Mounting on that foremost of elephants, O monarch, he<br>proceeded against the Pandavas and began to pierce them on all sides with<br>keen and terrible shafts that resembled Indra's thunder in force. While<br>he shot his arrows in that battle and despatched hostile warriors to<br>Yama's abode, neither the Kauravas nor the Pandavas could notice any<br>lapses in him, even as the Daityas, O king, could not notice any in<br>Vasava, the wielder of the thunder, in days of yore, while the latter was<br>employed in crushing their divisions. The Pandavas, the Somakas, and the<br>Srinjayas, beheld that elephant looking like a 1,000 elephants careering<br>around them, even as the foes of the gods had in days of yore beheld the<br>elephant of Indra in battle. Agitated (by that animal), the hostile army<br>looked on every side as if deprived of life. Unable to stand in battle,<br>they then fled away in great fear, crushing one another as they ran. Then<br>the vast host of the Pandavas, broken by king Salwa, suddenly fled on all<br>sides, unable to endure the impetuosity of that elephant. Beholding the<br>Pandava host broken and flying away in speed, all the foremost of<br>warriors of thy army worshipped king Salwa and blew their conchs white as<br>the moon. Hearing the shouts of the Kauravas uttered in joy and the blare<br>of their conchs, the commander of the Pandava and the Srinjaya forces,<br>the Pancala prince (Dhrishtadyumna) could not, from wrath, endure it. The<br>illustrious Dhrishtadyumna then, with great speed, proceeded for<br>vanquishing the elephant, even as the Asura Jambha had proceeded against<br>Airavata, the prince of elephants that Indra rode in the course of his<br>encounter with Indra. Beholding the ruler of the Pandavas impetuously<br>rushing against him, Salwa, that lion among kings, quickly urged his<br>elephants, O king, for the destruction of Drupada's son. The latter,<br>seeing the animal approaching with precipitancy, pierced it with three<br>foremost of shafts, polished by the hands of the smith, keen, blazing,<br>endued with fierce energy, and resembling fire itself in splendour and<br>force. Then that illustrious hero struck the animal at the frontal globes<br>with five other whetted and foremost of shafts. Pierced therewith, that<br>prince of elephants, turning away from the battle, ran with great speed.<br>Salwa, however, suddenly checking that foremost of elephants which had<br>been exceedingly mangled and forced to retreat, caused it to turn back,<br>and with hooks and keen lances urged it forward against the car of the<br>Pancala king, pointing it out to the infuriate animal. Beholding the<br>animal rushing impetuously at him, the heroic Dhrishtadyumna, taking up a<br>mace, quickly jumped down on the Earth from his car, his limbs stupefied<br>with fear. That gigantic elephant, meanwhile, suddenly crushing that<br>gold-decked car with its steeds and driver, raised it up in the air with<br>his trunk and then dashed it down on the Earth. Beholding the driver of<br>the Pancala king thus crushed by that foremost of elephants, Bhima and<br>Shikhandi and the grandson of Sini rushed with great speed against that<br>animal. With their shafts they speedily checked the impetuosity of the<br>advancing beast. Thus received by those car-warriors and checked by them<br>in battle, the elephant began to waver. Meanwhile, king Salwa began to<br>shoot his shafts like the sun shedding his rays on all sides. Struck with<br>those shafts, the (Pandava) car-warriors began to fly away. Beholding<br>that feat of Salwa, the Pancalas, the Srinjayas, and the Matsyas, O king,<br>uttered loud cries of "Oh!" and "Alas!" in that battle, all those<br>foremost of men, however, encompassed the animal on all sides. The brave<br>Pancala king then, taking up his mace which resembled the lofty crest of<br>a mountain, appeared there. Fearlessly, O king, that hero, that smiter of<br>foes, rushed with speed against the elephant. Endued with great activity,<br>the prince of the Pancalas approached and began to strike with his mace<br>that animal which was huge as a hill and which shed its secretions like a<br>mighty mass of pouring clouds. Its frontal globes suddenly split open,<br>and it uttered a loud cry; and vomiting a profuse quantity of blood, the<br>animal, huge as a hill, suddenly fell down, even as a mountain falling<br>down during an earthquake. While that prince of elephants was falling<br>down, and while the troops of thy son were uttering wails of woe at the<br>sight, that foremost of warriors among the Sinis cut off the head of king<br>Salwa with a sharp and broad-headed arrow. His head having been cut off<br>by the Satwata hero, Salwa fell down on the Earth along with his prince<br>of elephants, even like a mountain summit suddenly riven by the<br>thunderbolt hurled by the chief of the celestials.'"
