                            "Sanjaya said, 'When king Yudhishthira the just was thus afflicted by the<br>ruler of Madras, Satyaki and Bhimasena and the two sons of Madri by<br>Pandu, encompassing Shalya with their cars, began to afflict him in that<br>battle. Beholding the unsupported Shalya thus afflicted by those great<br>car-warriors (and seeing him successfully repel those attacks), loud<br>sounds of applause were heard, and the Siddhas (who witnessed the<br>encounter) became filled with delight. The ascetics, assembled together<br>(for witnessing the battle), declared it to be wonderful. Then Bhimasena<br>in that encounter, having pierced Shalya who had become (as his name<br>implied) an irresistible dart in prowess, with one arrow, next pierced<br>him with seven. Satyaki, desirous of rescuing the son of Dharma, pierced<br>Shalya with a hundred arrows and uttered a loud leonine roar. Nakula<br>pierced him with five arrows, and Sahadeva with seven; the latter then<br>once more pierced him with as many. The heroic ruler of the Madras,<br>struggling carefully in that battle, thus afflicted by those mighty<br>car-warriors, drew a formidable bow capable of bearing a great strain and<br>of imparting great force to the shafts sped from it, and pierced Satyaki,<br>O sire, with five and twenty shafts and Bhima with three and seventy and<br>Nakula with seven. Then cutting off with a broad-headed arrow the bow,<br>with shaft fixed on the string of Sahadeva, he pierced Sahadeva himself,<br>in that battle, with three and seventy shafts. Sahadeva then, stringing<br>another bow, pierced his maternal uncle of great splendour with five<br>shafts that resembled snakes of virulent poison or blazing fire. Filled<br>with great rage, he then struck his adversary's driver with a straight<br>shaft in that battle and then Shalya himself once more with three. Then<br>Bhimasena pierced the ruler of the Madras with seventy arrows, and<br>Satyaki pierced him with nine, and king Yudhishthira with sixty. Thus<br>pierced, O monarch, by those mighty car-warriors, blood began to flow<br>from Shalya's body, like crimson streams, running down the breast of a<br>mountain of red chalk. Shalya, however, quickly pierced in return each of<br>those great bowmen with five arrows, O king, which feat seemed<br>exceedingly wonderful. With another broad-headed arrow, that mighty<br>car-warrior then, O sire, cut off the stringed bow of Dharma's son in<br>that encounter. Taking up another bow, that great car-warrior, the son of<br>Dharma, covered Shalya, his steeds, and driver, and standard, and car,<br>with many arrows. Thus shrouded in that battle by the son of Dharma with<br>his shafts, Shalya struck the former with ten keen arrows. Then Satyaki,<br>filled with rage upon beholding the son of Dharma thus afflicted with<br>shafts, checked the heroic ruler of the Madras with clouds of arrows. At<br>this, Shalya cut off with a razor-faced arrow the formidable bow of<br>Satyaki, and pierced each of the other Pandava warriors with three<br>arrows. Filled with rage, O monarch, Satyaki of unbaffled prowess then<br>hurled at Shalya a lance equipped with a golden staff and decked with<br>many jewels and gems. Bhimasena sped at him a cloth-yard shaft that<br>looked like a blazing snake; Nakula hurled at him a dart, Sahadeva an<br>excellent mace, and the son of Dharma a Sataghni impelled by the desire<br>of despatching him. The ruler of the Madras, however, quickly baffled in<br>that battle all those weapons, hurled from the arms of those five<br>warriors at him, as these coursed towards his car. With a number of<br>broad-headed arrows Shalya cut off the lance hurled by Satyaki. Possessed<br>of valour and great lightness of hand, he cut off into two fragments the<br>gold-decked shaft sped at him by Bhima. He then resisted with clouds of<br>shafts the terrible dart, equipped with a golden handle, that Nakula had<br>sped at him and the mace also that Sahadeva had thrown. With a couple of<br>other arrows, O Bharata, he cut off the Sataghni sped at him by the king,<br>in the very sight of the sons of Pandu, and uttered a loud leonine roar.<br>The grandson of Sini, however, could not endure the defeat of his weapon<br>in that battle. Insensate with rage, Satyaki took up another bow and<br>pierced the ruler of the Madras with two shafts and his driver with<br>three. At this, Shalya, O monarch, excited with rage, deeply pierced all<br>of them with ten arrows, like persons piercing mighty elephants with<br>sharp-pointed lances. Thus checked in that battle by the ruler of the<br>Madras, O Bharata, those slayers of foes became unable to stay in front<br>of Shalya. King Duryodhana, beholding the prowess of Shalya, regarded the<br>Pandavas, the Pancalas, and the Srinjayas as already slain. Then, O king,<br>the mighty-armed Bhimasena, possessed of great prowess and mentally<br>resolved to cast off his life-breaths, encountered the ruler of the<br>Madras. Nakula and Sahadeva and Satyaki of great might, encompassing<br>Shalya, shot their arrows at him from every side. Though encompassed by<br>those four great bowmen and mighty car-warriors among the Pandavas, the<br>valiant ruler of the Madras still fought with them. Then, O king, the<br>royal son of Dharma, in that dreadful battle, quickly cut off with a<br>razor-headed arrow one of the protectors of Shalya's car-wheels. When<br>that brave and mighty car-warrior, that protector of Shalya's car-wheel,<br>was thus slain, Shalya of great strength covered the Pandava troops with<br>showers of arrows. Beholding his troops shrouded with arrows, O monarch,<br>in that battle, king Yudhishthira the just began to reflect in this<br>strain, "Verily, how shall those grave words of Madhava become true? I<br>hope, the rider of the Madras, excited with rage, will not annihilate my<br>army in battle.' Then the Pandavas, O elder brother of Pandu<br>(Dhritarashtra), with cars and elephants and steeds, approached the ruler<br>of the Madras and began to afflict him from every side. Like the wind<br>dispersing mighty masses of clouds, the king of the Madras, in that<br>battle, dispersed that risen shower of arrows and diverse other kinds of<br>weapons in profusion. We then beheld the downpour of gold-winged arrows<br>shot by Shalya coursing through the welkin like a flight of locusts.<br>Indeed, those arrows shot by the ruler of the Madras from the van of<br>battle were seen to fall like swarms of birds. With the gold-decked<br>shafts that issued from the bow of the Madra king, the welkin, O monarch,<br>became so filled that there was not an inch of empty space. When a thick<br>gloom appeared, caused by the arrows shot by the mighty ruler of the<br>Madras owing to his extreme lightness of hands in that dreadful battle,<br>and when they beheld the vast host of the Pandavas thus agitated by that<br>hero, the gods and the Gandharvas became filled with great wonder.<br>Afflicting with vigour all the Pandava warriors with his shafts from<br>every side, O sire, Shalya shrouded king Yudhishthira the just and roared<br>repeatedly like a lion. The mighty car-warriors of the Pandavas, thus<br>shrouded by Shalya in that battle, became unable to proceed against that<br>great hero for fighting with him. Those, however, amongst the Pandavas,<br>that had Bhimasena at their head and that were led by king Yudhishthira<br>the just, did not fly away from that ornament of battle, the brave<br>Shalya.'"
