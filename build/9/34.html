                            "Sanjaya said, 'When that fierce battle, O monarch, was about to<br>commence, and when all the high-souled Pandavas had taken their seats,<br>indeed, having heard that battle between those two heroes, both of whom<br>were his disciples, was about to begin, Rama, whose banner bore the<br>device of the palmyra palm, and who owns the plough for his weapon, came<br>to that spot. Beholding him, the Pandavas, with Keshava, filled with joy<br>advanced towards him, and receiving him, worshipped him with due rites.<br>Their worship over, they then, O king, said unto him these words,<br>"Witness, O Rama, the skill, in battle, of thy two disciples!" Rama then<br>casting his eyes on Krishna and the Pandavas, and looking at Duryodhana<br>also of Kuru's race who was standing there armed with mace, said, "Two<br>and forty days have passed since I left home. I had set out under the<br>constellation Pushya and have come back under Sravana. I am desirous, O<br>Madhava, of beholding this encounter with the mace between these two<br>disciples of mine!" At that time the two heroes, Duryodhana and<br>Vrikodara, looked resplendent as they stood on the field, both armed with<br>maces. King Yudhishthira, embracing him owning the plough for his weapon,<br>duly enquired about his welfare and bade him welcome. Those two great<br>bowmen, the two illustrious Krishnas, filled with joy, cheerfully saluted<br>the hero having the plough for his weapon and embraced him. Similarly,<br>the two sons of Madri and the five sons of Draupadi saluted Rohini's son<br>of great strength and stood (at a respectful distance). Bhimasena of<br>great strength and thy son, O monarch, both with uplifted maces (in their<br>arms), worshipped Valadeva. The other kings honoured him by bidding him<br>welcome, and then all of them said unto Rama, "Witness this encounter, O<br>thou of mighty arms!" Even thus those mighty car-warriors said unto the<br>high-souled son of Rohini. Endued with immeasurable energy, Rama, having<br>embraced the Pandavas and the Srinjayas, enquired after the welfare of<br>all the (other) kings. Similarly, all of them, approaching, enquired<br>after his welfare. The hero of the plough, having in return saluted all<br>the high-souled Kshatriyas, and having made courteous enquiries about<br>each according to their years, affectionately embraced Janardana and<br>Satyaki. Smelling their heads, he enquired after their welfare. Those<br>two, in return, O king, duly worshipped him, their superior, joyfully,<br>like Indra and Upendra worshipping Brahman, the lord of the celestials.<br>Then Dharma's son, O Bharata, said these words unto that chastiser of<br>foes, the son of Rohini, "Behold, O Rama, this formidable encounter<br>between the two brothers!" Thus worshipped by those great car-warriors,<br>the elder brother of Keshava, of mighty arms and great beauty, took his<br>seat amongst them. Clad in blue robes and possessed of a fair complexion,<br>Rama, as he sat amidst those kings, looked resplendent like the moon in<br>the firmament, encompassed by multitudes of stars. Then that dreadful<br>encounter, making the very hair stand on end, took place between those<br>two sons of thine, O king, for terminating the quarrel (that had raged<br>for many years).'"
