                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding that fight thus raging between those two<br>foremost heroes of Kuru's race, Arjuna said unto Vasudeva, "Between these<br>two, who, in thy opinion, is superior? Who amongst them hath what merit?<br>Tell me this, O Janardana."<br><br>"'Vasudeva said, "The instruction received by them hath been equal.<br>Bhima, however, is possessed of greater might, while the son of<br>Dhritarashtra is possessed of greater skill and hath laboured more. If he<br>were to fight fairly, Bhimasena will never succeed in winning the<br>victory. If, however, he fights unfairly he will be surely able to slay<br>Duryodhana. The Asuras were vanquished by the gods with the aid of<br>deception. We have heard this. Virochana was vanquished by Shakra with<br>the aid of deception. The slayer of Vala deprived Vritra of his energy by<br>an act of deception. Therefore, let Bhimasena put forth his prowess,<br>aided by deception! At the time of the gambling, O Dhananjaya, Bhima<br>vowed to break the thighs of Suyodhana with his mace in battle. Let this<br>crusher of foes, therefore, accomplish that vow of his. Let him with<br>deception, slay the Kuru king who is full of deception. If Bhima,<br>depending upon his might alone, were to fight fairly, king Yudhishthira<br>will have to incur great danger. I tell thee again, O son of Pandu,<br>listen to me. It is through the fault of king Yudhishthira alone that<br>danger hath once more overtaken us! Having achieved great feats by the<br>slaughter of Bhishma and the other Kurus, the king had won victory and<br>fame and had almost attained the end of the hostilities. Having thus<br>obtained the victory, he placed himself once more in a situation of doubt<br>and peril. This has been an act of great folly on the part of<br>Yudhishthira, O Pandava, since he hath made the result of the battle<br>depend upon the victory or the defeat of only one warrior! Suyodhana is<br>accomplished, he is a hero; he is again firmly resolved. This old verse<br>uttered by Usanas hath been heard by us. Listen to me as I recite it to<br>thee with its true sense and meaning! 'Those amongst the remnant of a<br>hostile force broken flying away for life, that rally and come back to<br>the fight, should always be feared, for they are firmly resolved and have<br>but one purpose! Shakra himself, O Dhananjaya, cannot stand before them<br>that rush in fury, having abandoned all hope of life. This Suyodhana had<br>broken and fled. All his troops had been killed. He had entered the<br>depths of a lake. He had been defeated and, therefore, he had desired to<br>retire into the woods, having become hopeless of retaining his kingdom.<br>What man is there, possessed of any wisdom, that would challenge such a<br>person to a single combat? I do not know whether Duryodhana may not<br>succeed in snatching the kingdom that had already become ours! For full<br>thirteen years he practised with the mace with great resolution. Even<br>now, for slaying Bhimasena, he jumpeth up and leapeth transversely! If<br>the mighty-armed Bhima does not slay him unfairly, the son of<br>Dhritarashtra will surely remain king!" Having heard those words of the<br>high-souled Keshava, Dhananjaya struck his own left thigh before the eyes<br>of Bhimasena. Understanding that sign, Bhima began to career with his<br>uplifted mace, making many a beautiful circle and many a Yomaka and other<br>kinds of manoeuvres. Sometimes adopting the right mandala, sometimes the<br>left mandala, and sometimes the motion called Gomutraka, the son of Pandu<br>began to career, O king, stupefying his foe. Similarly, thy son, O<br>monarch, who was well conversant with encounters with the mace, careered<br>beautifully and with great activity, for slaying Bhimasena. Whirling<br>their terrible maces which were smeared with sandal paste and other<br>perfumed unguents, the two heroes, desirous of reaching the end of their<br>hostilities, careered in that battle like two angry Yamas. Desirous of<br>slaying each other, those two foremost of men, possessed of great<br>heroism, fought like two Garudas desirous of catching the same snake.<br>While the king and Bhima careered in beautiful circles, their maces<br>clashed, and sparks of fire were generated by those repeated clashes.<br>Those two heroic and mighty warriors struck each other equally in that<br>battle. They then resembled, O monarch, two oceans agitated by the<br>tempest. Striking each other equally like two infuriated elephants, their<br>clashing maces produced peals of thunder. During the progress of that<br>dreadful and fierce battle at close quarters, both those chastisers of<br>foes, while battling, became fatigued. Having rested for a while, those<br>two scorchers of foes, filled with rage and uplifting their maces, once<br>more began to battle with each other. When by the repeated descents of<br>their maces, O monarch, they mangled each other, the battle they fought<br>became exceedingly dreadful and perfectly unrestrained. Rushing at each<br>other in that encounter, those two heroes, possessed of eyes like those<br>of bulls and endued with great activity, struck each other fiercely like<br>two buffaloes in the mire. All their limbs mangled and bruised, and<br>covered with blood from head to foot, they looked like a couple of<br>Kinsukas on the breast of Himavat. During the progress of the encounter,<br>when, Vrikodara (as a ruse) seemed to give Duryodhana an opportunity, the<br>latter, smiling a little, advanced forward. Well-skilled in battle, the<br>mighty Vrikodara, beholding his adversary come up, suddenly hurled his<br>mace at him. Seeing the mace hurled at him, thy son, O monarch, moved<br>away from that spot at which the weapon fell down baffled on the earth.<br>Having warded off that blow, thy son, that foremost one of Kuru's race,<br>quickly struck Bhimasena with his weapon. In consequence of the large<br>quantity of blood drawn by that blow, as also owing to the violence<br>itself of the blow, Bhimasena of immeasurable energy seemed to be<br>stupefied. Duryodhana, however, knew not that the son of Pandu was so<br>afflicted at that moment. Though deeply afflicted, Bhima sustained<br>himself, summoning all his patience. Duryodhana, therefore, regarded him<br>to be unmoved and ready to return the blow. It was for this that thy son<br>did not then strike him again. Having rested for a little while, the<br>valiant Bhimasena rushed furiously, O king, at Duryodhana who was<br>standing near. Beholding Bhimasena of immeasurable energy filled with<br>rage and rushing towards him, thy high-souled son, O bull of Bharata's<br>race, desiring to baffle his blow, set his heart on the manoeuvre called<br>Avasthana. He, therefore, desired to jump upwards, O monarch, for<br>beguiling Vrikodara. Bhimasena fully understood the intentions of his<br>adversary. Rushing, therefore, at him, with a loud leonine roar, he<br>fiercely hurled his mace at the thighs of the Kuru king as the latter had<br>jumped up for baffling the first aim. That mace, endued with the force of<br>the thunder and hurled by Bhima of terrible feats, fractured the two<br>handsome thighs of Duryodhana. That tiger among men, thy son, after his<br>thighs had been broken by Bhimasena, fell down, causing the earth to echo<br>with his fall. Fierce winds began to blow, with loud sounds at repeated<br>intervals. Showers of dust fell. The earth, with her trees and plants and<br>mountains, began to tremble. Upon the fall of that hero who was the head<br>of all monarchs on earth, fierce and fiery winds blew with a loud noise<br>and with thunder falling frequently. Indeed, when that lord of earth<br>fell, large meteors were seen to flash down from the sky. Bloody showers,<br>as also showers of dust, fell, O Bharata! These were poured by Maghavat,<br>upon the fall of thy son! A loud noise was heard, O bull of Bharata's<br>race, in the welkin, made by the Yakshas, and the Rakshasas and the<br>Pisachas. At that terrible sound, animals and birds, numbering in<br>thousands, began to utter more frightful noise on every side. Those<br>steeds and elephants and human beings that formed the (unslain) remnant<br>of the (Pandava) host uttered loud cries when thy son fell. Loud also<br>became the blare of conchs and the peal of drums and cymbals. A terrific<br>noise seemed to come from within the bowels of the earth. Upon the fall<br>of thy son, O monarch, headless beings of frightful forms, possessed of<br>many legs and many arms, and inspiring all creatures with dread, began to<br>dance and cover the earth on all sides. Warriors, O king, that stood with<br>standards or weapons in their arms, began to tremble, O king, when thy<br>son fell. Lakes and wells, O best of kings, vomited forth blood. Rivers<br>of rapid currents flowed in opposite directions. Women seemed to look<br>like men, and men to look like women at that hour, O king, when thy son<br>Duryodhana fell! Beholding those wonderful portents, the Pancalas and the<br>Pandavas, O bull of Bharata's race, became filled with anxiety. The gods<br>and the Gandharvas went away to the regions they desired, talking, as<br>they proceeded, of that wonderful battle between thy sons. Similarly the<br>Siddhas, and the Charanas of the fleetest course, went to those places<br>from which they had come, applauding those two lions among men."
