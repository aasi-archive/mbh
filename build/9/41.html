                            Vaishampayana said, "The delighter of the Yadus then proceeded to the<br>asylum (of Vaka) which resounded with the chanting of the Vedas. There<br>the great ascetic, O king, named Dalvyavaka poured the kingdom of<br>Dhritarashtra, the son of Vichitravirya, as a libation (on the<br>sacrificial fire). By practising very austere penances he emaciated his<br>own body. Endued with great energy, the virtuous Rishi, filled with great<br>wrath, (did that act). In former times, the Rishis residing in the<br>Naimisha forest had performed a sacrifice extending for twelve years. In<br>course of that sacrifice, after a particular one called Viswajit had been<br>completed, the Rishis set out for the country of the Pancalas. Arrived<br>there, they solicited the king for giving them one and twenty strong and<br>healthy calves to be given away as Dakshina (in the sacrifice they have<br>completed). Dalvya Vaka, however, (calling those Rishis), said unto them,<br>'Do you divide those animals (of mine) among you! Giving away these (unto<br>you), I shall solicit a great king (for some).' Having said so unto all<br>those Rishis, Vaka of great energy, that best of Brahmanas, then<br>proceeded to the abode of Dhritarashtra. Arrived at the presence of king<br>Dhritarashtra, Dalvya begged some animals of him. That best of kings,<br>however, seeing that some of his kine died without any cause, angrily<br>said unto him. 'Wretch of a Brahmana, take, if thou likest, these animals<br>that (are dead)!' Hearing these words, the Rishi, conversant with duties,<br>thought, 'Alas, cruel are the words that have been addressed to me in the<br>assembly!' Having reflected in this strain, that best of Brahmanas,<br>filled with wrath, set his heart upon the destruction of king<br>Dhritarashtra. Cutting the flesh from off the dead animals, that best of<br>sages, having ignited a (sacrificial) fire on the tirtha of the<br>Sarasvati, poured those pieces as libations for the destruction of king<br>Dhritarashtra's kingdom. Observant of rigid vows, the great Dalvya Vaka,<br>O monarch, poured Dhritarashtra's kingdom as a libation on the fire, with<br>the aid of those pieces of meat. Upon the commencement of that fierce<br>sacrifice according to due rites, the kingdom of Dhritarashtra, O<br>monarch, began to waste away. Indeed, O lord, the kingdom of that monarch<br>began to waste away, even as a large forest begins to disappear when men<br>proceed to cut it down with the axe. Overtaken by calamities, the kingdom<br>began to lose its prosperity and life. Seeing his kingdom thus afflicted,<br>the puissant monarch, O king, became very cheerless and thoughtful.<br>Consulting with the Brahmanas, he began to make great endeavours for<br>freeing his territories (from affliction). No good, however, came of his<br>efforts, for the kingdom continued to waste away. The king became very<br>cheerless. The Brahmanas also, O sinless one, became filled with grief.<br>When at last the king failed to save his kingdom, he asked his<br>counsellors. O Janamejaya, (about the remedy). The counsellors reminded<br>him of the evil he had done in connection with the dead kine. And they<br>said, 'The sage Vaka is pouring thy kingdom as a libation on the fire<br>with the aid of the flesh (of those animals). Thence is this great waste<br>of thy kingdom! This is the consequence of ascetic rites. Thence is this<br>great calamity! Go, O king, and gratify that Rishi by the side of a<br>receptacle of water on the bank of the Sarasvati!' Repairing to the bank<br>of the Sarasvati, the king falling at his feet and touching them with his<br>head, joined his hands and said, O thou of Bharata's race, these words,<br>'I gratify thee, O adorable one, forgive my offence. I am a senseless<br>fool, a wretch inspired with avarice. Thou art my refuge, thou art my<br>protector, it behoveth thee to show me thy grace!' Beholding him thus<br>overwhelmed with grief and indulging in lamentations like these, Vaka<br>felt compassion for him and freed his kingdom. The Rishi became gratified<br>with him, having dismissed his angry feelings. For freeing his kingdom,<br>the sage again poured libations on the fire. Having freed the kingdom<br>(from calamities) and taken many animals in grief, he became pleased at<br>heart and once more proceeded to the Naimisha woods. The liberal-minded<br>king Dhritarashtra also, of righteous soul, with a cheerful heart,<br>returned to his own capital full of prosperity.<br><br>"In that tirtha, Brihaspati also, of great intelligence, for the<br>destruction of the Asuras and the prosperity of the denizens of heaven,<br>poured libations on the sacrificial fire, with the aid of flesh. Upon<br>this, the Asuras began to waste away and were destroyed by the gods,<br>inspired by desire of victory in battle. Having with due rites given unto<br>the Brahmanas steeds and elephants and vehicles with mules yoked unto<br>them and jewels of great value and much wealth, and much corn, the<br>illustrious and mighty-armed Rama then proceeded, O king, to the tirtha<br>called Yayata. There, O monarch, at the sacrifice of the high-souled<br>Yayati, the son of Nahusha, the Sarasvati produced milk and clarified<br>butter. That tiger among men, king Yayati, having performed a sacrifice<br>there, went cheerfully to heaven and obtained many regions of<br>blessedness. Once again, O lord, king Yayati performed a sacrifice there.<br>Beholding his great magnanimity of soul and his immutable devotion to<br>herself, the river Sarasvati gave unto the Brahamanas (invited to that<br>sacrifice) everything for which each of them cherished only a wish in his<br>heart. That foremost of rivers gave unto each where he was, amongst those<br>that were invited to the sacrifice, houses and beds and food of the six<br>different kinds of taste, and diverse other kinds of things. The<br>Brahmanas regarded those valuable gifts as made to them by the king.<br>Cheerfully they praised the monarch and bestowed their auspicious<br>blessings upon him. The gods and the Gandharvas were all pleased with the<br>profusion of articles in that sacrifice. As regards human beings, they<br>were filled with wonder at sight of that profusion. The illustrious<br>Baladeva, of soul subdued and restrained and cleansed, having the palmyra<br>on his banner, distinguished by great righteousness, and ever giving away<br>the most valuable things, then proceeded to that tirtha of fierce current<br>called Vasishthapavaha."
