                            "Sanjaya said, 'After the heroic Salwa, that ornament of assemblies, had<br>been slain, thy army speedily broke like a mighty tree broken by the<br>force of the tempest. Beholding the army broken, the mighty car-warrior<br>Kritavarma, possessed by heroism and great strength, resisted the hostile<br>force in that battle. Seeing the Satwata hero, O king, standing in battle<br>like a hill pierced with arrows (by the foes), the Kuru heroes, who had<br>fled away, rallied and came back. Then, O monarch, a battle took place<br>between the Pandavas and the returned Kurus who made death itself their<br>goal. Wonderful was that fierce encounter which occurred between the<br>Satwata hero and his foes, since he resisted the invincible army of the<br>Pandavas. When friends were seen to accomplish the most difficult feats,<br>friends, filled with delight, uttered leonine shouts that seemed to reach<br>the very heavens. At those sounds the Pancalas, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>became inspired with fear. Then Satyaki, the grandson of Sini, approached<br>that spot. Approaching king Kshemakirti of great strength, Satyaki<br>despatched him to Yama's abode, with seven keen shafts. Then the son of<br>Hridika, of great intelligence, rushed with speed against that bull of<br>Sini's race, that mighty armed warrior, as the latter came, shooting his<br>whetted shafts. Those two bowmen, those two foremost of car-warriors,<br>roared like lions and encountered each other with great force, both being<br>armed with foremost of weapons. The Pandavas, the Pancalas, and the other<br>warriors, became spectators of that terrible encounter between the two<br>heroes. Those two heroes of the Vrishni-Andhaka race, like two elephants<br>filled with delight, struck each other with long arrows and shafts<br>equipped with calf-toothed heads. Careering in diverse kinds of tracks,<br>the son of Hridika and that bull of Sini's race soon afflicted each other<br>with showers of arrows. The shafts sped with great force from the bows of<br>the two Vrishni lions were seen by us in the welkin to resemble flights<br>of swiftly coursing insects. Then the son of Hridika, approaching Satyaki<br>of true prowess, pierced the four steeds of the latter with four keen<br>shafts. The long-armed Satyaki, enraged at this, like an elephant struck<br>with a lance, pierced Kritavarma with eight foremost of arrows. Then<br>Kritavarma pierced Satyaki with three arrows whetted on stone and sped<br>from his bow drawn to its fullest and then cut off his bow with another<br>arrow. Laying aside his broken bow, that bull of Sini's race quickly took<br>up another with arrow fixed on it. Having taken up that foremost of bows<br>and stringed it, that foremost of all bowmen, that Atiratha of mighty<br>energy and great intelligence and great strength, unable to endure the<br>cutting of his bow by Kritavarma, and filled with fury, quickly rushed<br>against the latter. With ten keen shafts that bull of Sini's race then<br>struck the driver, the steeds, and the standard of Kritavarma. At this, O<br>king, the great bowman and mighty car-warrior Kritavarma, beholding his<br>gold-decked car made driverless and steedless, became filled with rage.<br>Uplifting a pointed lance, O sire, he hurled it with all the force of his<br>arm at that bull of Sini's race, desirous of slaying him. Satyaki,<br>however, of the Satwata race, striking that lance with many keen arrows,<br>cut it off into fragments and caused it to fall down, stupefying<br>Kritavarma of Madhu's race (with his activity and prowess). With another<br>broad-headed arrow he then struck Kritavarma in the chest. Made steedless<br>and driverless in that battle by Yuyudhana, skilled in weapons,<br>Kritavarma came down on the Earth. The heroic Kritavarma having been<br>deprived of his car by Satyaki in that single combat, all the (Kaurava)<br>troops became filled with great fear. A great sorrow afflicted the heart<br>of thy sons, when Kritavarma was thus made steedless and driverless and<br>carless. Beholding that chastiser of foes made steedless and driverless,<br>Kripa, O king, rushed at that bull of Sini's race, desirous of<br>despatching him to Yama's abode. Taking Kritavarma upon his car in the<br>very sight of all the bowmen, the mighty-armed Kripa bore him away from<br>the press of battle. After Kritavarma had been made carless and the<br>grandson of Sini had become powerful on the field, the whole army of<br>Duryodhana once more turned away from the fight. The enemy, however, did<br>not see it, for the (Kuru) army was then shrouded with a dusty cloud. All<br>thy warriors fled, O monarch, except king Duryodhana. The latter,<br>beholding from a near point that his own army was routed, quickly<br>rushing, assailed the victorious enemy, alone resisting them all.<br>Fearlessly that invincible warrior, filled with rage, assailed with keen<br>arrows all the Pandus, and Dhrishtadyumna the son of Prishta, and<br>Shikhandi, and the sons of Draupadi, and the large bands of the Pancalas,<br>and the Kaikeyas, O sire, and the Somakas! With firm determination thy<br>mighty son stood in battle, even as a blazing and mighty fire on the<br>sacrificial platform, sanctified with mantras. Even thus, king Duryodhana<br>careered all over the field, in that battle. His foes could not approach<br>him then, like living creatures unable to approach the Destroyer. Then<br>the son of Hridika came there, riding on another car.'"
