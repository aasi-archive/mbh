                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the army broken, the valiant king of the<br>Madras, addressed his driver, saying, "Quickly urge these steeds endued<br>with the fleetness of thought. Yonder stays king Yudhishthira, the son of<br>Pandu, looking resplendent with the umbrella held over his head. Take me<br>thither with speed, O driver, and witness my might. The Parthas are<br>unable to stand before me in battle." Thus addressed, the driver of the<br>Madra king proceeded to that spot where stood king Yudhishthira the just<br>of true aim. Shalya fell suddenly upon the mighty host of the Pandavas.<br>Alone, he checked it like the continent checking the surging sea. Indeed,<br>the large force of the Pandavas, coming against Shalya, O sire, stood<br>still in that battle, like the rushing sea upon encountering a mountain.<br>Beholding the ruler of the Madras standing for battle on the field, the<br>Kauravas returned, making death their goal. After they had returned, O<br>king, and separately taken up their positions in well-formed array, an<br>awful battle set in, in which blood flowed freely like water.<br><br>"'The invincible Nakula encountered Chitrasena. These two heroes, both of<br>whom were excellent bowmen, approaching, drenched each other with showers<br>of arrows in that battle, like two pouring clouds risen in the welkin on<br>the south and the north. I could not mark any difference between the son<br>of Pandu and his antagonist. Both of them were accomplished in weapons,<br>both endued with might, and both conversant with the practices of<br>car-warriors. Each bent upon slaying the other, they carefully looked for<br>each other's lapses. Then Chitrasena, O monarch, with a broad-headed<br>shaft, well-tempered and sharp, cut off Nakula's bow at the handle.<br>Fearlessly then the son of Karna struck the bowless Nakula at the<br>forehead with three shafts equipped with wings of gold and whetted on<br>stone. With a few other keen arrows he then despatched Nakula's steeds to<br>Yama's abode. Next, he felled both the standard and the driver of his<br>antagonist, each with three arrows. With those three arrows sped from the<br>arms of his foe sticking to his fore-head, Nakula, O king, looked<br>beautiful like a mountain with three crests. Deprived of his bow and his<br>cars, the brave Nakula, taking up a sword, jumped down from his vehicle<br>like a lion from a mountain-summit. As, however, he rushed on foot, his<br>antagonist poured a shower of arrows upon him. Possessed of active<br>prowess, Nakula received that arrowy shower on his shield. Getting at the<br>car then of Chitrasena, the mighty-armed hero, the son of Pandu,<br>conversant with all modes of warfare and incapable of being tired with<br>exertion, ascended it in the very sight of all the troops. The son of<br>Pandu then cut off from Chitrasena's trunk his diadem-decked head adorned<br>with ear-rings, and graced with a beautiful nose and a pair of large<br>eyes. At this, Chitrasena, endued with the splendour of the sun, fell<br>down on the terrace of his car. Beholding Chitrasena slain, all the great<br>car-warriors there uttered loud cries of praise and many leonine roars.<br>Meanwhile, the two sons of Karna, Sushena and Satyasena, both of whom<br>were great car-warriors, beholding their brother slain, shot showers of<br>keen shafts. Those foremost of car-warriors rushed with speed against the<br>son of Pandu like a couple of tigers, O king, in the deep forest rushing<br>against an elephant from desire of slaying him. Both of them poured their<br>keen shafts upon the mighty car-warrior Nakula. Indeed, as they poured<br>those shafts, they resembled two masses of clouds pouring rain in<br>torrents. Though pierced with arrows all over, the valiant and heroic son<br>of Pandu cheerfully took up another bow after ascending on another car,<br>and stood in battle like the Destroyer himself in rage. Then those two<br>brothers, O monarch, with their straight shafts, cut off Nakula's car<br>into fragments. Then Nakula, laughing, smote the four steeds of Satyasena<br>with four whetted and keen shafts in that encounter. Aiming a long shaft<br>equipped with wings of gold, the son of Pandu then cut off, O monarch,<br>the bow of Satyasena. At this, the latter, mounting on another car and<br>taking up another bow, as also his brother Sushena, rushed against the<br>son of Pandu. The valiant son of Madri fearlessly pierced each of them, O<br>monarch, with couple of shafts at the van of battle. Then the mighty<br>car-warrior Sushena, filled with wrath, cut off in that battle, laughing<br>the while, the formidable bow of Pandu's son with a razor-headed arrow.<br>Then Nakula, insensate with rage, took up another bow and pierced Sushena<br>with five arrows and struck his standard with one. Without losing a<br>moment, he then cut off the bow and the leathern fence of Satyasena also,<br>O sire, at which all the troops there uttered a loud shout. Satyasena,<br>taking up another foe-slaying bow that was capable of bearing a great<br>strain, shrouded the son of Pandu with arrows from every side. Baffling<br>those arrows, Nakula, that slayer of hostile heroes, pierced each of his<br>antagonists with a couple of shafts. Each of the latter separately<br>pierced the son of Pandu in return with many straight-coursing shaft.<br>Next they pierced Nakula's driver also with many keen shafts. The valiant<br>Satyasena then, endued with great lightness of hand, cut off without his<br>brother's help the shafts of Nakula's car and his bow with a couple of<br>arrows. The Atiratha Nakula, however, staying on his car, took up a dart<br>equipped with a golden handle and a very keen point, and steeped in oil<br>and exceedingly bright. It resembled, O lord, a she-snake of virulent<br>poison, frequently darting out her tongue. Raising that weapon he hurled<br>it at Satyasena in that encounter. That dart, O king, pierced the heart<br>of Satyasena in that battle and reduced it into a hundred fragments.<br>Deprived of his senses and life, he fell down upon the Earth from his<br>car. Beholding his brother slain, Sushena, insensate with rage, suddenly<br>made Nakula carless in that battle. Without losing a moment, he poured<br>his arrows over the son of Pandu fighting on foot. Seeing Nakula carless,<br>the mighty car-warrior Sutasoma, the son of Draupadi, rushed to that spot<br>for rescuing his sire in battle. Mounting then upon the car of Sutasoma,<br>Nakula, that hero of Bharata's race, looked beautiful like a lion upon a<br>mountain. Then taking up another bow, he fought with Sushena. Those two<br>great car-warriors, approaching each other, and shooting showers of<br>arrows, endeavoured to encompass each other's destruction. Then Sushena,<br>filled with rage, struck the son of Pandu with three shafts and Sutasoma<br>with twenty in the arms and the chest. At this, the impetuous Nakula, O<br>monarch, that slayer of hostile heroes, covered all the points of the<br>compass with arrows. Then taking up a sharp shaft endued with great<br>energy and equipped with a semi-circular head, Nakula sped it with great<br>force at Karna's son in that battle. With that arrow, O best of kings,<br>the son of Pandu cut off from Sushena's trunk the latter's head in the<br>very sight of all the troops. That feat seemed exceedingly wonderful.<br>Thus slain by the illustrious Nakula, Karna's son fell down like a lofty<br>tree on the bank of a river thrown down by the current of the stream.<br>Beholding the slaughter of Karna's sons and the prowess of Nakula, thy<br>army, O bull of Bharata's race, fled away in fear. Their commander,<br>however, the brave and valiant ruler of the Madras, that chastiser of<br>foes, then protected, O monarch, those troops in that battle. Rallying<br>his host, O king, Shalya stood fearlessly in battle, uttering loud<br>leonine roars and causing his bow to twang fiercely. Then thy troops, O<br>king, protected in battle by that firm bowman, cheerfully proceeded<br>against the foe once more from every side. Those high-souled warriors,<br>surrounding that great bowman, the ruler of the Madras, stood, O king,<br>desirous of battling on every side. Then Satyaki, and Bhimasena, and<br>those two Pandavas, the twin sons of Madri, placing that chastiser of<br>foes and abode of modesty, Yudhishthira, at their head, and surrounding<br>him on all sides in that battle, uttered leonine roars. And those heroes<br>also caused a loud whizz with the arrows they shot and frequently<br>indulged in diverse kinds of shouts. Smilingly, all thy warriors, filled<br>with rage, speedily encompassed the ruler of the Madras and stood from<br>desire of battle. Then commenced a battle, inspiring the timid with fear,<br>between thy soldiers and the enemy, both of whom made death their goal.<br>That battle between fearless combatants, enhancing the population of<br>Yama's kingdom, resembled, O monarch, that between the gods and the<br>Asuras in days of yore. Then the ape-bannered son of Pandu, O king,<br>having slaughtered the Samsaptakas in battle, rushed against that portion<br>of the Kaurava army. Smiling, all the Pandavas, headed by Dhrishtadyumna,<br>rushed against the same division, shooting showers of keen arrows.<br>Overwhelmed by the Pandavas, the Kaurava host became stupefied. Indeed,<br>those divisions then could not discern the cardinal point from the<br>subsidiary points of the compass. Covered with keen arrows sped by the<br>Pandavas, the Kaurava army, deprived of its foremost warriors, wavered<br>and broke on all sides. Indeed, O Kaurava, that host of thine began to be<br>slaughtered by the mighty car-warriors of the Pandavas. Similarly, the<br>Pandava host, O king, began to be slaughtered in hundreds and thousands<br>in that battle by thy sons on every side with their arrows. While the two<br>armies, exceedingly excited, were thus slaughtering each other, they<br>became much agitated like two streams in the season of rains. During the<br>progress of that dreadful battle, O monarch, a great fear entered the<br>hearts of thy warriors as also those of the Pandavas.'"
