                            Vaishampayana said, "Having passed one night more, Rama, having the<br>plough for his weapon, worshipped the dwellers of that tirtha and showed<br>his regard for Mankanaka. Having given wealth unto the Brahmanas, and<br>passed the night there, the hero having the plough for his weapon was<br>worshipped by the Munis. Rising up in the morning, he took leave of all<br>the ascetics, and having touched the sacred water, O Bharata, set out<br>quickly for other tirthas. Baladeva then went to the tirtha known by the<br>name of Usanas. It is also called Kapalamochana. Formerly, Rama (the son<br>of Dasaratha) slew a Rakshasa and hurled his head to a great distance.<br>That head, O king, fell upon the thigh of a great sage named Mahodara and<br>struck to it. Bathing in this tirtha, the great Rishi became freed from<br>the burthen. The high-souled Kavi (Sukra) had performed his ascetic<br>penances there. It was there that the whole science of politics and<br>morals (that goes by Sukra's name) appeared to him by inward light. While<br>residing there, Sukra meditated upon the war of the Daityas and the<br>Danavas (with the gods). Arrived at that foremost of tirthas, Baladeva, O<br>king, duly made presents unto the high-souled Brahmanas.'<br><br>Janamejaya said, "Why is it called Kapalamochana, where the great Muni<br>became freed (from the Rakshasa's head)? For what reason and how did that<br>head stick unto him?"<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "Formerly, O tiger among kings, the high-souled Rama<br>(the son of Dasaratha) lived (for some time) in the forest of Dandaka,<br>from desire of slaying the Rakshasas. At Janasthana he cut off the head<br>of a wicked-souled Rakshasa with a razor-headed shaft of great sharpness.<br>That head fell in the deep forest. That head, coursing at will (through<br>the welkin) fell upon the thigh of Mahodara while the latter was<br>wandering through the woods. Piercing his thigh, O king, it struck to it<br>and remained there. In consequence of that head thus sticking to his<br>thigh, the Brahmana (Mahodara) of great wisdom could not (with ease)<br>proceed to tirthas and other sacred spots. Afflicted with great pain and<br>with putrid matter flowing from his thigh, he went to all the tirthas of<br>the Earth (one after another), as heard by us. He went to all the rivers<br>and to the ocean also. (Not finding any relief) the great ascetic spoke<br>of his sufferings to many Rishis of cleansed souls about his having<br>bathed in all the tirthas without having found the relief he sought. That<br>foremost of Brahmanas then heard from those sages words of high import<br>about this foremost of tirthas situate on the Sarasvati, and known by the<br>name of Usanasa, which was represented as competent to cleanse from every<br>sin and as an excellent spot for attaining to (ascetic) success. That<br>Brahmana, then, repairing to that Usanasa tirtha, bathed in its waters.<br>Upon this, the Rakshasa's head, leaving the thigh, fell into the water.<br>Freed from that (dead) head, the Rishi felt great happiness. As regards<br>the head itself, it was lost in the waters. Mahodara then, O king, freed<br>from the Rakshasa's head, cheerfully returned, with cleansed soul and all<br>his sins washed away, to his asylum after achieving success. The great<br>ascetic thus freed, after returning to his sacred asylum, spoke of what<br>had happened to those Rishis of cleansed souls. The assembled Rishis,<br>having heard his words, bestowed the name of Kapalamochana on the tirtha.<br>The great Rishi Mahodara, repairing once more to that foremost of<br>tirthas, drank its water and attained to great ascetic success. He of<br>Madhu's race, having given away much wealth unto the Brahmanas and<br>worshipped them, then proceeded to the asylum of Rushangu. There, O<br>Bharata, Arshtishena had in former days undergone the austerest of<br>penances. There the great Muni Vishvamitra (who had before been a<br>Kshatriya) became a Brahmana. That great asylum is capable of granting<br>the fruition of every wish. It is always, O lord, the abode of Munis and<br>Brahmanas. Baladeva of great beauty, surrounded by Brahmanas, then went<br>to that spot, O monarch, where Rushangu had, in former days, cast off his<br>body. Rushangu, O Bharata, was an old Brahmana, who was always devoted to<br>ascetic penances. Resolved to cast off his body, he reflected for a long<br>while. Endued with great ascetic merit, he then summoned all his sons and<br>told them to take him to a spot where water was abundant. Those ascetics,<br>knowing their sire had become very old, took that ascetic to a tirtha on<br>the Sarasvati. Brought by his sons to the sacred Sarasvati containing<br>hundreds of tirthas and on whose banks dwelt Rishis unconnected with the<br>world, that intelligent ascetic of austere penance bathed in that tirtha<br>according to due rites, and that foremost of Rishis conversant with the<br>merits of tirthas, then cheerfully said, O tiger among men, unto all his<br>sons, who were dutifully waiting upon him, these words, 'He that would<br>cast off his body on the northern bank of the Sarasvati containing much<br>water, while employed in mentally reciting sacred mantras, would never<br>again be afflicted with death!' The righteoussouled Baladeva, touching<br>the water of that tirtha and bathing in it, gave considerable wealth unto<br>the Brahmanas, being devoted to them. Possessed of great might and great<br>prowess Baladeva then proceeded to that tirtha where the adorable<br>Grandsire had created the mountains called Lokaloka, where that foremost<br>of Rishis, Arshtishena of rigid vows, O thou of Kuru's race, had by<br>austere penances acquired the status of Brahmanhood, where the royal sage<br>Sindhudwipa, and the great ascetic Devapi, and the adorable and<br>illustrious Muni Vishvamitra of austere penances and fierce energy, had<br>all acquired a similar status."
