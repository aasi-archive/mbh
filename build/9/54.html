                            Vaishampayana said, "Having visited Kurukshetra and given away wealth<br>there, he of the Satwata race then proceeded, O Janamejaya, to a large<br>and exceedingly beautiful hermitage. That hermitage was overgrown with<br>Madhuka and mango trees, and abounded with Plakshas and Nyagrodhas. And<br>it contained many Vilwas and many excellent jack and Arjuna trees.<br>Beholding that goodly asylum with many marks of sacredness, Baladeva<br>asked the Rishis as to whose it was. Those high-souled ones, O king, said<br>unto Baladeva, 'Listen in detail, O Rama, as to whose asylum this was in<br>days of yore! Here the god Vishnu in days of yore performed austere<br>penances. Here he performed duly all the eternal sacrifices. Here a<br>Brahmani maiden, leading from youth the vow of Brahmacharya, became<br>crowned with ascetic success. Ultimately, in the possession of Yoga<br>powers, that lady of ascetic penances proceeded to heaven. The<br>high-souled Sandilya, O king, got a beautiful daughter who was chaste,<br>wedded to severe vows, self-restrained, and observant of Brahmacharya.<br>Having performed the severest of penances such as are incapable of being<br>performed by women, the blessed lady at last went to heaven, worshipped<br>by the gods and Brahmanas!' Having heard these words of the Rishis,<br>Baladeva entered that asylum. Bidding farewell to the Rishis, Baladeva of<br>unfading glory went through the performance of all the rites and<br>ceremonies of the evening twilight on the side of Himavat and then began<br>his ascent of the mountain. The mighty Balarama having the device of the<br>palmyra on his banner had not proceeded far in his ascent when he beheld<br>a sacred and goodly tirtha and wondered at the sight. Beholding the glory<br>of the Sarasvati, as also the tirtha called Plakshaprasravana, Vala next<br>reached another excellent and foremost of tirthas called Karavapana. The<br>hero of the plough, of great strength, having made many presents there,<br>bathed in the cool, clear, sacred, and sin-cleansing water (of that<br>tirtha). Passing one night there with the ascetics and the Brahmanas,<br>Rama then proceeded to the sacred asylum of the Mitra-Varunas. From<br>Karavapana he proceeded to that spot on the Yamuna where in days of yore<br>Indra and Agni and Aryaman had obtained great happiness. Bathing there,<br>that bull of Yadu's race, of righteous soul, obtained great happiness.<br>The hero then sat himself down with the Rishis and the Siddhas there for<br>listening to their excellent talk. There where Rama sat in the midst of<br>that conclave, the adorable Rishi Narada came (in course of his<br>wandering). Covered with matted locks and attired in golden rays, he bore<br>in his hands, O king, a staff made of gold and a waterpot made of the<br>same precious metal. Accomplished in song and dance and adored by gods<br>and Brahmanas, he had with him a beautiful Vina of melodious notes, made<br>of the tortoise-shell. A provoker of quarrels and ever fond of quarrels,<br>the celestial Rishi came to that spot where the handsome Rama was<br>resting. Standing up and sufficiently honouring the celestial Rishi of<br>regulated vows, Rama asked him about all that had happened to the Kurus.<br>Conversant with every duty and usage, Narada then, O king, told him<br>everything, as it had happened, about the awful extermination of the<br>Kurus. The son of Rohini then, in sorrowful words, enquired of the Rishi,<br>saying, 'What is the state of the field? How are those kings now that had<br>assembled there? I have heard everything before, O thou that art<br>possessed of the wealth of penances, but my curiosity is great for<br>hearing it in detail!'<br><br>"Narada said, 'Already Bhishma and Drona and the lord of the Sindhus have<br>fallen! Vikartana's son Karna also hath fallen, with his sons, those<br>great car-warriors! Bhurishrava too, O son of Rohini, and the valiant<br>chief of the Madras have fallen! Those and many other mighty heroes that<br>had assembled there, ready to lay down their lives for the victory of<br>Duryodhana, those kings and princes unreturning from battle, have all<br>fallen! Listen now to me, O Madhava, about those that are yet alive! In<br>the army of Dhritarashtra's son, only three grinders of hosts are yet<br>alive! They are Kripa and Kritavarma and the valiant son of Drona! These<br>also, O Rama, have from fear fled away to the ten points of the compass!<br>After Shalya's fall and the flight of Kripa and the others, Duryodhana,<br>in great grief, had entered the depths of the Dvaipayana lake. While<br>lying stretched for rest at the bottom of the lake after stupefying its<br>waters, Duryodhana was approached by the Pandavas with Krishna and<br>pierced by them with their cruel words. Pierced with wordy darts, O Rama,<br>from every side, the mighty and heroic Duryodhana hath risen from the<br>lake armed with his heavy mace. He hath come forward for fighting Bhima<br>for the present. Their terrible encounter, O Rama, will take place today!<br>If thou feelest any curiosity, then hasten, O Madhava, without tarrying<br>here! Go, if thou wishest, and witness that terrible battle between thy<br>two disciples!'"<br><br>Vaishampayana continued, "Hearing these words of Narada, Rama bade a<br>respectful farewell to those foremost of Brahmanas and dismissed all<br>those that had accompanied him (in his pilgrimage). Indeed, he ordered<br>his attendants, saying, 'Return ye to Dwaraka!' He then descended from<br>that prince of mountains and that fair hermitage called<br>Plakshaprasravana. Having listened to the discourse of the sages about<br>the great merits of tirthas, Rama of unfading glory sang this verse in<br>the midst of the Brahmanas, 'Where else is such happiness as that in a<br>residence by the Sarasvati? Where also such merits as those in a<br>residence by the Sarasvati? Men have departed for heaven, having<br>approached the Sarasvati! All should ever remember the Sarasvati!<br>Sarasvati is the most sacred of rivers! Sarasvati always bestows the<br>greatest happiness on men! Men, after approaching the Sarasvati, will not<br>have to grieve for their sins either here or hereafter!' Repeatedly<br>casting his eyes with joy on the Sarasvati, that scorcher of foes then<br>ascended an excellent car unto which were yoked goodly steeds. Journeying<br>then on that car of great fleetness, Baladeva, that bull of Yadu's race,<br>desirous of beholding the approaching encounter of his two disciples<br>arrived on the field."
