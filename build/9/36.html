                            Vaishampayana said, "Baladeva (as already said), proceeded next to the<br>tirtha called Udapana in the Sarasvati, that had formerly been the<br>residence, O king, of the illustrious (ascetic) Trita. Having given away<br>much wealth and worshipped the Brahmanas, the hero having the plough for<br>his weapon bathed there and became filled with joy. Devoted to<br>righteousness, the great ascetic Trita had lived there. While in a hole,<br>that high-souled one had drunk the Soma juice. His two brothers, dashing<br>him down into that pit, had returned to their home. That foremost of<br>Brahmanas, Trita, had thereupon cursed them both."<br><br>Janamejaya said, "What is the origin of Udapana? How did the great<br>ascetic (Trita) fall into a pit, there? Why was that foremost of<br>Brahmanas thrown into that pit by his brothers? How did his brothers,<br>after throwing him into that hole, return home? How did Trita perform his<br>sacrifice and how did he drink Soma? Tell me all this, O Brahmana, if<br>thou thinkest that I may listen to it without impropriety!"<br><br>Vaishampayana continued, "In a former Yuga, O king, there were three<br>brothers that were ascetics. They were called Ekata, Dwita, and Trita,<br>and all three were endued with effulgence like that of the sun. They were<br>like Lords of the creation and were blessed with children. Utterers of<br>Brahma, they had by their penances, acquired the privilege of attaining<br>to the regions of Brahman (after death). With their penances, vows, and<br>self-restraint, their sire Gautama, who was ever devoted to virtue,<br>became highly and always pleased with them. Having obtained great joy in<br>consequence of his sons, the adorable Gautama, after passing a long life<br>here, went at last to the region (in the other world) that was fit for<br>him. Those kings, however, O monarch, that had been the Yajamanas of<br>Gautama, continued to worship Gautama's sons after the sire had proceeded<br>to heaven. Amongst them, however, Trita, by his acts and study (of the<br>Vedas), O king, became the foremost, even like his sire Gautama. Then all<br>the highly blessed ascetics, characterised by righteousness, began to<br>worship Trita as they had worshipped his sire Gautama before him. Once<br>upon a time, the two brothers Ekata and Dwita thought of performing a<br>sacrifice and became anxious for wealth. The plan they formed, O scorcher<br>of foes, was to take Trita with them, and calling upon all their<br>Yajamanas and collecting the needful number of animals, they would<br>joyfully drink the Soma juice and acquire the great merits of sacrifice.<br>The three brothers then, O monarch, did as settled. Calling upon all<br>their Yajamanas for (obtaining) animals, and assisting them in their<br>sacrifices and receiving a large number of animals from them, and having<br>duly accepted them in gift in consequence of those priestly services<br>which they rendered, those high-souled and great Rishis came towards the<br>east. Trita, O king, with a cheerful heart was walking before them. Ekata<br>and Dwita were in his rear, bringing up the animals. Beholding that large<br>herd of animals, they began to reflect as to how they two could<br>appropriate that property without giving a share unto Trita. Hear, O<br>king, what those two sinful wretches, Ekata and Dwita, said while<br>conversing with each other! They said, 'Trita is skilled in assisting at<br>sacrifices. Trita is devoted to the Vedas. Trita is capable of earning<br>many other kine. Let us two, therefore, go away, taking the kine with us!<br>Let Trita go whithersoever he chooses, without being in our company!' As<br>they proceeded, night came upon them on the way. They then saw a wolf<br>before them. Not far from that spot was a deep hole on the bank of the<br>Sarasvati. Trita, who was in advance of his brothers, seeing the wolf,<br>ran in fright and fell into that hole. That hole was fathomless and<br>terrible and capable of inspiring all creatures with fear. Then Trita, O<br>king, that best of ascetics, from within that hole, began to utter wails<br>of woe. His two brothers heard his cries. Understanding that he had<br>fallen into a pit, his brothers Ekata and Dwita, moved by fear of the<br>wolf as also by temptation, went on, deserting their brother. Thus<br>deserted by his two brothers, who were moved by the temptation of<br>appropriating those animals, the great ascetic Trita, O king, while<br>within that lonely well covered with dust and herbs and creepers, thought<br>himself plunged, O chief of the Bharatas, into hell itself like a sinful<br>wretch. He feared to die inasmuch as he had not earned the merit of<br>drinking Soma juice. Possessed of great wisdom, he began to reflect with<br>the aid of his intelligence as to how he could succeed in drinking Soma<br>even there. While thinking on that subject, the great ascetic, standing<br>in that pit, beheld a creeper hanging down into it in course of its<br>growth. Although the pit was dry, the sage imagined the existence of<br>water and of sacrificial fires there. Constituting himself the Hotri (in<br>imagination), the great ascetic imagined the creeper he saw to be the<br>Soma plant. He then mentally uttered the Richs, the Yayushes and the<br>Samans (that were necessary for the performance of a sacrifice). The<br>pebbles (lying at the bottom of the well) Trita converted into grains of<br>sugar (in imagination). He then, O king, (mentally) performed his<br>ablutions. He conceived the water (he had imagined) to be clarified<br>butter. He allotted to the celestials their respective shares (of those<br>sacrificial offerings). Having next (mentally) drunk Soma, he began to<br>utter a loud noise. Those sounds, O king, first uttered by the<br>sacrificing Rishi, penetrated into heaven, and Trita completed that<br>sacrifice after the manner laid down by utterers of Brahma. During the<br>progress of that sacrifice of the high-souled Trita, the whole region of<br>the celestials became agitated. None knew, however, the cause. Brihaspati<br>(the preceptor of the gods) heard that loud noise (made by Trita). The<br>priests of the celestials said unto the latter, 'Trita is performing a<br>sacrifice. We must go there, ye gods! Endued with great ascetic merit, if<br>angry, he is competent to create other gods!' Hearing these words of<br>Brihaspati, all the gods, united together, repaired to that spot where<br>the sacrifice of Trita was going on. Having proceeded to that spot, the<br>gods beheld the high-souled Trita installed in the performance of his<br>sacrifice. Beholding that high-souled one resplendent with beauty, the<br>gods addressed him, saying, 'We have come hither for our shares (in thy<br>offerings)!' The Rishi said unto them, 'Behold me, ye denizens of heaven,<br>fallen into this terrible well, almost deprived of my senses!' Then,<br>Trita, O monarch, duly gave unto them their shares with proper mantras.<br>The gods took them and became very glad. Having duly obtained their<br>allotted shares, the denizens of heaven, gratified with him, gave him<br>such boons as he desired. The boon, however, that he solicited was that<br>the gods should relieve him from his distressful situation (in the well).<br>He also said, 'Let him that bathes in this well, have the end that is<br>attained by persons that have drunk Soma!' At these words, O king, the<br>Sarasvati with her waves appeared within that well. Raised aloft by her,<br>Trita came up and worshipped the denizens of heaven. The gods then said<br>unto him 'Be it as thou wishest!' All of them, then, O king, went to the<br>place whence they had come, and Trita, filled with joy, proceeded to his<br>own abode. Meeting with those two Rishis, his brothers, he became enraged<br>with them. Possessed of great ascetic merit, he said certain harsh words<br>unto them and cursed them, saying, 'Since, moved by covetousness, you ran<br>away, deserting me, therefore, you shall become fierce wolves with sharp<br>teeth and range the forest, cursed by me in consequence of that sinful<br>act of yours! The offspring also that you shall have will consist of<br>leopards, and bears and apes!' After Trita had said these words, O<br>monarch, his two brothers were seen to be very soon transformed into<br>these shapes in consequence of the words of that truthful sage. Of<br>immeasurable prowess, Valadeva touched the waters of Udapana. And he gave<br>away diverse kinds of wealth there and worshipped many Brahmanas.<br>Beholding Udapana and applauding it repeatedly, Valadeva next proceeded<br>to Vinasana which also was on the Sarasvati."
