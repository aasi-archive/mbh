                            Vaishampayana said, "Listen now to the large bands of the mothers, those<br>slayers of foes, O hero, that became the companions of Kumara, as I<br>mention their names. Listen, O Bharata, to the names of those illustrious<br>mothers. The mobile and immobile universe is pervaded by those auspicious<br>ones.

Their<br>nails were long, their teeth were large and their lips also, O Bharata,<br>were protruding. Of straight forms and sweet features, all of them,<br>endowed with youth, were decked with ornaments. Possessed of ascetic<br>merit, they were capable of assuming any form at will. Having not much<br>flesh on their limbs, they were of fair complexions and endued with<br>splendour like that of gold. Some amongst them were dark and looked like<br>clouds in hue and some were of the colour of smoke, O bull of Bharata's<br>race. And some were endued with the splendour of the morning sun and were<br>highly blessed. Possessed of long tresses, they were clad in robes of<br>white. The braids of some were tied upwards, and the eyes of some were<br>tawny, and some had girdles that were very long. Some had long stomachs,<br>some had long ears, and some had long breasts. Some had coppery eyes and<br>coppery complexion, and the eyes of some were green.<br><br>Capable of granting boons and of travelling at will, they were always<br>cheerful. Possessed of great strength, some amongst them partook of the<br>nature of Yama, some of Rudra, some of Soma, some of Kuvera, some of<br>Varuna, some of Indra, and some of Agni, O scorcher of foes. And some<br>partook of the nature of Vayu, some of Kumara, some of Brahma, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, and some of Vishnu and some of Surya, and some of Varaha.<br><br>Of charming and delightful features, they were beautiful like the asuras.<br>In voice they resembled the kokila and in prosperity they resembled the<br>Lord of Treasures. In battle, their energy resembled that of Shakra. In<br>splendour they resembled fire. In battle they always inspired their foes<br>with terror. Capable of assuming any form at will, in fleetness they<br>resembled the very wind. Of inconceivable might and energy, their prowess<br>also was inconceivable.<br><br>They have their abodes on trees and open spots and crossings of four<br>roads. They live also in caves and crematoriums, mountains and springs.<br>Adorned with diverse kinds of ornaments, they wear diverse kinds of<br>attire, and speak diverse languages. These and many other tribes (of the<br>mothers), all capable of inspiring foes with dread, followed the<br>high-souled Kartikeya at the command of the chief of the celestials.<br><br>The adorable chastiser of Paka, O tiger among kings, gave unto Guha<br>(Kartikeya) a dart for the destruction of the enemies of the gods. That<br>dart produces a loud whiz and is adorned with many large bells. Possessed<br>of great splendour, it seemed to blaze with light. And Indra also gave<br>him a banner effulgent as the morning sun. Shiva gave him a large army,<br>exceedingly fierce and armed with diverse kinds of weapons, and endued<br>with great energy begotten of ascetic penances. Invincible and possessing<br>all the qualities of a good army, that force was known by the name of<br>dhananjaya. It was protected by thirty 30,000 warriors each of whom was<br>possessed of might equal to that of Rudra himself. That force knew not<br>how to fly from battle. Vishnu gave him a triumphal garland that enhances<br>the might of the wearer. Uma gave him two pieces of cloth of effulgence<br>like that of the Sun. With great pleasure Ganga gave unto Kumara a<br>celestial water-pot, begotten of amrita, and Brihaspati gave him a sacred<br>stick. Garuda gave him his favourite son, a peacock of beautiful<br>feathers. Aruna gave him a cock of sharp talons. The royal Varuna gave<br>him a snake of great energy and might. The lord Brahma gave unto that god<br>devoted to Brahman a black deer-skin. And the Creator of all the worlds<br>also gave him victory in all battles.<br><br>Having obtained the command of the celestial forces, Skanda looked<br>resplendent like a blazing fire of bright flames. Accompanied by those<br>companions and the mothers, he proceeded for the destruction of the<br>daityas, gladdening all the foremost of the gods. The terrible host of<br>celestials, furnished with standards adorned with bells, and equipped<br>with drums and conchs and cymbals, and armed with weapons, and decked<br>with many banners, looked beautiful like the autumnal firmament<br>bespangled with planets and stars.<br><br>Then that vast assemblage of celestials and diverse kinds of creatures<br>began cheerfully to beat their drums and blow their conchs numbering<br>thousands. And they also played on their patahas and jharjharas and<br>krikacas and cow-horns and adambaras and gomukhas and dindimas of loud<br>sound. All the gods, with Vasava at their head, praised Kumara. The<br>celestials and the gandharvas sang and the apsaras danced.<br><br>Well-pleased (with these attentions) Skanda granted a boon unto all the<br>gods, saying, 'I shall slay all your foes,' then, that is, that desire to<br>slay you. Having obtained this boon from that best of gods, the<br>illustrious celestials regarded their foes to be already slain. After<br>Skanda had granted that boon, a loud sound arose from all those creatures<br>inspired with joy, filling the three worlds.<br><br>Accompanied by that vast host, Skanda then set out for the destruction of<br>the daityas and the protection of the denizens of heaven. Exertion, and<br>Victory, and Righteousness, and Success, and Prosperity, and Courage, and<br>the Scriptures (in their embodied forms) proceeded in the van of<br>Kartikeya's army, O king! With that terrible force, which was armed with<br>lances, mallets, blazing brands, maces, heavy clubs, arrows, darts and<br>spears, and which was decked with beautiful ornaments and armour, and<br>which uttered roars like those of a proud lion, the divine Guha set out.<br><br>Beholding him, all the daityas, rakshasas and danavas, anxious with fear,<br>fled away on all sides. Armed with diverse weapons, the celestials<br>pursued them. Seeing (the foe flying away), Skanda, endued with energy<br>and might, became inflamed with wrath. He repeatedly hurled his terrible<br>weapon, the dart (he had received from Agni). The energy that he then<br>displayed resembled a fire fed with libations of clarified butter. While<br>the dart was repeatedly hurled by Skanda of immeasurable energy, meteoric<br>flashes, O king, fell upon the Earth. Thunderbolts also, with tremendous<br>noise, fell upon the earth. Everything became as frightful O king, as it<br>becomes on the day of universal destruction. When that terrible dart was<br>once hurled by the son of Agni, millions of darts issued from it, O bull<br>of Bharata's race.<br><br>The puissant and adorable Skanda, filled with joy, at last slew Taraka,<br>the chief of the daityas, endued with great might and prowess, and<br>surrounded (in that battle) by a 100,000 heroic and mighty daityas. He<br>then, in that battle, slew Mahisha who was surrounded by eight padmas of<br>daityas. He next slew Tripada who was surrounded by a 1,000 ajutas of<br>daityas. The puissant Skanda then slew Hradodara, who was surrounded by<br>ten nikharvas of daityas, with all his followers armed with diverse<br>weapons. Filling the ten points of the compass, the followers of Kumara,<br>O king, made a loud noise while those daityas were being slain, and<br>danced and jumped and laughed in joy.<br><br>Thousands of daityas, O king, were burnt with the flames that issued from<br>Skanda's dart, while others breathed their last, terrified by the roars<br>of Skanda. The three worlds were frightened at the yawns of Skanda's<br>soldiers. The foes were consumed with flames produced by Skanda. Many<br>were slain by his roars alone. Some amongst the foes of the gods, struck<br>with banners, were slain. Some, frightened by the sounds of bells, fell<br>down on the surface of the Earth. Some, mangled with weapons, fell down,<br>deprived of life. In this way the heroic and mighty Kartikeya slew<br>innumerable foes of the gods possessed of great strength that came to<br>fight with him.<br><br>Then Bali's son Vana of great might, getting upon the Kraunca mountain,<br>battled with the celestial host. Possessed of great intelligence, the<br>great generalissimo Skanda rushed against that foe of the gods. From fear<br>of Kartikeya, he took shelter within the Kraunca mountain. Inflamed with<br>rage, the adorable Kartikeya then pierced that mountain with that dart<br>given him by Agni. The mountain was called Kraunca (crane) because of the<br>sound it always produced resembled the cry of a crane. That mountain was<br>variegated with shala trees. The apes and elephants on it were<br>affrighted. The birds that had their abode on it rose up and wheeled<br>around in the welkin. The snakes began to dart down its sides. It<br>resounded also with the cries of leopards and bears in large numbers that<br>ran hither and thither in fear. Other forests on it rang with the cries<br>of hundreds upon hundreds of animals. Sharabhas and lions suddenly ran<br>out. In consequence of all this that mountain, though it was reduced to a<br>very pitiable plight, still assumed a very beautiful aspect. The<br>vidyadharas dwelling on its summits soared into the air. The kinnaras<br>also became very anxious, distracted by the fear caused by the fall of<br>Skanda's dart. The daityas then, by hundreds and thousands, came out of<br>that blazing mountain, all clad in beautiful ornaments and garlands.<br><br>The followers of Kumara, prevailing over them in battle, slew them all.<br>The adorable Skanda, inflamed with rage, quickly slew the son of daitya<br>chief (Bali) along with his younger brother, even as Indra had slain<br>Vritra (in days before). The slayer of hostile heroes, Agni's son,<br>pierced with his dart the Kraunca mountain, dividing his own self<br>sometimes into many and sometimes uniting all his portions into one.<br>Repeatedly hurled from his hand, the dart repeatedly came back to him.<br>Even such was the might and glory of the adorable son of Agni. With<br>redoubled heroism, and energy and fame and success, the god pierced the<br>mountain and slew hundreds of daityas. The adorable god, having thus<br>slain the enemies of the celestials, was worshipped and honoured by the<br>latter and obtained great joy.<br><br>After the Kraunca mountain had been pierced and after the son of Canda<br>had been slain, drums were beaten, O king, and conchs were blown. The<br>celestial ladies rained floral showers in succession upon that divine<br>lord of yogis. Auspicious breezes began to blow, bearing celestial<br>perfumes. The gandharvas hymned his praises, as also great rishis always<br>engaged in the performance of sacrifices. Some speak of him as the<br>puissant son of the Grandsire, Sanat-kumara, the eldest of all the sons<br>of Brahma. Some speak of him as the son of Maheshvara, and some as that<br>of Agni. Some again describe him as the son of Uma or of the Krittikas or<br>of Ganga. Hundreds and thousands of people speak of that Lord of yogis of<br>blazing form and great might, as the son of one of those, or of either of<br>two of those, or of any one of four of those.<br><br>I have thus told thee, O king, everything about the installation of<br>Kartikeya. Listen now to the history of the sacredness of that foremost<br>of tirthas on the Sarasvati. That foremost of tirthas, O monarch, after<br>the enemies of the gods had been slain, became a second heaven. The<br>puissant son of Agni gave unto each of the foremost ones among the<br>celestials diverse kinds of dominion and affluence and at last the<br>sovereignty of the three worlds. Even thus, O monarch, was that adorable<br>exterminator of the daityas installed by the gods as their generalissimo.<br>That other tirtha, O bull of Bharata's race, where in days of yore Varuna<br>the lord of waters had been installed by the celestials, is known by the<br>name of Taijasa. Having bathed in that tirtha and adored Skanda, Rama<br>gave unto the brahmanas gold and clothes and ornaments and other things.<br>Passing one night there, that slayer of hostile heroes, Madhava, praising<br>that foremost of tirthas and touching its water, became cheerful and<br>happy. I have now told thee everything about which thou hadst enquired,<br>how the divine Skanda was installed by the assembled gods!"
