                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then, O lord, thy troops, with Shalya at their head, once<br>more rushed against the Parthas in that battle with great impetuosity.<br>Although afflicted, still these troops of thine, who were fierce in<br>battle, rushing against the Parthas, very soon agitated them in<br>consequence of their superior numbers. Struck by the Kurus, the Pandava<br>troops, in the very sight of the two Krishnas, stayed not on the field,<br>though sought to be checked by Bhimasena. Filled with rage at this,<br>Dhananjaya covered Kripa and his followers, as also Kritavarma, with<br>showers of shafts. Sahadeva checked Shakuni with all his forces. Nakula<br>cast his glances on the ruler of the Madras from one of his flanks. The<br>(five) sons of Draupadi checked numerous kings (of the Kuru army). The<br>Pancala prince Shikhandi resisted the son of Drona. Armed with his mace,<br>Bhimasena held the king in check, and Kunti's son Yudhishthira resisted<br>Shalya at the head of his forces. The battle then commenced once more<br>between those pairs as they stood, among thy warriors and those of the<br>enemy, none of whom had ever retreated from fight. We then beheld the<br>highly wonderful feat that Shalya achieved, since, alone, he fought with<br>the whole Pandava army. Shalya then, as he stayed in the vicinity of<br>Yudhishthira in that battle, looked like the planet Saturn in the<br>vicinity of the Moon. Afflicting the king with shafts that resembled<br>snakes of virulent poison, Shalya rushed against Bhima, covering him with<br>showers of arrows. Beholding that lightness of hand and that mastery over<br>weapons displayed by Shalya the troops of both the armies applauded him<br>highly. Afflicted by Shalya the Pandavas, exceedingly mangled, fled away,<br>leaving the battle, and disregarding the cries of Yudhishthira commanding<br>them to stop. While his troops were thus being slaughtered by the ruler<br>of the Madras, Pandu's son, king Yudhishthira the just, became filled<br>with rage. Relying upon his prowess, that mighty car-warrior began to<br>afflict the ruler of the Madras, resolved to either win the battle or<br>meet with death. Summoning all his brothers and also Krishna of Madhu's<br>race, he said unto them, "Bhishma, and Drona, and Karna, and the other<br>kings, that put forth their prowess for the sake of the Kauravas, have<br>all perished in battle. You all have exerted your valour according to<br>your courage and in respect of the shares allotted to you. Only one<br>share&#8212;mine&#8212;that is constituted by the mighty car-warrior Shalya,<br>remains. I desire to vanquish that ruler of the Madras today in battle.<br>Whatever wishes I have regarding the accomplishment of that task I will<br>now tell you. These two heroes, the two sons of Madravati, will become<br>the protectors of my wheels. They are counted as heroes incapable of<br>being vanquished by Vasava himself. Keeping the duties of a Kshatriya<br>before them, these two that are deserving of every honour and are firm in<br>their vows, will fight with their maternal uncle. Either Shalya will slay<br>me in battle or I will slay him. Blessed be ye. Listen to these true<br>words, you foremost of heroes in the world. Observant of Kshatriya<br>duties, I will fight with my maternal uncle, you lords of Earth, firmly<br>resolved to either obtain victory or be slain. Let them that furnish cars<br>quickly supply my vehicle, according to the rules of science, with<br>weapons and all kinds of implements in a larger measure than Shalya's.<br>The grandson of Sini will protect my right wheel, and Dhrishtadyumna my<br>left. Let Pritha's son Dhananjaya guard my rear today. And let Bhima,<br>that foremost of all wielders of weapons, fight in my front. I shall thus<br>be superior to Shalya in the great battle that will occur." Thus<br>addressed by the king, all his well-wishers did as they were requested.<br>Then the Pandava troops once more became filled with joy, especially the<br>Pancalas, the Somakas and the Matsyas. Having made that vow, the king<br>proceeded against the ruler of the Madras. The Pancalas then blew and<br>beat innumerable conchs and drums and uttered leonine roars. Endued with<br>great activity and filled with rage, they rushed, with loud shouts of<br>joy, against the ruler of the Madras, that bull among the Kurus. And they<br>caused the Earth to resound with the noise of the elephants' bells, and<br>the loud blare of conchs and trumpets. Then thy son and the valiant ruler<br>of the Madras, like the Udaya and the Asta hills, received those<br>assailants. Boasting of his prowess in battle, Shalya poured a shower of<br>arrows on that chastiser of foes, king Yudhishthira the just, like<br>Maghavat pouring rain. The high-souled king of the Kurus also having<br>taken up his beautiful bow displayed those diverse kinds of lessons that<br>Drona had taught him. And he poured successive showers of arrows<br>beautifully, quickly, and with great skill. As he careered in battle,<br>none could mark any lapses in him. Shalya and Yudhishthira, both endued<br>with great prowess in battle, mangled each other, like a couple of tigers<br>fighting for a piece of meat. Bhima was engaged with thy son, that<br>delighter in battle. The Pancala prince (Dhrishtadyumna), Satyaki, and<br>the two sons of Madri by Pandu, received Shakuni and the other Kuru<br>heroes around. In consequence of thy evil policy, O king, there again<br>occurred in that spot an awful battle between thy warriors and those of<br>the foe, all of whom were inspired with the desire of victory. Duryodhana<br>then, with a straight shaft, aiming at the gold-decked standard of Bhima,<br>cut off in that battle. The beautiful standard of Bhimasena, adorned with<br>many bells, fell down, O giver of honours. Once more the king, with a<br>sharp razor-faced arrow, cut off the beautiful bow of Bhima that looked<br>like the trunk of an elephant. Endued with great energy, the bowless<br>Bhima then, putting forth his prowess pierced the chest of thy son with a<br>dart. At this, thy son sat down on the terrace of his car. When<br>Duryodhana swooned away, Vrikodara once more, with razor-faced shaft, cut<br>off the head of his driver from his trunk. The steeds of Duryodhana's<br>car, deprived of their driver, ran wildly on all sides, O Bharata,<br>dragging the car after them, at which loud wails arose (in the Kuru<br>army). Then the mighty car-warrior Ashvatthama, and Kripa and Kritavarma,<br>followed that car, desirous of rescuing thy son. The (Kaurava) troops (at<br>sight of this) became exceedingly agitated. The followers of Duryodhana<br>became terrified. At that time, the wielder of Gandiva, drawing his bow,<br>began to slay them with his arrows. Then Yudhishthira, excited with rage,<br>rushed against the ruler of the Madras, himself urging his steeds white<br>as ivory and fleet as thought. We then saw something that was wonderful<br>in Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, for though very mild and soft, he then<br>became exceedingly fierce. With eyes opened wide and body trembling in<br>rage, the son of Kunti cut off hostile warriors in hundreds and thousands<br>by means of his sharp shafts. Those amongst the soldiers against whom the<br>eldest Pandava proceeded, were overthrown by him, O king, like mountain<br>summits riven with thunder. Felling cars with steeds and drivers and<br>standards and throwing down car-warriors in large numbers, Yudhishthira,<br>without any assistance, began to sport there like a mighty wind<br>destroying masses of clouds. Filled with rage, he destroyed steeds with<br>riders and steeds without riders and foot-soldiers by thousands in that<br>battle, like Rudra destroying living creatures (at the time of the<br>universal dissolution). Having made the field empty by shooting his<br>shafts on all sides, Yudhishthira rushed against the ruler of the Madras<br>and said, "Wait, Wait!" Beholding the feats then of that hero of terrible<br>deeds, all thy warriors became inspired with fear. Shalya, however,<br>proceeded against him. Both of them filled with rage, blew their conchs.<br>Returning and challenging each other, each then encountered the other.<br>Then Shalya covered Yudhishthira with showers of arrows. Similarly, the<br>son of Kunti covered the ruler of the Madras with showers of arrows. Then<br>those two heroes, the ruler of the Madras and Yudhishthira, mangled in<br>that battle with each other's arrows and bathed in blood, looked like a<br>Salmali and a Kinsuka tree decked with flowers. Both possessed of<br>splendour and both invincible in battle, those two illustrious warriors<br>uttered loud roars. Beholding them both, the soldiers could not conclude<br>which of them would be victorious. Whether the son of Pritha would enjoy<br>the Earth, having slain Shalya, or whether Shalya having slain the son of<br>Pandu would bestow the Earth on Duryodhana, could not be ascertained, O<br>Bharata, by the warriors present there. King Yudhishthira, in course of<br>that battle, placed his foes to his right. Then Shalya shot a hundred<br>foremost of arrows at Yudhishthira. With another arrow of great<br>sharpness, he cut off the latter's bow. Taking up another bow,<br>Yudhishthira pierced Shalya with three hundred shafts and cut off the<br>latter's bow with a razor-faced arrow. The son of Pandu then slew the<br>four steeds of his antagonist with some straight arrows. With two other<br>very sharp shafts, he then cut off the two Parshni drivers of Shalya.<br>Then with another blazing, well-tempered and sharp shaft, he cut off the<br>standard of Shalya staying in his front. Then, O chastiser of foes, the<br>army of Duryodhana broke. The son of Drona, at this time, speedily<br>proceeded towards the ruler of the Madras who had been reduced to that<br>plight, and quickly taking him up on his own car, fled away quickly.<br>After the two had proceeded for a moment, they heard Yudhishthira roar<br>aloud. Stopping, the ruler of the Madras then ascended another car that<br>had been equipped duly. That best of cars had a rattle deep as the roar<br>of the clouds. Well furnished with weapons and instruments and all kinds<br>of utensils, that vehicle made the hair of foes stand on end.'"
