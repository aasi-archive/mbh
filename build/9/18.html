                            "Sanjaya said, 'After the slaughter of Shalya, O king, the followers of<br>the Madra king, numbering seventeen hundred heroic car-warriors,<br>proceeded for battle with great energy. Duryodhana riding upon an<br>elephant gigantic as a hill, with an umbrella held over his head, and<br>fanned the while with yak-tails, forbade the Madraka warriors, saying,<br>"Do not proceed, Do not proceed!" Though repeatedly forbidden by<br>Duryodhana, those heroes, desirous of slaying Yudhishthira, penetrated<br>into the Pandava host. Those brave combatants, O monarch, loyal to<br>Duryodhana, twanging their bows loudly, fought with the Pandavas.<br>Meanwhile, hearing that Shalya had been slain and that Yudhishthira was<br>afflicted by the mighty car-warriors of the Madrakas devoted to the<br>welfare of the Madraka king, the great car-warrior Partha came there,<br>stretching his bow Gandiva, and filling the Earth with the rattle of his<br>car. Then Arjuna, and Bhima, and the two sons of Madri by Pandu, and that<br>tiger among men, Satyaki, and the (five) sons of Draupadi, and<br>Dhrishtadyumna, and Shikhandi, and the Pancalas and the Somakas, desirous<br>of rescuing Yudhishthira, surrounded him on all sides. Having taken their<br>places around the king, the Pandavas, those bulls among men, began to<br>agitate the hostile force like Makaras agitating the ocean. Indeed, they<br>caused thy army to tremble like a mighty tempest shaking the trees. Like<br>the great river Ganges agitated by a hostile wind, the Pandava host, O<br>king, once more became exceedingly agitated. Causing that mighty host to<br>tremble, the illustrious and mighty car-warriors (the Madrakas), all<br>shouted loudly, saying, "Where is that king Yudhishthira? Why are not his<br>brave brothers, the Pandavas, to be seen here? What has become of the<br>Pancalas of great energy as also of the mighty car-warrior Shikhandi?<br>Where are Dhrishtadyumna and the grandson of Sini and those great<br>car-warriors, the (five) sons of Draupadi?" At this, those mighty<br>warriors, the sons of Draupadi, began to slaughter the followers of the<br>Madra king who were uttering those words and battling vigorously. In that<br>battle, some amongst thy troops were seen slain by means of their lofty<br>standards. Beholding, however, the heroic Pandavas, the brave warriors of<br>thy army, O Bharata, though forbidden by thy son, still rushed against<br>them. Duryodhana, speaking softly, sought to prevent those warriors from<br>fighting with the foe. No great car-warrior, however, amongst them obeyed<br>his behest. Then Shakuni, the son of the Gandhara king, possessed of<br>eloquence, O monarch, said unto Duryodhana these words, "How is this that<br>we are standing here, while the Madraka host is being slaughtered before<br>our eyes? When thou, O Bharata, art here, this does not look well! The<br>understanding made was that all of us should fight unitedly! Why then, O<br>king, dost thou tolerate our foes when they are thus slaying our troops?"<br><br>"'Duryodhana said, "Though forbidden by me before, they did not obey my<br>behest. Unitedly have these men penetrated in the Pandava host!"<br><br>"'Shakuni said, "Brave warriors, when excited with rage in battle, do not<br>obey the command of their leaders. It does not behove thee to be angry<br>with those men. This is not the time to stand indifferently. We shall,<br>therefore, all of us, united together with our cars and horses and<br>elephants, proceed, for rescuing those great bowmen, the followers of the<br>Madra king! With great care, O king, we shall protect one another."<br>Thinking after the manner of Shakuni, all the Kauravas then proceeded to<br>that place where the Madras were. Duryodhana also, thus addressed (by his<br>maternal uncle) proceeded, encompassed by a large force, against the foe,<br>uttering leonine shouts and causing the Earth to resound with that noise.<br>"Slay, pierce, seize, strike, cut off!" These were the loud sounds that<br>were heard then, O Bharata, among those troops. Meanwhile the Pandavas,<br>beholding in that battle the followers of the Madra king assailing them<br>unitedly, proceeded against them, arraying themselves in the form called<br>Madhyama. Fighting hand to hand, O monarch, for a short while those<br>heroic warriors, the followers of the Madra king, were seen to perish.<br>Then, whilst we were proceeding, the Pandavas, united together and endued<br>with great activity, completed the slaughter of the Madrakas, and, filled<br>with delight, uttered joyous shouts. Then headless forms were seen to<br>arise all around. Large meteors seemed to fall down from the sun's disc.<br>The Earth became covered with cars and broken yokes and axles and slain<br>car-warriors and lifeless steeds. Steeds fleet as the wind, still<br>attached to yokes of cars (but without drivers to guide them) were seen<br>to drag car-warriors, O monarch, hither and thither on the field of<br>battle. Some horses were seen to drag cars with broken wheels, while some<br>ran on all sides, bearing after them portions of broken cars. Here and<br>there also were seen steeds that were hampered in their motions by their<br>traces. Car-warriors, while falling down from their cars, were seen to<br>drop down like denizens of heaven on the exhaustion of their merits. When<br>the brave followers of the Madra king were slain, the mighty car-warriors<br>of the Parthas, those great smiters, beholding a body of horse advancing<br>towards them, rushed towards it with speed from desire of victory.<br>Causing their arrows to whiz loudly and making diverse other kinds of<br>noise mingled with the blare of their conchs, those effectual smiters<br>possessed of sureness of aim, shaking their bows, uttered leonine roars.<br>Beholding then that large force of the Madra king exterminated and seeing<br>also their heroic king slain in battle, the entire army of Duryodhana<br>once more turned away from the field. Struck, O monarch, by those firm<br>bowmen, the Pandavas, the Kuru army fled away on all sides, inspired with<br>fear.'
