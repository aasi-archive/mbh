                            "Sanjaya said, 'Thus addressed by the celebrated grandson of Gotama, the<br>king (Duryodhana), breathing long and hot breaths, remained silent, O<br>monarch. Having reflected for a little while, the high-souled son of<br>Dhritarashtra, that scorcher of foes, then said these words unto<br>Saradwat's son Kripa, "Whatever a friend should say, thou hast said unto<br>me. Thou hast also, whilst battling, done everything for me, without<br>caring for thy very life. The world has seen thee penetrate into the<br>midst of the Pandava divisions and fight with the mighty car-warriors of<br>the Pandavas endued with great energy. That which should be said by a<br>friend hast been said by thee. Thy words, however, do not please me, like<br>medicine that ill pleases the person that is on the point of death. These<br>beneficial and excellent words, fraught with reason, that thou, O<br>mighty-armed one, hast said do not seem acceptable to me, O foremost of<br>Brahmanas. Deprived by us of his kingdom (on a former occasion), why will<br>the son of Pandu repose his trust on us? That mighty king was once<br>defeated by us at dice. Why will he again believe my words? So also,<br>Krishna, ever engaged in the good of the Parthas, when he came to us as<br>an envoy, was deceived by us. That act of ours was exceedingly<br>ill-judged. Why then, O regenerate one, will Hrishikesa trust my words?<br>The princess Krishna, while standing in the midst of the assembly, wept<br>piteously. Krishna will never forget that act of ours, nor that act, the<br>deprivation of Yudhishthira by us of his kingdom. Formerly, it was heard<br>by us that the two Krishnas have the same heart between them and are<br>firmly united with each other. Today, O lord, we have seen it with our<br>eyes. Having heard of the slaughter of his sister's son, Keshava passeth<br>his nights in sorrow. We have offended him highly. Why will he forgive us<br>then? Arjuna also, in consequence of Abhimanyu's death, hath become very<br>miserable. Even if solicited, why will he strike for my good? The second<br>son of Pandu, the mighty Bhimasena, is exceedingly fierce. He has made a<br>terrible vow. He will break but not bend. The heroic twins, breathing<br>animosity against us, when clad in mail and armed with their swords,<br>resemble a pair of Yamas. Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi have drawn their<br>swords against me. Why will those two, O best of Brahmanas, strive for my<br>good? While clad in a single raiment and in her season, the princess<br>Krishna was treated cruelly by Duhshasana in the midst of the assembly<br>and before the eyes of all. Those scorchers of foes, the Pandavas, who<br>still remember the naked Draupadi plunged into distress, can never be<br>dissuaded from battle.<br><br>"'"Then again, Krishna, the daughter of Drupada, is in sorrow, undergoing<br>the austerest of penances for my destruction and the success of the<br>objects cherished by her husbands, and sleepeth every day on the bare<br>ground, intending to do so till the end of the hostilities is attained.<br>Abandoning honour and pride, the uterine sister of Vasudeva (Subhadra) is<br>always serving Draupadi as veritable waiting woman. Everything,<br>therefore, hath flamed up. That fire can never be quenched. Peace with<br>them hath become impossible in consequence of the slaughter of Abhimanyu.<br>Having also enjoyed the sovereignty of this earth bounded by the ocean,<br>how shall I be able to enjoy, under favour of the Pandavas, a kingdom in<br>peace? Having shone like the Sun upon the heads of all the kings, how<br>shall I walk behind Yudhishthira like a slave? Having enjoyed all<br>enjoyable articles and shown great compassion, how shall I lead a<br>miserable life now, with miserable men as my companions? I do not hate<br>those mild and beneficial words that thou hast spoken. I, however, do not<br>think that this is the time for peace. To fight righteously is, O<br>scorcher of foes, what I regard to be good policy. This is not the time<br>for acting like a eunuch. On the other hand, that is time for the battle.<br>I have performed many sacrifices. I have given away Dakshinas to<br>Brahmanas, I have obtained the attainment of all my wishes. I have<br>listened to Vedic recitations. I have walked upon the heads of my foes.<br>My servants have all been wellcherished by me. I have relieved people in<br>distress. I dare not, O foremost of regenerate ones, address such humble<br>words to the Pandavas. I have conquered foreign kingdoms. I have properly<br>governed my own kingdom. I have enjoyed diverse kinds of enjoyable<br>articles. Religion and profit and pleasure I have pursued. I have paid<br>off my debt to the Pitris and to Kshatriya duty. Certainly, there is no<br>happiness here. What becomes of kingdom, and what of good name? Fame is<br>all that one should acquire here. That fame can be obtained by battle,<br>and by no other means. The death that a Kshatriya meets with at home is<br>censurable. Death on one's bed at home is highly sinful. The man who<br>casts away his body in the woods or in battle after having performed<br>sacrifices, obtains great glory. He is no man who dies miserably weeping<br>in pain, afflicted by disease and decay, in the midst of crying kinsmen.<br>Abandoning diverse objects of enjoyment, I shall now, by righteous<br>battle, proceed to the regions of Shakra, obtaining the companionship of<br>those that have attained to the highest end. Without doubt, the<br>habitation of heroes of righteous behaviour, who never retreat from<br>battle, who are gifted with intelligence and devoted to truth, who are<br>performers of sacrifices, and who have been sanctified in the sacrifice<br>of weapons, is in heaven. The diverse tribes of Apsaras, without doubt,<br>joyfully gaze at such heroes when engaged in battle. Without doubt, the<br>Pitris behold them worshipped in the assembly of the gods and rejoicing<br>in heaven, in the company of Apsaras. We will now ascend the path that is<br>trod by the celestials and by heroes unreturning from battle, that path<br>which has been taken by our venerable grandsire, by the preceptor endued<br>with great intelligence, by Jayadratha, by Karna, and by Duhshasana. Many<br>brave kings, who had exerted themselves vigorously for my sake in this<br>battle, have been slain. Mangled with arrows and their limbs bathed in<br>blood, they lie now on the bare Earth. Possessed of great courage and<br>conversant with excellent weapons, those kings, who had, again, performed<br>sacrifices as ordained in the scriptures, having cast off their life<br>breaths in the discharge of their duties, have now become the denizens of<br>Indra's abode. They have paved the way (to that blessed region). That<br>road will once more be difficult in consequence of the crowds of heroes<br>that will hurry along it for reaching that blessed goal. Remembering with<br>gratitude the feats of those heroes that have died for me, I desire to<br>pay off the debt I owe them, instead of fixing my heart upon kingdom. If,<br>having caused my friends and brothers and grandsires to be slain, I save<br>my own life, the world will without doubt, censure me. What kind of<br>sovereignty will that be which I will enjoy, destitute of kinsmen and<br>friends and well-wishers, and bowing down unto the son of Pandu? I, who<br>have lorded it over the universe in that way, will now acquire heaven by<br>fair fight. It will not be otherwise." Thus addressed by Duryodhana, all<br>the Kshatriyas there applauded that speech and cheered the king, saying,<br>"Excellent, Excellent." Without at all grieving for their defeat, and<br>firmly resolved upon displaying their prowess, all of them, being<br>determined to fight, became filled with enthusiasm. Having groomed their<br>animals, the Kauravas, delighting at the prospect of battle, took up<br>their quarters (for the night) at a spot a little less than two Yojanas<br>distant from the field. Having reached the Sarasvati of red waters on the<br>sacred and beautiful table-land at the foot of Himavat, they bathed in<br>that water and quenched their thirst with it. Their spirits raised by thy<br>son, they continued to wait (on their resting ground). Once more rallying<br>their own selves as well as one another, all those Kshatriyas, O king,<br>urged by fate, waited (in their encampment).'"
