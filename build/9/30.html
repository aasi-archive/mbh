                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'After all the Kaurava troops had been slain by the<br>sons of Pandu on the field of battle, what did those survivors of my<br>army, Kritavarma and Kripa and the valiant son of Drona do? What also did<br>the wicked-souled king Duryodhana then do?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'After the flight of the ladies of those high-souled<br>Kshatriyas, and after the (Kaurava) camp had become entirely empty, the<br>three car-warriors (thou hast mentioned) became filled with anxiety.<br>Hearing the shouts of the victorious sons of Pandu, and beholding the<br>camp deserted towards the evening, those three warriors of our side,<br>desirous of rescuing the king, and unable to stay on the field, proceeded<br>towards the lake. Yudhishthira, of virtuous soul, with his brothers in<br>that battle, felt great joy and wandered over the field from desire of<br>staying Duryodhana. Filled with wrath, the Pandavas, desirous of victory,<br>searched for thy son. Though, however, they looked very carefully for<br>him, they failed to discover the (Kuru) king. Mace in hand, he had fled<br>with great speed from the field of battle and penetrated into that lake,<br>having by the aid of his powers of illusion, solidified its waters. When<br>at last the animals of the Pandavas became very much tired, the latter<br>proceeded to their camp and rested there with their soldiers. After the<br>Parthas had retired to their camp, Kripa and Drona's son and Kritavarma<br>of the Satwata race, slowly proceeded towards that lake. Approaching the<br>lake within which lay the king, they addressed that invincible ruler of<br>men asleep within the water, saying, "Arise, O king, and fight with us<br>against Yudhishthira! Either obtaining victory enjoy the earth, or,<br>slain, proceed to heaven! The forces of the Pandavas also, O Duryodhana,<br>have all been slain by thee! Those amongst them that are yet alive have<br>been exceedingly mangled! They will not be able, O monarch, to bear thy<br>impetuosity, especially when thou shalt be protected by us! Arise,<br>therefore, O Bharata!"<br><br>"'Duryodhana said, "By good luck, I see you, ye bulls among men, come<br>back with life from this destructive battle between the Pandavas and the<br>Kauravas! After we have rested a while and dispelled our fatigue, we<br>shall encounter the enemy and conquer him! Ye also are tired and I myself<br>am exceedingly mangled! The army of the Pandavas is swelling with might!<br>For these reasons, I do not like to fight now! These exhortations on your<br>part, ye heroes, are not at all wonderful, for your hearts are noble!<br>Your devotion also to me is great! This, however, is not the time for<br>prowess! Resting for this one night, I shall, on the morrow, join you and<br>fight with the foe! In this there is no doubt!"'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed, the son of Drona replied unto the<br>king, who was invincible in battle, saying, "Arise, O king, blessed be<br>thou, we shall yet vanquish the foe! I swear by all my religious acts, by<br>all the gifts I have made, by truth itself, and my silent meditations, O<br>king, that I shall today slay the Somakas! Let me not obtain the delight<br>resulting from the performance of sacrifices, that delight which is felt<br>by all pious men, if this night passes away without my slaying the<br>Pandavas in battle! Without slaying all the Pancalas, I will not, O lord,<br>put off my armour! I tell thee this truly. Believe me, O ruler of men!"<br>While they were thus conversing, a number of hunters came there. Fatigued<br>with the weight of meat they carried, they came there, not of any set<br>purpose, for slaking their thirst. Those huntsmen, O lord, used every<br>day, to procure, with great regard, a basketful of meat for Bhimasena, O<br>king! As they sat concealed on the banks of that lake, those men heard<br>every word of that conversation between Duryodhana and those warriors.<br>Finding the Kuru king unwilling to fight, those great bowmen, themselves<br>desirous of battle, began to urge him greatly to adopt their counsels.<br>Seeing those car-warriors of the Kaurava army, and understanding that the<br>king, unwilling to fight, was staying within the waters, and hearing that<br>conversation between those heroes and their master staying within the<br>depths of the lake, indeed, O monarch, the huntsmen, clearly perceiving<br>that it was Duryodhana who was staying within the lake, formed a<br>resolution. A little while before, the son of Pandu, while searching for<br>the king, had met those men and asked them about the whereabouts of<br>Duryodhana. Recollecting the words that the son of Pandu had said, those<br>hunters, O king, whisperingly said unto one another, "We will discover<br>Duryodhana (unto the Pandavas). The son of Pandu will then give us<br>wealth! It is evident to us that the celebrated king Duryodhana is here!<br>Let us then, all of us, proceed to the spot where king Yudhishthira is,<br>for telling him that the vindictive Duryodhana is concealed within the<br>waters of this lake! Let us also, all of us, inform that great bowman,<br>the intelligent Bhimasena, that the son of Dhritarashtra is concealed<br>here within the waters of this lake! Gratified with us, he will give us<br>much wealth! What need of fatiguing ourselves, day after day, with<br>procuring meat and weakening ourselves with such toil?" Having said these<br>words, those huntsmen, filled with joy and longing for wealth, took up<br>their baskets of meat and proceeded towards the (Pandava) camp. Possessed<br>of sure aim and skilled in smiting, the Pandavas, O monarch, not seeing<br>in battle Duryodhana, who was then concealed, (were resting in their<br>camp). Desirous of reaching the end of that sinful wight's evil policy,<br>they had despatched spies in all directions on the field of battle. All<br>the soldiers, however, that had been despatched on that mission returned<br>to the camp together and informed king Yudhishthira the just that no<br>trace could be found of king Duryodhana. Hearing these words of the<br>returned messengers, O bull of Bharata's race, king Yudhishthira became<br>filled with great anxiety and began to breathe heavily. While the<br>Pandavas, O bull of Bharata's race, were staying in such cheerlessness,<br>those huntsmen, O lord, having come with great speed from the banks of<br>that lake, arrived at the camp, filled with joy at having discovered<br>Duryodhana. Though forbidden, they still entered the camp, in the very<br>sight of Bhimasena. Having approached that mighty son of Pandu,<br>Bhimasena, they represented everything unto him about what they had seen<br>and heard. Then Vrikodara, that scorcher of foes, O king, giving them<br>much wealth, represented everything unto king Yudhishthira the just,<br>saying, "Duryodhana, O king, hath been discovered by the huntsmen that<br>supply me with meat! He, O king, for whom thou grievest now lies within a<br>lake whose waters have been solidified by him!' Hearing these agreeable<br>words of Bhimasena, O monarch, Kunti's son, Ajatasatru, became, with all<br>his brothers, filled with joy. Having learnt that the mighty bowman<br>Duryodhana had penetrated into the waters of a lake, the king proceeded<br>thither with great speed, with Janardana at his head. Then a tumultuous<br>noise arose, O monarch, from among the Pandavas and the Pancalas all of<br>whom were filled with joy. The warriors uttered leonine roars, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, and shouted loudly. All the Kshatriyas, O king, proceeded<br>with great speed towards that lake called Dvaipayana. The rejoicing<br>Somakas all around loudly and repeatedly exclaimed, "The sinful son of<br>Dhritarashtra has been found!" The noise made by the cars of those<br>impetuous warriors who proceeded with great speed, became very loud, O<br>monarch, and touched the heavens. Although their animals were tired, all<br>of them still proceeded with speed behind king Yudhishthira who was bent<br>upon finding out Duryodhana. Arjuna, and Bhimasena, and the two sons of<br>Madri by Pandu, and the Pancala prince Dhrishtadyumna, and the<br>unvanquished Shikhandi, and Uttamaujas, and Yudhamanyu, and the mighty<br>car-warrior Satyaki, and the (five) sons of Draupadi, and those amongst<br>the Pancalas, O king, that were yet alive, and all the Pandavas, and all<br>their elephants, and foot-soldiers by hundreds upon hundreds, all<br>proceeded with Yudhishthira. Possessed of great valour, king Yudhishthira<br>the just, O monarch, arrived at the lake known by the name of Dvaipayana<br>within which Duryodhana then was. Wide as the ocean itself, its aspect<br>was agreeable and its waters were cool and transparent. Solidifying the<br>waters by means of his power of illusion, by, indeed, a wonderful method,<br>thy son Duryodhana, O Bharata, happened to be within that lake. Indeed,<br>within those waters lay, O lord, that king, armed with his mace, who, O<br>ruler of men, could not be vanquished by any man! Staying within the<br>waters of that lake, king Duryodhana heard that tumultuous noise (of the<br>Pandava army) which resembled the very roar of the clouds. Yudhishthira<br>then, O king, with his brothers repaired to that lake from desire of<br>slaying Duryodhana. Raising a thick dust, the son of Pandu caused the<br>earth to tremble with the sound of his car-wheels and the loud blare of<br>his conch. Hearing the noise made by the army of Yudhishthira, those<br>great car-warriors, Kritavarma and Kripa and the son of Drona, said these<br>words unto the Kuru king, "Filled with joy and longing for victory, the<br>Pandavas are coming hither! We will, therefore, leave this place. Let it<br>be known to thee!" Hearing those words of these heroes endued with great<br>activity, he answered them, saying, "So be it," and remained (as before)<br>within the waters, having, O lord, solidified them by his powers of<br>illusion. Those car-warriors headed by Kripa, filled with grief, took<br>leave of the king, O monarch, and went away to a place far removed from<br>that spot. Having proceeded far, they beheld a banyan, O sire, under<br>whose shade they stopped, greatly tired, and exceedingly anxious about<br>the king and indulging in such thoughts as these, "The mighty son of<br>Dhritarashtra, having solidified the waters of the lake, lay stretched at<br>the bottom. The Pandavas have reached that spot, from desire of battle.<br>How will the battle take place? What will become of the king?' Thinking<br>of these things, O king, those heroes, Kripa and the others, liberated<br>their horses from their cars and prepared to rest there for some time.'"
