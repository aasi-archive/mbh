                            "Sanjaya said, 'During the progress of that terrible and awful battle,<br>the army of thy son was broken by the Pandavas. Rallying their great<br>car-warriors, however, with vigorous efforts, thy sons continued to fight<br>with the Pandava army. The (Kuru) warriors, desirous of thy son's<br>welfare, suddenly returned. Upon their return, the battle once more<br>became exceedingly fierce between thy warriors and those of the foe,<br>resembling that between the gods and the Asuras in days of old. Neither<br>amongst the enemies nor amongst thine was there a single combatant that<br>turned away from that battle. The warriors fought, aided by guess and by<br>the names they uttered. Great was the destruction that occurred as they<br>thus fought with one another. Then king Yudhishthira, filled with great<br>wrath and becoming desirous of vanquishing the Dhartarashtras and their<br>king in that battle, pierced the son of Saradwat with three arrows winged<br>with gold and whetted on stone, and next slew with four others the four<br>steeds of Kritavarma. Then Ashvatthama bore away the celebrated son of<br>Hridika. Saradwat's son pierced Yudhishthira in return with eight arrows.<br>Then king Duryodhana despatched seven hundred cars to the spot where king<br>Yudhishthira was battling. Those cars ridden by excellent warriors and<br>endued with speed of the wind or thought, rushed in that battle against<br>the car of Kunti's son. Encompassing Yudhishthira on every side, they<br>made him invisible with their shafts like clouds hiding the sun from the<br>view. Then the Pandava heroes headed by Shikhandi, beholding king<br>Yudhishthira the just assailed in that way by the Kauravas, became filled<br>with rage and were unable to put up with it. Desirous of rescuing<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, they came to that spot upon their cars<br>possessed of great speed and adorned with rows of bells. Then commenced<br>an awful battle, in which blood flowed as water, between the Pandavas and<br>the Kurus, that increased the population of Yama's domains. Slaying those<br>seven hundred hostile car-warriors of the Kuru army, the Pandavas and the<br>Pancalas once more resisted (the whole Kuru army). There a fierce battle<br>was fought between thy son and the Pandavas. We had never before seen or<br>heard of its like. During the progress of that battle in which no<br>consideration was showed by anybody for anybody, and while the warriors<br>of thy army and those of the foe were falling fast, and the combatants<br>were all shouting and blowing their conchs, and the bowmen were roaring<br>and uttering loud noises of diverse kinds, while, indeed, the battle was<br>raging fiercely and the very vitals of the combatants were being struck,<br>and the troops, O sire, desirous of victory, were rushing with speed,<br>while, verily, everything on Earth seemed to be undergoing a woeful<br>destruction, during that time when innumerable ladies of birth and beauty<br>were being made widows, during, indeed, the progress of that fierce<br>engagement in which the warriors behaved without any consideration for<br>friends and foes, awful portents appeared, presaging the destruction of<br>everything. The Earth, with her mountains and forests, trembled, making a<br>loud noise. Meteors like blazing brands equipped with handles dropped<br>from the sky, O king, on every side on the Earth as if from the solar<br>disc. A hurricane arose, blowing on all sides, and bearing away hard<br>pebbles along its lower course. The elephants shed copious tears and<br>trembled exceedingly. Disregarding all these fierce and awful portents,<br>the Kshatriyas, taking counsel with one another, cheerfully stood on the<br>field for battle again, on the beautiful and sacred field called after<br>Kuru, desirous of obtaining heaven. Then Shakuni, the son of the Gandhara<br>king, said, "Fight all of ye in front! I, however, will slay the Pandavas<br>from behind." Then the Madraka warriors, endued with great activity,<br>amongst those on our side that were advancing, became filled with joy and<br>uttered diverse sounds of delight. Others too did the same. The<br>invincible Pandavas, however, possessed of sureness of aim, once more<br>coming against us, shook their bows and covered us with showers of<br>arrows. The forces of the Madrakas then were slain by the foe. Beholding<br>this, the troops of Duryodhana once more turned away from the battle. The<br>mighty king of the Gandharvas, however, once more said these words,<br>"Stop, ye sinful ones! Fight (with the foe)! What use is there of<br>flight?" At that time, O bull of Bharata's race, the king of the<br>Gandharas had full 10,000 horse-men capable of fighting with bright<br>lances. During the progress of that great carnage, Shakuni, aided by that<br>force, put forth his valour and assailed the Pandava army at the rear,<br>slaughtering it with his keen shafts. The vast force of the Pandus then,<br>O monarch, broke even as a mass of clouds is dispersed on all sides by a<br>mighty wind. Then Yudhishthira, beholding from a near point his own army<br>routed, coolly urged the mighty Sahadeva, saying, "Yonder the son of<br>Subala, afflicting our rear, stayeth, clad in mail! He slaughtereth our<br>forces! Behold that wicked wight, O son of Pandu! Aided by the son of<br>Draupadi, proceed towards him and slay Shakuni, the son of Subala!<br>Supported by the Pancalas, O sinless one, I will meanwhile destroy the<br>car force of the enemy! Let all the elephants and all the horse and 3,000<br>foot, proceed with thee! Supported by these, slay Shakuni!" At this, 700<br>elephants ridden by combatants armed with the bow, and 5,000 horses, and<br>the valiant Sahadeva, and 3,000 foot-soldiers, and the sons of Draupadi<br>all rushed against Shakuni difficult of defeat in battle. Subala's son,<br>however, of great valour, O king, prevailing over the Pandavas and<br>longing for victory, began to slay their forces from the rear. The<br>horsemen, infuriate with rage, belonging to the Pandavas endued with<br>great activity, penetrated the division of Subala's son, prevailing over<br>the latter's car-warriors. Those heroic horsemen, staying in the midst of<br>their own elephants, covered the large host of Subala's son with showers<br>of shafts. In consequence of thy evil counsels, O king, dreadful was the<br>battle that then ensued in which maces and lances were used and in which<br>heroes only took part. The twang of bow-string was no longer heard there,<br>for all the car-warriors stood as spectators of that fight. At that time<br>no difference could be seen between the contending parties. Both the<br>Kurus and the Pandavas, O bull of Bharata's race, beheld the darts hurled<br>from heroic arms course like meteors through the welkin. The entire<br>welkin, O monarch, shrouded with falling swords of great brightness,<br>seemed to become exceedingly beautiful. The aspect presented, O chief of<br>the Bharatas, by the lances hurled all around, became like that of swarms<br>of locusts in the welkin. Steeds, with limbs bathed in blood in<br>consequence of wounds inflicted by horsemen themselves wounded with<br>arrows, dropped down on all sides in hundreds and thousands. Encountering<br>one another and huddled together, many of them were seen to be mangled<br>and many to vomit blood from their mouths. A thick darkness came there<br>when the troops were covered with a dusty cloud. When that darkness<br>shrouded everything, O king, we beheld those brave combatants, steeds and<br>men, move away from that spot. Others were seen to fall down on the<br>Earth, vomiting blood in profusion. Many combatants, entangled with one<br>another by their locks, could not stir. Many, endued with great strength,<br>dragged one another from the backs of their horses, and encountering one<br>another thus, slew one another like combatants in a wrestling match. Many<br>deprived of life, were borne away on the backs of the steeds. Many men,<br>proud of their valour and inspired with desire of victory, were seen to<br>fall down on the Earth. The Earth became strewn over with hundreds and<br>thousands of combatants bathed in blood, deprived of limbs, and divested<br>of hair. In consequence of the surface of the Earth being covered with<br>elephant-riders and horsemen and slain steeds and combatants with<br>blood-stained armour and others armed with weapons and others who had<br>sought to slay one another with diverse kinds of terrible weapons, all<br>lying closely huddled together in that battle fraught with fearful<br>carnage, no warrior could proceed far on his horse. Having fought for a<br>little while, Shakuni, the son of Subala, O monarch, went away from that<br>spot with the remnant of his cavalry numbering 6,000. Similarly, the<br>Pandava force, covered with blood, and its animals fatigued, moved away<br>from that spot with its remnant consisting of 6,000 horses. The<br>blood-stained horsemen of the Pandava army then, with hearts intent on<br>battle and prepared to lay down their lives, said, "It is no longer<br>possible to fight here on cars; how much more difficult then to fight<br>here on elephants! Let cars proceed against cars, and elephants against<br>elephants! Having retreated, Shakuni is now within his own division. The<br>royal son of Subala will not again come to battle." Then the sons of<br>Draupadi and those infuriate elephants proceeded to the place where the<br>Pancala prince Dhrishtadyumna, that great car-warrior, was. Sahadeva<br>also, when that dusty cloud arose, proceeded alone to where king<br>Yudhishthira was. After all those had gone away, Shakuni, the son of<br>Subala, excited with wrath, once more fell upon Dhrishtadyumna's division<br>and began to strike it. Once more a dreadful battle took place, in which<br>the combatants were all regardless of their lives, between thy soldiers<br>and those of the foe, all of whom were desirous of slaying one another.<br>In that encounter of heroes, the combatants first eyed one another<br>steadfastly, and then rushed, O king, and fell upon one another in<br>hundreds and thousands. In that destructive carnage, heads severed with<br>swords fell down with a noise like that of falling palmyra fruits. Loud<br>also became the noise, making the very hair to stand on end, of bodies<br>falling down on the ground, divested of armour and mangled with weapons<br>and of falling weapons also, O king, and of arms and thighs severed from<br>the trunk. Striking brothers and sons and even sires with keen weapons,<br>the combatants were seen to fight like birds, for pieces of meat. Excited<br>with rage, thousands of warriors, falling upon one another, impatiently<br>struck one another in that battle. Hundreds and thousands of combatants,<br>killed by the weight of slain horsemen while falling down from their<br>steeds, fell down on the field. Loud became the noise of neighing steeds<br>of great fleetness, and of shouting men clad in mail, and of the falling<br>darts and swords, O king, of combatants desirous of piercing the vitals<br>of one another in consequence, O monarch, of thy evil policy. At that<br>time, thy soldiers, overcome with toil, spent with rage, their animals<br>fatigued, themselves parched with thirst mangled with keen weapons, began<br>to turn away from the battle. Maddened with the scent of blood, many<br>became so insensate that they slew friends and foes alike, in fact, every<br>one they got at. Large numbers of Kshatriyas, inspired with desire of<br>victory, were struck down with arrows, O king, and fell prostrate on the<br>Earth. Wolves and vultures and jackals began to howl and scream in glee<br>and make a loud noise. In the very sight of thy son, thy army suffered a<br>great loss. The Earth, O monarch, became strewn with the bodies of men<br>and steeds, and covered with streams of blood that inspired the timid<br>with terror. Struck and mangled repeatedly with swords and battle axes<br>and lances, thy warriors, as also the Pandavas, O Bharata, ceased to<br>approach one another. Striking one another according to the measure of<br>their strength, and fighting to the last drop of their blood, the<br>combatants fell down vomiting blood from their wounds. Headless forms<br>were seen, seizing the hair of their heads (with one hand) and with<br>uplifted swords dyed with blood (in the other). When many headless forms,<br>O king, had thus risen up, when the scent of blood had made the<br>combatants nearly senseless, and when the loud noise had somewhat<br>subsided, Subala's son (once more) approached the large host of the<br>Pandavas, with the small remnant of his horse. At this, the Pandavas,<br>inspired with desires of victory and endued with foot-soldiers and<br>elephants and cavalry, all with uplifted weapons, desirous of reaching<br>the end of the hostilities, the Pandavas, forming a wall, encompassed<br>Shakuni on all sides, and began to strike him with diverse kinds of<br>weapons. Beholding those troops of thine assailed from every side, the<br>Kauravas, with horsemen, foot-soldiers, elephants, and cars, rushed<br>towards the Pandavas. Some foot-soldiers of great courage, destitute of<br>weapons, attacked their foes in that battle, with feet and fists, and<br>brought them down. Car-warriors fell down from cars, and elephant-men<br>from elephants, like meritorious persons falling down from their<br>celestial vehicles upon the exhaustion of their merits. Thus the<br>combatants, engaged with one another in that great battle, slew sires and<br>friends and sons. Thus occurred that battle, O best of the Bharatas, in<br>which no consideration was shown by anybody for anyone, and in which<br>lances and swords and arrows fell fast, on every side and made the scene<br>exceedingly terrible to behold.'"
