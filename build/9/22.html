                            "Sanjaya said, 'That foremost of car-warriors, O monarch, thy son, riding<br>on his car and filled with the courage of despair, looked resplendent in<br>that battle like Rudra himself of great valour. With the thousands of<br>shafts shot by him, the Earth became completely covered. Indeed, he<br>drenched his enemies with showers of arrows like the clouds pouring rain<br>on mountain breasts. There was then not a man amongst the Pandavas in<br>that great battle, or a steed, or an elephant, or a car, that was not<br>struck with Duryodhana's arrows. Upon whomsoever amongst the warriors I<br>then cast my eyes, O monarch, I beheld that every one, O Bharata, was<br>struck by thy son with his arrows. The Pandava army was then covered with<br>the shafts of that illustrious warrior, even as a host is covered with<br>the dust it raises while marching or rushing to battle. The Earth then, O<br>lord of Earth, seemed to me to be made one entire expanse of arrows by<br>thy son Duryodhana, that bowman possessed of great lightness of hands.<br>Amongst those thousands upon thousands of warriors on the field,<br>belonging to thy side or that of the enemy, it seemed to me that<br>Duryodhana was then the only man. The prowess that we then beheld of thy<br>son seemed to be exceedingly wonderful, since the Parthas, even uniting<br>together, could not approach his single self. He pierced Yudhishthira, O<br>bull of Bharata's race, with a hundred arrows, and Bhimasena with<br>seventy, and Sahadeva with seven. And he pierced Nakula with four and<br>sixty, and Dhrishtadyumna with five, and the sons of Draupadi with seven,<br>and Satyaki with three arrows. With a broad-headed arrow, he then, O<br>sire, cut off the bow of Sahadeva. Laying aside that broken bow, the<br>valiant son of Madri, took up another formidable bow, and rushing against<br>king Duryodhana, pierced him with ten shafts in that battle. The great<br>bowman Nakula, possessed of courage, then pierced the king with nine<br>terrible arrows and uttered a loud roar. Satyaki struck the king with a<br>single straight shaft; the sons of Draupadi struck him with three and<br>seventy and king Yudhishthira struck him with five. And Bhimasena<br>afflicted the king with eighty shafts. Though pierced thus from every<br>side with numerous arrows by these illustrious warriors, Duryodhana<br>still, O monarch, did not waver, in the presence of all the troops who<br>stood there as spectators. The quickness, the skill, and the prowess of<br>that illustrious warrior were seen by all the men there to exceed those<br>of every creature. Meanwhile the Dhartarashtras, O monarch, who had not<br>fled far from that spot, beholding the king, rallied and returned there,<br>clad in mail. The noise made by them when they came back became<br>exceedingly awful, like the roar of the surging ocean in the season of<br>rains. Approaching their unvanquished king in that battle, those great<br>bowmen proceeded against the Pandavas for fight. The son of Drona<br>resisted in that battle the angry Bhimasena. With the arrows, O monarch,<br>that were shot in that battle, all the points of the compass became<br>completely shrouded, so that the brave combatants could not distinguish<br>the cardinal from the subsidiary points of the compass. As regards<br>Ashvatthama and Bhimasena, O Bharata, both of them were achievers of<br>cruel feats. Both of them were irresistible in battle. The arms of both<br>contained many cicatrices in consequence of both having repeatedly drawn<br>the bow-string. Counteracting each other's feats, they continued to fight<br>with each other, frightening the whole Universe. The heroic Shakuni<br>assailed Yudhishthira in that battle. The mighty son of Subala, having<br>slain the four steeds of the king, uttered a loud roar, causing all the<br>troops to tremble with fear. Meanwhile, the valiant Sahadeva bore away<br>the heroic and vanquished king on his car from that battle. Then king<br>Yudhishthira the just, riding upon another car (came back to battle), and<br>having pierced Shakuni at first with nine arrows, once more pierced him<br>with five. And that foremost of all bowmen then uttered a loud roar. That<br>battle, O sire, awful as it was, became wonderful to behold. It filled<br>the spectators with delight and was applauded by the Siddhas and the<br>Charanas. Uluka of immeasurable soul rushed against the mighty bowman<br>Nakula, in that battle, shooting showers of arrows from every side. The<br>heroic Nakula, however, in that battle, resisted the son of Shakuni with<br>a thick shower of arrows from every side. Both those heroes were<br>well-born and both were mighty car-warriors. They were seen to fight with<br>each other, each highly enraged with the other. Similarly Kritavarma, O<br>king, fighting with the grandson of Sini, that scorcher of foes, looked<br>resplendent, like Shakra battling with the Asura Vala. Duryodhana, having<br>cut off Dhrishtadyumna's bow in that battle, pierced his bowless<br>antagonist with keen shafts. Dhrishtadyumna then, in that encounter,<br>having taken up a formidable bow, fought with the king in the sight of<br>all the bowmen. The battle between those two heroes became exceedingly<br>fierce, O bull of Bharata's race, like the encounter between two wild and<br>infuriate elephants with juicy secretions trickling down their limbs. The<br>heroic Gautama, excited with rage in that battle, pierced the mighty sons<br>of Draupadi with many straight shafts. The battle that took place between<br>him and those five, resembled that which takes place between an embodied<br>being and his (five) senses. It was awful and exceedingly fierce, and<br>neither side showed any consideration for the other. The (five) sons of<br>Draupadi afflicted Kripa like the (five) senses afflicting a foolish man.<br>He, on the other hand, fighting with them, controlled them with vigour.<br>Even such and so wonderful, O Bharata, was that battle between him and<br>them. It resembled the repeated combats, O lord, between embodied<br>creatures and their senses. Men fought with men, elephants with<br>elephants, steeds with steeds and car-warriors with car-warriors. Once<br>more, O monarch, that battle became general and awful. Here an encounter<br>was beautiful, there another was awful, and there another was exceedingly<br>fierce, O lord! Many and awful, O monarch, were the encounters that took<br>place in course of that battle. Those chastisers of foes (belonging to<br>both armies), encountering one another, pierced and slew one another in<br>that dreadful engagement. A dense cloud of dust was then seen there,<br>raised by the vehicles and the animals of the warriors. Thick also, O<br>king, was the dust raised by the running steeds, a dust that was carried<br>from one place to another by the wind. Raised by the wheels of cars and<br>the breaths of the elephants, the dust, thick as an evening cloud, rose<br>into the welkin. That dust having been raised and the sun himself having<br>been dimmed therewith, the Earth became shrouded, and the heroic and<br>mighty car-warriors could not be seen. Anon that disappeared and<br>everything became clear when the Earth, O best of the Bharatas, became<br>drenched with the blood of heroes. Indeed, that dense and awful cloud of<br>dust was allayed. Then, O Bharata, I could once more see the diverse<br>single combats that the combatants fought at noon of day, each according<br>to his strength and his rank, all of which were exceedingly fierce. The<br>blazing splendour of those feats, O monarch, appeared full in view. Loud<br>became the noise of falling shafts in that battle, resembling that made<br>by a vast forest of bamboo while burning on every side.'"
