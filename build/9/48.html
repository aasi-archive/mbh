                            Vaishampayana said, "Rama (as already said) then proceeded to the tirtha<br>called Vadarapachana where dwelt many ascetics and Siddhas. There the<br>daughter of Bharadwaja, unrivalled on earth for beauty, named Sruvavati,<br>practised severe austerities. She was a maiden who led the life of a<br>Brahmacharini. That beautiful damsel, observing diverse kinds of vows,<br>practised the austerest of penances, moved by the desire of obtaining the<br>Lord of the celestials for her husband. Many years passed away, O<br>perpetuator of Kuru's race, during which that damsel continually observed<br>those diverse vows exceedingly difficult of being practised by women. The<br>adorable chastiser of Paka at last became gratified with her in<br>consequence of that conduct and those penances of hers and that high<br>regard she showed for him. The puissant Lord of the celestials then came<br>to that hermitage, having assumed the form of the high-souled and<br>regenerate Rishi Vasishtha. Beholding that foremost of ascetics,<br>Vasishtha, of the austerest penances, she worshipped him, O Bharata<br>according to the rites observed by ascetics. Conversant with vows, the<br>auspicious and sweet-speeched damsel addressed him, saying, 'O adorable<br>one, O tiger among ascetics, tell me thy commands, O lord! O thou of<br>excellent vows, I shall serve thee according to the measure of my might!<br>I will not, however, give thee my hand, in consequence of my regard for<br>Shakra! I am seeking to please Shakra, the lord of the three worlds, with<br>vows and rigid observances and ascetic penances!' Thus addressed by her,<br>the illustrious god, smiling as he cast his eyes on her, and knowing her<br>observances, addressed her sweetly, O Bharata, saying, 'Thou practisest<br>penances of the austerest kind! This is known to me, O thou of excellent<br>vows! That object also, cherished in thy heart, for the attainment of<br>which thou strivest, O auspicious one, shall, O thou of beautiful face,<br>be accomplished for thee! Everything is attainable by penances.<br>Everything rests on penances. All those regions of blessedness, O thou of<br>beautiful face, that belong to the gods can be obtained by penances.<br>Penances are the root of great happiness. Those men that cast off their<br>bodies after having practised austere penances, obtain the status of<br>gods, O auspicious one! Bear in mind these words of mine! Do thou now, O<br>blessed damsel, boil these five jujubes, O thou of excellent vows!'<br>Having said these words, the adorable slayer of Vala went away, taking<br>leave, to mentally recite certain mantras at an excellent tirtha not far<br>from that hermitage. That tirtha came to be known in the three worlds<br>after the name of Indra, O giver of honours! Indeed, it was for the<br>purpose of testing the damsel's devotion that the Lord of the celestials<br>acted in that way for obstructing the boiling of the jujubes. The damsel,<br>O king, having cleansed herself, began her task; restraining speech and<br>with attention fixed on it, she sat to her task without feeling any<br>fatigue. Even thus that damsel of high vows, O tiger among kings, began<br>to boil those jujubes. As she sat employed in her task, O bull among men,<br>day was about to wane, but yet those jujubes showed no signs of having<br>been softened. The fuel she had there was all consumed. Seeing the fire<br>about to die away owing to want of fuel, she began to burn her own limbs.<br>The beautiful maiden first thrust her feet into the fire. The sinless<br>damsel sat still while her feet began to be consumed. The faultless girl<br>did not at all mind her burning feet. Difficult of accomplishment, she<br>did it from desire of doing good to the Rishi (that had been her guest).<br>Her face did not at all change under that painful process, nor did she<br>feel any cheerlessness on that account. Having thrust her limbs into the<br>fire, she felt as much joy as if she had dipped them into cool water. The<br>words of the Rishi, 'Cook these jujubes well' were borne in her mind, O<br>Bharata! The auspicious damsel, bearing those words of the great Rishi in<br>her mind, began to cook those jujubes although the latter, O king, showed<br>no signs of softening. The adorable Agni himself consumed her feet. For<br>this, however, the maiden did not feel the slightest pain. Beholding this<br>act of hers, the Lord of the three worlds became highly satisfied. He<br>then showed himself in his own proper form to the damsel. The chief of<br>the celestials then addressed that maiden of very austere vows saying, 'I<br>am pleased at thy devotion, thy penances, and thy vows! The wish,<br>therefore, O auspicious one, that thou cherishest shall be accomplished!<br>Casting off thy body, O blessed one, thou shalt in heaven live with me!<br>This hermitage, again, shall become the foremost of tirthas in the world,<br>capable of cleansing from every sin, O thou of fair eye-brows, and shall<br>be known by the name of Vadarapachana. It shall be celebrated in the<br>three worlds and shall be praised by great Rishis. In this very tirtha, O<br>auspicious, sinless, and highly blessed one, the seven Rishis had, on one<br>occasion, left Arundhati, (the wife of one of them), when they went to<br>Himavat. Those highly blessed ones of very rigid vows, had gone there for<br>gathering fruits and roots for their sustenance. While they thus lived in<br>a forest of Himavat for procuring their sustenance, a drought occurred<br>extending for twelve years. Those ascetics, having made an asylum for<br>themselves, continued to live there. Meanwhile Arundhati devoted herself<br>to ascetic penances (at the spot where she had been left). Beholding<br>Arundhati devoted to the austerest of vows, the boon-giving and<br>three-eyed deity (Mahadeva) highly pleased, came there. The great<br>Mahadeva, assuming the form of a Brahmana, came to her and said, 'I<br>desire alms, O auspicious one!' The beautiful Arundhati said unto him,<br>'Our store of food hath been exhausted, O Brahmana! Do thou eat jujubes!'<br>Mahadeva replied, 'Cook these jujubes, O thou of excellent vows!' After<br>these words, she began to cook those jujubes for doing what was agreeable<br>to that Brahmana. Placing those jujubes on the fire, the celebrated<br>Arundhati listened to diverse excellent and charming and sacred<br>discourses (from the lips of Mahadeva). That twelve years' drought then<br>passed away (as if it were a single day). Without food, and employed in<br>cooking and listening to those auspicious discourses, that terrible<br>period passed away, as if it were a single day to her. Then the seven<br>Rishis, having procured fruits from the mountain, returned to that spot.<br>The adorable Mahadeva, highly pleased with Arundhati, said unto her,<br>'Approach, as formerly, these Rishis, O righteous one! I have been<br>gratified with thy penances and vows!' The adorable Hara then stood<br>confessed in his own form. Gratified, he spoke unto them about the noble<br>conduct of Arundhati (in these words) 'The ascetic merit, ye regenerate<br>ones, that this lady hath earned, is, I think, much greater than what ye<br>have earned on the breast of Himavat! The penances practised by this lady<br>have been exceedingly austere, for she passed twelve years in cooking,<br>herself fasting all the while!' The divine Mahadeva then, addressing<br>Arundhati, said unto her, 'Solicit thou the boon, O auspicious dame,<br>which is in thy heart!' Then that lady of large eyes that were of a<br>reddish hue addressed that god in the midst of the seven Rishis, saying,<br>'If, O divine one thou art gratified with me, then let this spot be an<br>excellent tirtha! Let it be known by the name of Vadarapachana and let it<br>be the favourite resort of Siddhas and celestial Rishis. So also, O god<br>of gods, let him who observes a fast here and resides for three nights<br>after having cleansed himself, obtain the fruit of a twelve years' fast!'<br>The god answered her, saying, 'Let it be so!' Praised by the seven<br>Rishis, the god then repaired to heaven. Indeed the Rishis had been<br>filled with wonder at the sight of the god and upon beholding the chaste<br>Arundhati herself unspent and still possessed of the hue of health and so<br>capable of bearing hunger and thirst. Even thus the pure-souled<br>Arundhati, in days of old, obtained the highest success, like thee, O<br>highly blessed lady, for my sake, O damsel of rigid vows! Thou, however,<br>O amiable maiden, hast practised severer penances! Gratified with thy<br>vows, I shall also grant thee this special boon, O auspicious one, a boon<br>that is superior to what was granted to Arundhati. Through the power of<br>the high-souled god who had granted that boon to Arundhati and through<br>the energy of thyself, O amiable one, I shall duly grant thee another<br>boon now, that the person who will reside in this tirtha for only one<br>night and bathe here with soul fixed (on meditation), will, after casting<br>off his body obtain many regions of blessedness that are difficult of<br>acquisition (by other means)! Having said these words unto the cleansed<br>Sruvavati, the thousand-eyed Shakra of great energy then went back to<br>heaven. After the wielder of the thunderbolt, O king, had departed, a<br>shower of celestial flowers of sweet fragrance fell there, O chief of<br>Bharata's race! Celestial kettle-drums also, of loud sound, were beaten<br>there. Auspicious and perfumed breezes also blew there, O monarch! The<br>auspicious Sruvavati then, casting off her body, became the spouse of<br>Indra. Obtaining the status through austere penances, she began to pass<br>her time, sporting with him for ever and ever."<br><br>Janamejaya said, "Who was the mother of Sruvavati, and how was that fair<br>damsel reared? I desire to hear this, O Brahmana, for the curiosity I<br>feel is great."<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "The vital seed of the regenerate and high-souled<br>Rishi Bharadwaja fell, upon beholding the large-eyed Apsara Ghritachi as<br>the latter was passing at one time. That foremost of ascetics thereupon<br>held it in his hand. It was then kept in a cup made of the leaves of a<br>tree. In that cup was born the girl Sruvavati. Having performed the usual<br>post-genital rites, the great ascetic Bharadwaja, endued with wealth of<br>penances, gave her a name. The name the righteous-souled Rishi gave her<br>in the presence of the gods and Rishis was Sruvavati. Keeping the girl in<br>his hermitage, Bharadwaja repaired to the forests of Himavat. That<br>foremost one among the Yadus, Baladeva of great dignity, having bathed in<br>that tirtha and given away much wealth unto many foremost of Brahmanas,<br>then proceeded, with soul well-fixed on meditation, to the tirtha of<br>Sakta."
