                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Beholding Duryodhana struck down in battle by<br>Bhimasena, what, O Sanjaya, did the Pandavas and the Srinjayas do?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding Duryodhana slain by Bhimasena in battle, O<br>king, like a wild elephant slain by a lion, the Pandavas with Krishna<br>became filled with delight. The Pancalas and the Srinjayas also, upon the<br>fall of the Kuru king, waved their upper garments (in the air) and<br>uttered leonine roars. The very Earth seemed to be unable to bear those<br>rejoicing warriors. Some stretched their bows; others drew their<br>bowstrings. Some blew their huge conchs; others beat their drums. Some<br>sported and jumped about, while some amongst thy foes laughed aloud. Many<br>heroes repeatedly said these words unto Bhimasena, "Exceedingly difficult<br>and great hath been the fears that thou hast achieved today in battle, by<br>having struck down the Kuru king, himself a great warrior, with thy mace!<br>All these men regard this slaughter of the foe by thee to be like that of<br>Vritra by Indra himself! Who else, save thyself, O Vrikodara, could slay<br>the heroic Duryodhana while careering in diverse kinds of motion and<br>performing all the wheeling manoeuvres (characteristic of such<br>encounters)? Thou hast now reached the other shore of these hostilities,<br>that other shore which none else could reach. This feat that thou hast<br>achieved is incapable of being achieved by any other warriors. By good<br>luck, thou hast, O hero, like an infuriated elephant, crushed with thy<br>foot the head of Duryodhana on the field of battle! Having fought a<br>wonderful battle, by good luck, O sinless one, thou hast quaffed the<br>blood of Duhshasana, like a lion quaffing the blood of a buffalo! By good<br>luck, thou hast, by thy own energy, placed thy foot on the head of all<br>those that had injured the righteous-souled king Yudhishthira! In<br>consequence of having vanquished thy foes and of thy having slain<br>Duryodhana, by good luck, O Bhima, thy fame hath spread over the whole<br>world! Bards and eulogists applauded Shakra after the fall of Vritra,<br>even as we are now applauding thee, O Bharata, after the fall of thy<br>foes! Know, O Bharata, that the joy we felt upon the fall of Duryodhana<br>hath not yet abated in the least!" Even these were the words addressed to<br>Bhimasena by the assembled eulogists on that occasion! Whilst those<br>tigers among men, the Pancalas and the Pandavas, all filled with delight<br>were indulging in such language, the slayer of Madhu addressed them,<br>saying, "You rulers of men, it is not proper to slay a slain foe with<br>such cruel speeches repeatedly uttered. This wight of wicked<br>understanding hath already been slain. This sinful, shameless, and<br>covetous wretch, surrounded by sinful counsellors and ever regardless of<br>the advice of wise friends, met with his death even when he refused,<br>though repeatedly urged to contrary by Vidura and Drona and Kripa and<br>Sanjaya, to give unto the sons of Pandu their paternal share in the<br>kingdom which they had solicited at his hands! This wretch is not now fit<br>to be regarded either as a friend or a foe! What use in spending bitter<br>breath upon one who hath now become a piece of wood! Mount your cars<br>quickly, ye kings, for we should leave this place! By good luck, this<br>sinful wretch hath been slain with his counsellors and kinsmen and<br>friends!" Hearing these rebukes from Krishna, king Duryodhana, O monarch,<br>gave way to wrath and endeavoured to rise. Sitting on his haunches and<br>supporting himself on his two arms, he contracted his eyebrows and cast<br>angry glances at Vasudeva. The form then of Duryodhana whose body was<br>half raised looked like that of a poisonous snake, O Bharata, shorn of<br>its tail. Disregarding his poignant and unbearable pains, Duryodhana<br>began to afflict Vasudeva with keen and bitter words, "O son of Kansa's<br>slave, thou hast, it seems, no shame, for hast thou forgotten that I have<br>been struck down most unfairly, judged by the rules that prevail in<br>encounters with the mace? It was thou who unfairly caused this act by<br>reminding Bhima with a hint about the breaking of my thighs! Dost thou<br>think I did not mark it when Arjuna (acting under thy advice) hinted it<br>to Bhima? Having caused thousands of kings, who always fought fairly, to<br>be slain through diverse kinds of unfair means, feelest thou no shame or<br>no abhorrence for those acts? Day after day having caused a great carnage<br>of heroic warriors, thou causedst the grandsire to be slain by placing<br>Shikhandi to the fore! Having again caused an elephant of the name of<br>Ashvatthama to be slain, O thou of wicked understanding, thou causedst<br>the preceptor to lay aside his weapons. Thinkest thou that this is not<br>known to me! While again that valiant hero was about to be slain this<br>cruel Dhrishtadyumna, thou didst not dissuade the latter! The dart that<br>had been begged (of Shakra as a boon) by Karna for the slaughter of<br>Arjuna was baffled by thee through Ghatotkacha! Who is there that is more<br>sinful than thou? Similarly, the mighty Bhurishrava, with one of his arms<br>lopped off and while observant of the Praya vow, was caused to be slain<br>by thee through the agency of the high-souled Satyaki. Karna had done a<br>great feat for vanquishing Partha. Thou, however, causedst Aswasena, the<br>son of that prince of snakes (Takshaka), to be baffled in achieving his<br>purpose! When again the wheel of Karna's car sank in mire and Karna was<br>afflicted with calamity and almost vanquished on that account, when,<br>indeed, that foremost of men became anxious to liberate his wheel, thou<br>causedst that Karna to be then slain! If ye had fought me and Karna and<br>Bhishma and Drona by fair means, victory then, without doubt, would never<br>have been yours. By adopting the most crooked and unrighteous of means<br>thou hast caused many kings observant of the duties of their order and<br>ourselves also to be slain!'<br><br>"'Vasudeva said, "Thou, O son of Gandhari, hast been slain with thy<br>brothers, sons, kinsmen, friends, and followers, only in consequence of<br>the sinful path in which thou hast trod! Through thy evil acts those two<br>heroes, Bhishma and Drona, have been slain! Karna too hath been slain for<br>having imitated thy behaviour! Solicited by me, O fool, thou didst not,<br>from avarice, give the Pandavas their paternal share, acting according to<br>the counsels of Shakuni! Thou gavest poison to Bhimasena! Thou hadst,<br>also, O thou of wicked understanding, endeavoured to burn all the<br>Pandavas with their mother at the palace of lac! On the occasion also of<br>the gambling, thou hadst persecuted the daughter of Yajnasena, while in<br>her season, in the midst of the assembly! Shameless as thou art, even<br>then thou becamest worthy of being slain! Thou hadst, through Subala's<br>son well-versed in dice, unfairly vanquished the virtuous Yudhishthira<br>who was unskilled in gambling! For that art thou slain! Through the<br>sinful Jayadratha again, Krishna was on another occasion persecuted when<br>the Pandavas, her lords, had gone out hunting towards the hermitage of<br>Trinavindu! Causing Abhimanyu, who was a child and alone, to be<br>surrounded by many, thou didst slay that hero. It is in consequence of<br>that fault, O sinful wretch, that thou art slain! All those unrighteous<br>acts that thou sayest have been perpetrated by us, have in reality been<br>perpetrated by thee in consequence of thy sinful nature! Thou didst never<br>listen to the counsels of Brihaspati and Usanas! Thou didst never wait<br>upon the old! Thou didst never hear beneficial words! Enslaved by<br>ungovernable covetousness and thirst of gain, thou didst perpetrate many<br>unrighteous acts! Bear now the consequences of those acts of thine!"<br><br>"'Duryodhana said, "I have studied, made presents according to the<br>ordinance, governed the wide Earth with her seas, and stood over the<br>heads of my foes! Who is there so fortunate as myself! That end again<br>which is courted by Kshatriyas observant of the duties of their own<br>order, death in battle, hath become mine. Who, therefore, is so fortunate<br>as myself? Human enjoyments such as were worthy of the very gods and such<br>as could with difficulty be obtained by other kings, had been mine.<br>Prosperity of the very highest kind had been attained by me! Who then is<br>so fortunate as myself? With all my well-wishers, and my younger<br>brothers, I am going to heaven, O thou of unfading glory! As regards<br>yourselves, with your purposes unachieved and torn by grief, live ye in<br>this unhappy world!"'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Upon the conclusion of these words of the<br>intelligent king of the Kurus, a thick shower of fragrant flowers fell<br>from the sky. The Gandharvas played upon many charming musical<br>instruments. The Apsaras in a chorus sang the glory of king Duryodhana.<br>The Siddhas uttered loud sound to the effect, "Praise be to king<br>Duryodhana!" Fragrant and delicious breezes mildly blew on every side.<br>All the quarters became clear and the firmament looked blue as the lapis<br>lazuli. Beholding these exceedingly wonderful things and this worship<br>offered to Duryodhana, the Pandavas headed by Vasudeva became ashamed.<br>Hearing (invisible beings cry out) that Bhishma and Drona and Karna and<br>Bhurishrava were slain unrighteously, they became afflicted with grief<br>and wept in sorrow. Beholding the Pandavas filled with anxiety and grief,<br>Krishna addressed them in a voice deep as that of the clouds or the drum,<br>saying, "All of them were great car-warriors and exceedingly quick in the<br>use of weapons! If ye had put forth all your prowess, even then ye could<br>never have slain them in battle by fighting fairly! King Duryodhana also<br>could never be slain in a fair encounter! The same is the case with all<br>those mighty car-warriors headed by Bhishma! From desire of doing good to<br>you, I repeatedly applied my powers of illusion and caused them to be<br>slain by diverse means in battle. If I had not adopted such deceitful<br>ways in battle, victory would never have been yours, nor kingdom, nor<br>wealth! Those four were very high-souled warriors and regarded as<br>Atirathas in the world. The very Regents of the Earth could not slay them<br>in fair fight! Similarly, the son of Dhritarashtra, though fatigued when<br>armed with the mace, could not be slain in fair fight by Yama himself<br>armed with his bludgeon! You should not take it to heart that this foe of<br>yours hath been slain deceitfully. When the number of one's foes becomes<br>great, then destruction should be effected by contrivances and means. The<br>gods themselves, in slaying the Asuras, have trod the same way. That way,<br>therefore, that hath been trod by the gods, may be trod by all. We have<br>been crowned with success. It is evening. We had better depart to our<br>tents. Let us all, ye kings, take rest with our steeds and elephants and<br>cars." Hearing these words of Vasudeva, the Pandavas and the Pancalas,<br>filled with delight, roared like a multitude of lions. All of them blew<br>their conchs and Jadava himself blew Panchajanya, filled with joy, O bull<br>among men, at the sight of Duryodhana struck down in battle.'"
