                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding Duryodhana felled upon the earth like a<br>gigantic Sala uprooted (by the tempest) the Pandavas became filled with<br>joy. The Somakas also beheld, with hair standing on end, the Kuru king<br>felled upon the earth like an infuriated elephant felled by a lion.<br>Having struck Duryodhana down, the valiant Bhimasena, approaching the<br>Kuru chief, addressed him, saying, "O wretch, formerly laughing at the<br>disrobed Draupadi in the midst of the assembly, thou hadst, O fool,<br>addressed us as 'Cow, Cow!' Bear now the fruit of that insult!" Having<br>said these words, he touched the head of his fallen foe with his left<br>foot. Indeed, he struck the head of that lion among kings with his foot.<br>With eyes red in wrath, Bhimasena, that grinder of hostile armies, once<br>more said these words. Listen to them, O monarch! "They that danced at us<br>insultingly, saying, 'Cow, Cow!' we shall now dance at them, uttering the<br>same words, 'Cow, Cow!' We have no guile, no fire, no match, at dice, no<br>deception! Depending upon the might of our own arms we resist and check<br>our foes!" Having attained to the other shores of those fierce<br>hostilities, Vrikodara once more laughingly said these words slowly unto<br>Yudhishthira and Keshava and Srinjaya and Dhananjaya and the two sons of<br>Madri, "They that had dragged Draupadi, while ill, into the assembly and<br>had disrobed her there, behold those Dhartarashtras slain in battle by<br>the Pandavas through the ascetic penances of Yajnasena's daughter! Those<br>wicked-hearted sons of king Dhritarashtra who had called us 'Sesame seeds<br>without kernel,' have all been slain by us with their relatives and<br>followers! It matters little whether (as a consequence of those deeds) we<br>go to heaven or fall into hell!" Once more, uplifting the mace that lay<br>on his shoulders, he struck with his left foot the head of the monarch<br>who was prostrate on the earth, and addressing the deceitful Duryodhana,<br>said these words. Many of the foremost warriors among the Somakas, who<br>were all of righteous souls, beholding the foot of the rejoicing<br>Bhimasena of narrow heart placed upon the head of that foremost one of<br>Kuru's race, did not at all approve of it. While Vrikodara, after having<br>struck down thy son, was thus bragging and dancing madly, king<br>Yudhishthira addressed him, saying, "Thou hast paid off thy hostility<br>(towards Duryodhana) and accomplished thy vow by a fair or an unfair act!<br>Cease now, O Bhima! Do not crush his head with thy foot! Do not act<br>sinfully! Duryodhana is a king! He is, again, thy kinsman! He is fallen!<br>This conduct of thine, O sinless one, is not proper. Duryodhana was the<br>lord of eleven Akshauhinis of troops. He was the king of the Kurus. Do<br>not, O Bhima, touch a king and a kinsman with thy foot. His kinsmen are<br>slain. His friends and counsellors are gone. His troops have been<br>exterminated. He has been struck down in battle. He is to be pitied in<br>every respect. He deserves not to be insulted, for remember that he is a<br>king. He is ruined. His friends and kinsmen have been slain. His brothers<br>have been killed. His sons too have been slain. His funeral cake hath<br>been taken away. He is our brother. This that thou doest unto him is not<br>proper. 'Bhimasena is a man of righteous behaviour': people used to say<br>this before of thee! Why then, O Bhimasena, dost thou insult the king in<br>this way?" Having said these words unto Bhimasena, Yudhishthira, with<br>voice choked in tears, and afflicted with grief, approached Duryodhana,<br>that chastiser of foes, and said unto him, "O sire, thou shouldst not<br>give way to anger nor grieve for thyself. Without doubt thou bearest the<br>dreadful consequences of thy own former acts. Without doubt this sad and<br>woeful result had been ordained by the Creator himself, that we should<br>injure thee and thou shouldst injure us, O foremost one of Kuru's race!<br>Through thy own fault this great calamity has come upon thee, due to<br>avarice and pride and folly, O Bharata! Having caused thy companions and<br>brothers and sires and sons and grandsons and others to be all slain,<br>thou comest now by thy own death. In consequence of thy fault, thy<br>brothers, mighty car-warriors all, and thy kinsmen have been slain by us.<br>I think all this to be the work of irresistible Destiny. Thou art not to<br>be pitied. On the other hand, thy death, O sinless one, is enviable. It<br>is we that deserve to be pitied in every respect, O Kaurava! We shall<br>have to drag on a miserable existence, reft of all our dear friends and<br>kinsmen. Alas, how shall I behold the widows, overwhelmed with grief and<br>deprived of their senses by sorrow, of my brothers and sons and<br>grandsons! Thou, O king, departest from this world! Thou art sure to have<br>thy residence in heaven! We, on the other hand, shall be reckoned as<br>creatures of hell, and shall continue to suffer the most poignant grief!<br>The grief-afflicted wives of Dhritarashtra's sons and grandsons, those<br>widows crushed with sorrow, will without doubt, curse us all!" Having<br>said these words, Dharma's royal son, Yudhishthira, deeply afflicted with<br>grief, began to breathe hard and indulge in lamentations.'"
