                            Janamejaya said, "Why did the adorable Arshtishena undergo the austerest<br>of penances? How also did Sindhudwipa acquire the status of a Brahmana?<br>How also did Devapi, O Brahmana, and how Vishvamitra, O best of men,<br>acquire the same status? Tell me all this, O adorable one! Great is my<br>curiosity to listen to all these."<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "Formerly, in the Krita age, O king, there was a<br>foremost of regenerate persons called Arshtishena. Residing in his<br>preceptor's house, he attended to his lessons every day. Although, O<br>king, he resided long in the abode of his preceptor, he could not still<br>acquire the mastery of any branch of knowledge or of the Vedas. O<br>monarch! In great disappointment, O king, the great ascetic performed<br>very austere penances. By his penances he then acquired the mastery of<br>the Vedas, to which there is nothing superior. Acquiring great learning<br>and a mastery of the Vedas, that foremost of Rishis became crowned with<br>success in that tirtha. He then bestowed three boons on that place. (He<br>said), 'From this day, a person, by bathing in this tirtha of the great<br>river (Sarasvati), shall obtain the great fruit of a horse sacrifice!<br>From this day there will be no fear in this tirtha from snakes and wild<br>beasts! By small exertions, again, one shall attain to great result<br>here!' Having said these words, that Muni of great energy proceeded to<br>heaven. Even thus the adorable Arshtishena of great energy became crowned<br>with success. In that very tirtha in the Krita age, Sindhudwipa of great<br>energy, and Devapi also, O monarch, had acquired the high status of<br>Brahmanhood. Similarly Kusika's son, devoted to ascetic penances and with<br>his senses under control, acquired the status of Brahmanhood by<br>practising well-directed austerities. There was a great Kshatriya,<br>celebrated over the world, known by the name of Gadhi. He had a son born<br>to him, of the name of Vishvamitra of great prowess. King Kausika became<br>a great ascetic. Possessed of great ascetic merit, he wished to install<br>his son Vishvamitra on his throne, himself having resolved to cast off<br>his body. His subjects, bowing unto him, said, 'Thou shouldst not go<br>away, O thou of great wisdom, but do thou protect us from a great fear!'<br>Thus addressed, Gadhi replied unto his subjects, saying, 'My son will<br>become the protector of the wide universe!' Having said these words, and<br>placed Vishvamitra (on the throne), Gadhi, O king, went to heaven, and<br>Vishvamitra became king. He could not, however, protect the earth with<br>even his best exertions. The king then heard of the existence of a great<br>fear of Rakshasas (in his kingdom). With his four kinds of forces, he<br>went out of his capital. Having proceeded far on his way, he reached the<br>asylum of Vasishtha. His troops, O king, caused much mischief there. The<br>adorable Brahmana Vasishtha, when he came to his asylum, saw the<br>extensive woods in course of destruction. That best of Rishis, Vasishtha,<br>O king, became angry, O monarch, with Vishvamitra. He commanded his own<br>(homa) cow, saying, 'Create a number of terrible Savaras!' Thus<br>addressed, the cow created a swarm of men of frightful visages. These<br>encountered the army of Vishvamitra and began to cause a great carnage<br>everywhere. Seeing this, his troops fled away. Vishvamitra, the son of<br>Gadhi, however, regarding ascetic austerities highly efficacious, set his<br>heart upon them. In this foremost of tirthas of the Sarasvati, O king, he<br>began to emaciate his own body by means of vows and fasts with fixed<br>resolve. He made water and air and (the fallen) leaves of trees his food.<br>He slept on the bare ground, and observed other vows (enjoined for<br>ascetics). The gods made repeated attempts for impeding him in the<br>observance of his vows. His heart, however, never swerved from the vows<br>(he had proposed to himself). Then, having practised diverse kinds of<br>austerities with great devotion, the son of Gadhi became like the Sun<br>himself in effulgence. The boon-giving Grandsire, of great energy,<br>resolved to grant Vishvamitra, when he had become endued with ascetic<br>merit, the boon the latter desired. The boon that Vishvamitra solicited<br>was that he should be permitted to become a Brahmana. Brahma the<br>Grandsire of all the worlds, said unto him, 'So be it.' Having by his<br>austere penances acquired the status of Brahmanhood, the illustrious<br>Vishvamitra, after the attainment of his wish, wandered over the whole<br>Earth like a celestial. Giving away diverse kinds of wealth in that<br>foremost of tirthas, Rama also cheerfully gave away milch cows and<br>vehicles and beds, ornaments, and food and drink of the best kinds, O<br>king, unto many foremost of Brahmanas, after having worshipped them duly.<br>Then, O king, Rama proceeded to the asylum of Vaka which was not very<br>distant from where he was, that asylum in which, as heard by us, Dalvya<br>Vaka had practised the austerest of penances."
