                            Om! Having bowed down unto Narayana and Nara, the most exalted of male<br>beings, and the goddess Sarasvati, must the word Jaya be uttered.<br><br>Janamejaya said, "After Karna had thus been slain in battle by Savyasaci,<br>what did the small (unslaughtered) remnant of the Kauravas do, O<br>regenerate one? Beholding the army of the Pandavas swelling with might<br>and energy, what behaviour did the Kuru prince Suyodhana adopt towards<br>the Pandavas, thinking it suitable to the hour? I desire to hear all<br>this. Tell me, O foremost of regenerate ones, I am never satiated with<br>listening to the grand feats of my ancestors."<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "After the fall of Karna, O king, Dhritarashtra's son<br>Suyodhana was plunged deep into an ocean of grief and saw despair on<br>every side. Indulging in incessant lamentations, saying, 'Alas, oh Karna!<br>Alas, oh Karna!' he proceeded with great difficulty to his camp,<br>accompanied by the unslaughtered remnant of the kings on his side.<br>Thinking of the slaughter of the Suta's son, he could not obtain peace of<br>mind, though comforted by those kings with excellent reasons inculcated<br>by the scriptures. Regarding destiny and necessity to be all-powerful,<br>the Kuru king firmly resolved on battle. Having duly made Shalya the<br>generalissimo of his forces, that bull among kings, O monarch, proceeded<br>for battle, accompanied by that unslaughtered remnant of his forces.<br>Then, O chief of Bharata's race, a terrible battle took place between the<br>troops of the Kurus and those of the Pandavas, resembling that between<br>the gods and the Asuras. Then Shalya, O monarch, having made a great<br>carnage in battle at last lost a large number of his troops and was slain<br>by Yudhishthira at midday. Then king Duryodhana, having lost all his<br>friends and kinsmen, fled away from the field of battle and penetrated<br>into the depths of a terrible lake from fear of his enemies. On the<br>afternoon of that day, Bhimasena, causing the lake to be encompassed by<br>many mighty car-warriors, summoned Duryodhana and having obliged him to<br>come out, slew him speedily, putting forth his strength. After<br>Duryodhana's slaughter, the three car-warriors (of the Kuru side) that<br>were still unslain (Ashvatthama and Kripa and Kritavarma), filled with<br>rage, O monarch, slaughtered the Pancala troops in the night. On the next<br>morning Sanjaya, having set out from the camp, entered the city (the Kuru<br>capital), cheerless and filled with grief and sorrow. Having entered the<br>city, the Suta Sanjaya, raising his arms in grief, and with limbs<br>trembling, entered the palace of the king. Filled with grief, O tiger<br>among men, he wept aloud, saying, 'Alas, O king! Alas, all of us are<br>ruined by the slaughter of that high-souled monarch. Alas, Time is<br>all-powerful, and crooked in his course, since all our allies, endued<br>with might equal to that of Shakra himself, have been slain by the<br>Pandavas.' Seeing Sanjaya come back to the city, O king, in that<br>distressful plight, all the people, O best of kings, filled with great<br>anxiety, wept loudly, saying, 'Alas, O king! The whole city, O tiger<br>among men, including the very children, hearing of Duryodhana's death,<br>sent forth notes of lamentation from every side. We then beheld all the<br>men and women running about, deeply afflicted with grief, their senses<br>gone, and resembling people that are demented.' The Suta Sanjaya then,<br>deeply agitated, entered the abode of the king and beheld that foremost<br>of monarchs, that lord of men, having wisdom for his eyes. Beholding the<br>sinless monarch, that chief of Bharata's race, seated, surrounded by his<br>daughters-in-law and Gandhari and Vidura and by other friends and kinsmen<br>that were always his well-wishers, and engaged in thinking on that very<br>subject&#8212;the death of Karna&#8212;the Suta Sanjaya, with heart filled with<br>grief, O Janamejaya, weepingly and in a voice choked with tears, said<br>unto him, 'I am Sanjaya, O tiger among men. I bow to thee, O bull of<br>Bharata's race. The ruler of the Madras, Shalya, hath been slain.<br>Similarly, Subala's son Shakuni, and Uluka, O tiger among men, that<br>valiant son of the gamester (Shakuni), have been slain. All the<br>Samsaptakas, the Kambojas together with the Sakas, the Mlecchas, the<br>Mountaineers, and the Yavanas, have also been slain. The Easterners have<br>been slain, O monarch, and all the Southerners. The Northerners have all<br>been slain, as also the Westerners, O ruler of men. All the kings and all<br>the princes have been slain, O monarch. King Duryodhana also has been<br>slain by the son of Pandu after the manner he had vowed. With his thighs<br>broken, O monarch, he lieth now on the dust, covered with blood.<br>Dhrishtadyumna also hath been slain, O king, as also the vanquished<br>Shikhandi. Uttamauja and Yudhamanyu, O king, and the Prabhadrakas, and<br>those tiger among men, the Pancalas, and the Cedis, have been destroyed.<br>The sons have all been slain as also the (five) sons of Draupadi, O<br>Bharata. The heroic and mighty son of Karna, Vrishasena, hath been slain.<br>All the men that had been assembled have been slain. All the elephants<br>have been destroyed. All the car-warriors, O tiger among men, and all the<br>steeds, have fallen in battle. Very few are alive on thy side, O lord. In<br>consequence of the Pandavas and the Kauravas having encountered each<br>other, the world, stupefied by Time, now consists of only women. On the<br>side of the Pandavas seven are alive, they are the five Pandava brothers,<br>and Vasudeva, and Satyaki and amongst the Dhartarashtras three are so,<br>Kripa, Kritavarma, and Drona's son, that foremost of victors. These three<br>car-warriors, O monarch, are all that survive, O best of kings, of all<br>the akshauhinis mustered on thy side, O ruler of men. These are the<br>survivors, O monarch, the rest have perished. Making Duryodhana and his<br>hostility (towards the Pandavas) the cause, the world, it seems, hath<br>been destroyed, O bull of Bharata's race, by Time.'"<br><br>Vaishampayana continued, "Hearing these cruel words, Dhritarashtra, that<br>ruler of men, fell down, O monarch, on the earth, deprived of his senses.<br>As soon as the king fell down, Vidura also, of great fame, O monarch,<br>afflicted with sorrow on account of the king's distress, fell down on the<br>earth. Gandhari also, O best of kings, and all the Kuru ladies, suddenly<br>fell down on the ground, hearing those cruel words. That entire conclave<br>of royal persons remained lying on the ground, deprived of their senses<br>and raving deliriously, like figures painted on a large piece of canvas.<br>Then king Dhritarashtra, that lord of earth, afflicted with the calamity<br>represented by the death of his sons, slowly and with difficulty regained<br>his life-breaths. Having recovered his senses, the king, with trembling<br>limbs and sorrowful heart, turned his face on every side, and said these<br>words unto Kshattri (Vidura). 'O learned Kshattri, O thou of great<br>wisdom, thou, O bull of Bharata's race, art now my refuge. I am lordless<br>and destitute of all my sons.' Having said this, he once more fell down,<br>deprived of his senses. Beholding him fallen, all his kinsmen that were<br>present there sprinkled cold water over him and fanned him with fans.<br>Comforted after a long while, that lord of earth, afflicted with sorrow<br>on account of the death of his sons, remained silent, sighing heavily, O<br>monarch, like a snake put into a jar. Sanjaya also wept aloud, beholding<br>the king so afflicted. All the ladies too, with Gandhari of great<br>celebrity, did the same. After a long while, O best of men,<br>Dhritarashtra, having repeatedly swooned, addressed Vidura, saying, 'Let<br>all the ladies retire, as also Gandhari of great fame, and all these<br>friends. My mind hath become greatly unsettled.' Thus addressed, Vidura,<br>repeatedly trembling, slowly dismissed the ladies, O bull of Bharata's<br>race. All those ladies retired, O chief of the Bharatas, as also all<br>those friends, beholding the king deeply afflicted. Then Sanjaya<br>cheerlessly looked at the king, O scorcher of foes, who, having recovered<br>his senses, was weeping in great affliction. With joined hands, Vidura<br>then, in sweet words, comforted that ruler of men who was sighing<br>incessantly.'"
