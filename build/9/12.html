                            "Sanjaya said, 'Seeing his driver fallen, Shalya, O king, quickly took up<br>his mace made wholly of iron and stood immovable as a bull. Bhima,<br>however, armed with his mighty mace, rushed impetuously towards Shalya<br>who then looked like the blazing Yuga-fire, or the Destroyer armed with<br>the noose, or the Kailasa mountain with its formidable crest, or Vasava<br>with his thunder, or Mahadeva with his trident, or an infuriate elephant<br>in the forest. At that time the blare of thousands of conchs and trumpets<br>and loud leonine roars arose there, enhancing the delight of heroes. The<br>combatants of both armies, looking at those two foremost of warriors from<br>every side, applauded them both, saying, "Excellent, Excellent! Save the<br>ruler of the Madras, or Rama, that delighter of the Yadus, there is none<br>else that can venture to endure the impetuosity of Bhima in battle.<br>Similarly, save Bhima, there is no other warrior that can venture to<br>endure the force of the mace of the illustrious king of the Madras in<br>battle." Those two combatants then, Vrikodara and the ruler of the<br>Madras, roaring like bulls, careered in circles, frequently jumping up in<br>the air. In that encounter between those two lions among men, no<br>difference could be noticed between them either in respect of their<br>careering in circles or of their wielding the mace. The mace of Shalya,<br>wrapped round with a resplendent cloth of gold that looked like a sheet<br>of fire, inspired the spectators with dread. Similarly, the mace of the<br>high-souled Bhima, as the latter careered in circles, looked like<br>lightning in the midst of the clouds. Struck by the ruler of the Madras<br>with his mace, the mace of Bhima, O king, produced sparks of fire in the<br>welkin which thereupon seemed to be ablaze. Similarly, struck by Bhima<br>with his mace, the mace of Shalya produced a shower of blazing coals<br>which seemed exceedingly wonderful. Like two gigantic elephants striking<br>each other with their tusks, or two huge bulls striking each other with<br>their horns, those two heroes began to strike each other with their<br>foremost of maces, like a couple of combatants striking each other with<br>iron bound clubs. Their limbs being struck with each other's mace, they<br>soon became bathed in blood and looked handsomer in consequence like two<br>flowering Kinsukas. Struck by the ruler of the Madras on both his left<br>and right, the mighty-armed Bhimasena stood immovable like a mountain.<br>Similarly, though struck repeatedly with the force of Bhima's mace,<br>Shalya, O king, moved not, like a mountain assailed by an elephant with<br>his tusks. The noise made by the blows of the maces of those two lions<br>among men was heard on all sides like successive peals of thunder. Having<br>ceased for a moment, those two warriors of great energy once more began,<br>with uplifted maces, to career in closer circles. Once more the clash<br>took place between those two warriors of superhuman feats, each having<br>advanced towards the other by eight steps, and each assailing the other<br>with his uplifted iron club. Then, wishing to get at each other, they<br>once more careered in circles. Both accomplished (in the use of the mace)<br>they began to display their superiority of skill. Uplifting their<br>terrible weapons, they then again struck each other like mountains<br>striking each other with their crests at the time of an earthquake.<br>Exceedingly crushed with each other's mace in consequence of each other's<br>strength, both those heroes fell down at the same time like a couple of<br>poles set up for Indra's worship. The brave combatants then of both<br>armies, at that sight, uttered cries of "Oh!" and "Alas!" Struck with<br>great force in their vital limbs, both of them had become exceedingly<br>agitated. Then the mighty Kripa, taking up Shalya, that bull among the<br>Madras, on his own car, quickly bore him away from the field of battle.<br>Within, however, the twinkling of an eye, Bhimasena, rising up, and still<br>reeling as if drunk, challenged, with uplifted mace, the ruler of the<br>Madras. Then the heroic warriors of thy army, armed with diverse weapons,<br>fought with the Pandavas, causing diverse musical instruments to be blown<br>and beat. With uplifted arms and weapons and making a loud noise, O<br>monarch, thy warriors headed by Duryodhana rushed against the Pandavas.<br>Beholding the Kaurava host, the sons of Pandu, with leonine roars, rushed<br>against those warriors headed by Duryodhana. Then thy son, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, singling out Chekitana amongst those rushing heroes,<br>pierced him deeply with a lance in the chest. Thus assailed by thy son,<br>Chekitana fell down on the terrace of his car, covered with blood, and<br>overcome with a deep swoon. Beholding Chekitana slain, the great<br>car-warriors among the Pandavas incessantly poured their arrowy showers<br>(upon the Kauravas). Indeed, the Pandavas, inspired with desire of<br>victory, O monarch, careered beautifully on all sides amongst thy<br>divisions. Kripa, and Kritavarma, and the mighty son of Subala, placing<br>the ruler of the Madras before them, fought with king Yudhishthira the<br>just. Duryodhana, O monarch, fought with Dhrishtadyumna, the slayer of<br>Bharadwaja's son, that hero endued with abundant energy and prowess.<br>3,000 cars, O king, despatched by thy son and headed by Drona's son,<br>battled with Vijaya (Arjuna). All those combatants, O king, had firmly<br>resolved to win victory and had cast off fear with life itself. Indeed, O<br>king, thy warriors penetrated into the midst of the Pandava army like<br>swans into a large lake. A fierce battle then took place between the<br>Kurus and the Pandavas, the combatants being actuated with the desire of<br>slaughtering one another and deriving great pleasure from giving and<br>receiving blows. During the progress, O king, of that battle which was<br>destructive of great heroes, an earthly dust, terrible to behold, was<br>raised by the wind. From only the names we heard (of the Pandava<br>warriors) that were uttered in course of that battle and from those (of<br>the Kuru warriors) that were uttered by the Pandavas, we knew the<br>combatants that fought with one another fearlessly. That dust, however, O<br>tiger among men, was soon dispelled by the blood that was shed, and all<br>the points of the compass became once more clear when that dusty darkness<br>was driven away. Indeed, during the progress of that terrible and awful<br>battle, no one among either thy warriors or those of the foe, turned his<br>back. Desirous of attaining to the regions of Brahman and longing for<br>victory by fair fight, the combatants displayed their prowess, inspired<br>with the hope of heaven. For paying off the debt they owed to their<br>masters on account of the sustenance granted by the latter, or firmly<br>resolved to accomplish the objects of their friends and allies, the<br>warriors, with hearts fixed on heaven, fought with one another on that<br>occasion. Shooting and hurling weapons of diverse kinds, great<br>car-warriors roared at or smote one another. "Slay, pierce, seize,<br>strike, cut off!" These were the words that were heard in that battle,<br>uttered by the warriors and those of the foe. Then Shalya, O monarch,<br>desirous of slaying him, pierced king Yudhishthira the just, that mighty<br>car-warrior with many sharp arrows. Conversant with what are the vital<br>limbs of the body, the son of Pritha, however, O monarch, with the<br>greatest ease, struck the ruler of the Madras with four and ten<br>cloth-yard shafts, aiming at the latter's vital limbs. Resisting the son<br>of Pandu with his shafts, Shalya of great fame, filled with rage and<br>desirous of slaying his adversary, pierced him in that battle with<br>innumerable arrows equipped with Kanka feathers. Once more, O monarch, he<br>struck Yudhishthira with a straight shaft in the very sight of all the<br>troops. King Yudhishthira the just, possessed of great fame and filled<br>with rage, pierced the ruler of the Madras with many keen arrows equipped<br>with feathers of Kankas and peacocks. The mighty car-warrior then pierced<br>Candrasena with seventy arrows and Shalya's driver with nine, and<br>Drumasena with four and sixty. When the two protectors of his car-wheels<br>were (thus) slain by the high-souled son of Pandu, Shalya, O king, slew<br>five and twenty warriors among the Cedis. And he pierced Satyaki with<br>five and twenty keen arrows, and Bhimasena with seven, and the two sons<br>of Madri with a hundred, in that battle. While Shalya was thus careering<br>in that battle, that best of kings, the son of Pritha, sped at him many<br>shafts that resembled snakes of virulent poison. With a broad-headed<br>arrow, Yudhishthira the son of Kunti then cut off from his car the<br>standard top of his adversary as the latter stood in his front. We saw<br>the standard of Shalya, which was thus cut off by the son of Pandu in<br>that great battle, fall down like a riven mountain summit. Seeing his<br>standard fallen and observing the son of Pandu standing before him, the<br>ruler of the Madras became filled with rage and shot showers of shafts.<br>That bull amongst Kshatriyas, Shalya of immeasurable soul, poured over<br>the Kshatriyas in that battle dense showers of arrows like the deity of<br>the clouds pouring torrents of rain. Piercing Satyaki and Bhimasena and<br>the twin sons of Madri by Pandu, each with five arrows, he afflicted<br>Yudhishthira greatly. We then, O monarch, beheld a net of arrows spread<br>before the chest of Pandu's son like a mass of risen clouds. The mighty<br>car-warrior Shalya, in that battle, filled with rage, shrouded<br>Yudhishthira with straight shafts. At this, king Yudhishthira afflicted<br>with those showers of shafts, felt himself deprived of his prowess, even<br>as the Asura Jambha had become before the slayer of Vritra.'"
