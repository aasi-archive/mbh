                            Janamejaya said, "Why is the current of (the tirtha known by the name of)<br>Vasishthapavaha so rapid? For what reason did the foremost of rivers bear<br>away Vasishtha? What, O lord, was the cause of the dispute between<br>Vasishtha and Vishvamitra? Questioned by me, O thou of great wisdom, tell<br>me all this! I am never satiated with hearing thee!"<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "A great enmity arose between Vishvamitra and<br>Vasishtha, O Bharata, due to their rivalry in respect of ascetic<br>austerities. The high abode of Vasishtha was in the tirtha called Sthanu<br>on the eastern bank of the Sarasvati. On the opposite bank was the asylum<br>of the intelligent Vishvamitra. There, in that tirtha, O monarch, Sthanu<br>(Mahadeva) had practised the austerest penances. Sages still speak of<br>those fierce feats. Having performed a sacrifice there and worshipped the<br>river Sarasvati, Sthanu established that tirtha there. Hence it is known<br>by the name Sthanu-tirtha, O lord. In that tirtha, the celestials had, in<br>days of yore, O king, installed Skanda, that slayer of the enemies of the<br>gods, in the supreme command of their army. Unto that tirtha of the<br>Sarasvati, the great Rishi Vishvamitra, by the aid of his austere<br>penances, brought Vasishtha. Listen to that history. The two ascetics<br>Vishvamitra and Vasishtha, O Bharata, every day challenged each other<br>very earnestly in respect of the superiority of their penances. The great<br>Muni Vishvamitra, burning (with jealousy) at sight of the energy of<br>Vasishtha, began to reflect on the matter. Though devoted to the<br>performance of his duties, this, however, is the resolution, O Bharata,<br>that he formed: 'This Sarasvati shall quickly bring, by force of her<br>current, that foremost of ascetics, Vasishtha, to my presence. After he<br>shall have been brought hither, I shall, without doubt, slay that<br>foremost of regenerate ones.' Having settled this, the illustrious and<br>great Rishi Vishvamitra with eyes red in wrath, thought of that foremost<br>of rivers. Thus remembered by the ascetic, she became exceedingly<br>agitated. The fair lady, however, repaired to that Rishi of great energy<br>and great wrath. Pale and trembling, Sarasvati, with joined hands<br>appeared before that foremost of sages. Indeed, the lady was much<br>afflicted with grief, even like a woman who has lost her mighty lord. And<br>she said unto that best of sages, 'Tell me what is there that I shall do<br>for thee.' Filled with rage, the ascetic said unto her, 'Bring hither<br>Vasishtha without delay, so that I may slay him.' Hearing these words the<br>river became agitated. With joined hands the lotus-eyed lady began to<br>tremble exceedingly in fear like a creeper shaken by the wind. Beholding<br>the great river in that plight, the ascetic said unto her, 'Without any<br>scruple, bring Vasishtha unto my presence!' Hearing these words of his,<br>and knowing the evil he intended to do, and acquainted also with the<br>prowess of Vasishtha that was unrivalled on earth, she repaired to<br>Vasishtha and informed him of what the intelligent Vishvamitra had said<br>unto her. Fearing the curse of both, she trembled repeatedly. Indeed, her<br>heart was on the grievous curse (that either of them might pronounce on<br>her). She stood in terror of both. Seeing her pale and plunged in<br>anxiety, the righteous-souled Vasishtha, that foremost of men, O king,<br>said these words unto her.<br><br>"Vasishtha said, 'O foremost of rivers, save thyself! O thou of rapid<br>current, bear me away, otherwise Vishvamitra will curse thee. Do not feel<br>any scruple.' Hearing these words of that compassionate Rishi, the river<br>began to think, O Kauravya, as to what course would be best for her to<br>follow. Even these were the thoughts that arose in her mind: 'Vasishtha<br>showeth great compassion for me. It is proper for me that I should serve<br>him.' Beholding then that best of Rishis, (Vasishtha) engaged in silent<br>recitation (of mantras) on her bank, and seeing Kusika's son<br>(Vishvamitra) also engaged in homa, Sarasvati thought, 'Even this is my<br>opportunity.' Then that foremost of rivers, by her current, washed away<br>one of her banks. In washing away that bank, she bore Vasishtha away.<br>While being borne away, O king, Vasishtha praised the river in these<br>words: 'From the Grandsire's (manasa) lake thou hast taken thy rise, O<br>Sarasvati! This whole universe is filled with thy excellent waters!<br>Wending through the firmament, O goddess, thou impartest thy waters to<br>the clouds! All the waters are thee! Through thee we exercise our<br>thinking faculties! Thou art Pushti and Dyuti, Kirti, and Siddhi and Uma!<br>Thou art Speech, and thou art Svaha! This whole universe is dependent on<br>thee! It is thou that dwellest in all creatures, in four forms!' Thus<br>praised by that great Rishi, Sarasvati, O king, speedily bore that<br>Brahmana towards the asylum of Vishvamitra and repeatedly represented<br>unto the latter the arrival of the former. Beholding Vasishtha thus<br>brought before him by Sarasvati, Vishvamitra, filled with rage, began to<br>look for a weapon wherewith to slay that brahmana. Seeing him filled with<br>wrath, the river from fear of (witnessing and aiding in) a brahmana's<br>slaughter, quickly bore Vasishtha away to her eastern bank once more. She<br>thus obeyed the words of both, although she deceived the son of Gadhi by<br>her act. Seeing that best of Rishis, Vasishtha, borne away, the<br>vindictive Vishvamitra, filled with wrath, addressed Sarasvati. saying,<br>'Since, O foremost of rivers, thou hast gone away, having deceived me,<br>let thy current be changed into blood that is acceptable to Rakshasas.'<br>Then, cursed by the intelligent Vishvamitra, Sarasvati flowed for a whole<br>year, bearing blood mixed with water. The gods, the Gandharvas, and the<br>Apsaras, beholding the Sarasvati reduced to that plight, became filled<br>with great sorrow. For this reason, O king, the tirtha came to be called<br>Vasishthapravaha on earth. The foremost of rivers, however, once more got<br>back her own proper condition."
