                            "Sanjaya said, 'Duryodhana, O king, and Dhrishtadyumna, the son of<br>Prishata, fought a fierce battle, using arrows and darts in profusion.<br>Both of them, O monarch, shot showers of arrows like showers of rain<br>poured by the clouds in the rainy season. The (Kuru) king, having pierced<br>with five arrows the slayer of Drona, Prishata's son of fierce shafts,<br>once more pierced him with seven arrows. Endued with great might and<br>steady prowess, Dhrishtadyumna, in that battle, afflicted Duryodhana with<br>seventy arrows. Beholding the king thus afflicted, O bull of Bharata's<br>race, his uterine brothers, accompanied by a large force, encompassed the<br>son of Prishata. Surrounded by those Atirathas on every side, the Pancala<br>hero, O king, careered in that battle, displaying his quickness in the<br>use of weapons. Shikhandi, supported by the Prabhadrakas, fought with two<br>Kuru bowmen, Kritavarma and the great car-warrior Kripa. Then also, O<br>monarch, that battle became fierce and awful since the warriors were all<br>resolved to lay down their lives and since all of them fought, making<br>life the stake. Shalya, shooting showers of shafts on all sides,<br>afflicted the Pandavas with Satyaki and Vrikodara amongst them. With<br>patience and great strength, O monarch, the king of the Madras at the<br>same time fought with the twins (Nakula and Sahadeva), each of whom<br>resembled the Destroyer himself in prowess. The great car-warriors among<br>the Pandavas who were mangled in that great battle with the shafts of<br>Shalya, failed to find a protector. Then the heroic Nakula, the son of<br>Madri, seeing king Yudhishthira the just greatly afflicted, rushed with<br>speed against his maternal uncle. Shrouding Shalya in that battle (with<br>many arrows), Nakula, that slayer of hostile heroes, smiling the while,<br>pierced him in the centre of the chest with ten arrows, made entirely of<br>iron, polished by the hands of the smith, equipped with wings of gold,<br>whetted on stone, and propelled from his bow with great force. Afflicted<br>by his illustrious nephew, Shalya afflicted his nephew in return with<br>many straight arrows. Then king Yudhishthira, and Bhimasena, and Satyaki,<br>and Sahadeva, the son of Madri, all rushed against the ruler of the<br>Madras. The vanquisher of foes, the generalissimo of the Kuru army,<br>received in that battle all those heroes that rushed towards him quickly,<br>filling the cardinal and the subsidiary points of the compass with the<br>rattle of their cars and causing the Earth to tremble therewith. Piercing<br>Yudhishthira with three arrows and Bhima with seven, Shalya pierced<br>Satyaki with a hundred arrows in that battle and Sahadeva with three.<br>Then the ruler of the Madras, O sire, cut off, with a razor-headed arrow,<br>the bow with arrow fixed on it of the high-souled Nakula. Struck with<br>Shalya's shafts, that bow broke into pieces. Taking up another bow,<br>Madri's son, that great car-warrior quickly covered the ruler of the<br>Madras with winged arrows. Then Yudhishthira and Sahadeva, O sire, each<br>pierced the ruler of the Madras with ten arrows in the chest. Bhimasena<br>and Satyaki, rushing at the ruler of the Madras, both struck him with<br>arrows winged with Kanka feathers, the former with sixty, and the latter<br>with nine. Filled with rage at this, the ruler of the Madras pierced<br>Satyaki with nine arrows and once again with seventy straight shafts.<br>Then, O sire, he cut off at the handle the bow, with arrow fixed on it,<br>of Satyaki and then despatched the four steeds of the latter to Yama's<br>abode. Having made Satyaki carless, that mighty car-warrior, the ruler of<br>the Madras, struck him with a hundred arrows from every side. He next<br>pierced two angry sons of Madri, and Bhimasena the son of Pandu, and<br>Yudhishthira, O thou of Kuru's race, with ten arrows each. The prowess<br>that we then beheld of the ruler of the Madras was exceedingly wonderful,<br>since the Parthas, even unitedly, could not approach him in that battle.<br>Riding then upon another car, the mighty Satyaki, of prowess incapable of<br>being baffled, beholding the Pandavas afflicted and succumbing to the<br>ruler of the Madras, rushed with speed against him. That ornament of<br>assemblies, Shalya, on his car, rushed against the car of Satyaki, like<br>one infuriate elephant against another. The collision that then took<br>place between Satyaki and the heroic ruler of the Madras, became fierce<br>and wonderful to behold, even like that which had taken place in days of<br>yore between the Asura Samvara and the chief of the celestials. Beholding<br>the ruler of the Madras staying before him in that battle, Satyaki<br>pierced him with ten arrows and said, "Wait, Wait!" Deeply pierced by<br>that high-souled warrior, the ruler of the Madras pierced Satyaki in<br>return with sharp shafts equipped with beautiful feathers. Those great<br>bowmen then, the Parthas, beholding the king of the Madras assailed by<br>Satyaki, quickly rushed towards him from desire of slaying that maternal<br>uncle of theirs. The encounter then that took place between those<br>struggling heroes, marked by a great flow of blood, became exceedingly<br>awful, like that which takes place between a number of roaring lions. The<br>struggle, O monarch, that took between them resembled that which takes<br>place between a number of roaring lions fighting with each other for<br>meat. With the dense showers of shafts shot by them, the Earth became<br>entirely enveloped, and the welkin also suddenly became one mass of<br>arrows. All around the field a darkness was caused by those arrows.<br>Indeed, with the shafts shot by those illustrious warriors, a shadow as<br>that of the clouds was caused there. Then, O king, with those blazing<br>shafts sped by the warriors, that were equipped with wings of gold and<br>that looked like snakes just freed from their sloughs, the points of the<br>compass seemed to be ablaze. That slayer of foes, Shalya, then achieved<br>the most wonderful feat, since that hero alone, and unsupported,<br>contended with many heroes in that battle. The Earth became shrouded with<br>the fierce shafts, equipped with feathers of Kankas and peacocks, that<br>fell, sped from the arms of the ruler of the Madras. Then, O king, we<br>beheld the car of Shalya careering in that dreadful battle like the car<br>of Shakra in days of yore on the occasion of the destruction of the<br>Asuras.'"
