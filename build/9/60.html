                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Beholding the (Kuru) king struck down unfairly,<br>what O Suta, did the mighty Baladeva, that foremost one of Yadu's race,<br>say? Tell me, O Sanjaya, what Rohini's son, well-skilled in encounters<br>with the mace and well acquainted with all its rules, did on that<br>occasion!'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding thy son struck at the thighs, the mighty Rama,<br>that foremost of smiters, became exceedingly angry. Raising his arms<br>aloft the hero having the plough for his weapon, in a voice of deep<br>sorrow, said in the midst of those kings, "Oh, fie on Bhima, fie on<br>Bhima! Oh, fie, that in such a fair fight a blow hath been struck below<br>the navel! Never before hath such an act as Vrikodara hath done been<br>witnessed in an encounter with the mace! No limb below the navel should<br>be struck. This is the precept laid down in treatises! This Bhima,<br>however, is an ignorant wretch, unacquainted with the truths of<br>treatises! He, therefore, acteth as he likes!" While uttering these<br>words, Rama gave way to great wrath. The mighty Baladeva then, uplifting<br>his plough, rushed towards Bhimasena! The form of that high-souled<br>warrior of uplifted arms then became like that of the gigantic mountains<br>of Kailasa variegated with diverse kinds of metals. The mighty Keshava,<br>however, ever bending with humanity, seized the rushing Rama encircling<br>him with his massive and well-rounded arms. Those two foremost heroes of<br>Yadu's race, the one dark in complexion and the other fair, looked<br>exceedingly beautiful at that moment, like the Sun and the Moon, O king,<br>on the evening sky! For pacifying the angry Rama, Keshava addressed him,<br>saying, "There are six kinds of advancement that a person may have: one's<br>own advancement, the advancement of one's friends, the advancement of<br>one's friends', the decay of one's enemy, the decay of one's enemy's<br>friends, and the decay of one's enemy's friends' friends. When reverses<br>happen to one's own self or to one's friends, one should then understand<br>that one's fall is at hand and, therefore, one should at such times look<br>for the means of applying a remedy. The Pandavas of unsullied prowess are<br>our natural friends. They are the children of our own sire's sister! They<br>had been greatly afflicted by their foes! The accomplishment of one's vow<br>is one's duty. Formerly Bhima had vowed in the midst of the assembly that<br>he would in great battle break with his mace the thighs of Duryodhana.<br>The great Rishi Maitreya also, O scorcher of foes, had formerly cursed<br>Duryodhana, saying, 'Bhima will, with his mace, break thy thighs!' In<br>consequence of all this, I do not see any fault in Bhima! Do not give way<br>to wrath, O slayer of Pralamva! Our relationship with the Pandavas is<br>founded upon birth and blood, as also upon an attraction of hearts. In<br>their growth is our growth. Do not, therefore, give way to wrath, O bull<br>among men!" Hearing these words of Vasudeva the wielder of the plough,<br>who was conversant with rules of morality, said, "Morality is well<br>practised by the good. Morality, however, is always afflicted by two<br>things, the desire of Profit entertained by those that covet it, and the<br>desire for Pleasure cherished by those that are wedded to it. Whoever<br>without afflicting Morality and Profit, or Morality and Pleasure, or<br>Pleasure and Profit, followeth all three&#8212;Morality, Profit and<br>Pleasure&#8212;always succeeds in obtaining great happiness. In consequence,<br>however, of morality being afflicted by Bhimasena, this harmony of which<br>I have spoken hath been disturbed, whatever, O Govinda, thou mayst tell<br>me!" Krishna replied, saying, "Thou art always described as bereft of<br>wrath, and righteous-souled and devoted to righteousness! Calm thyself,<br>therefore, and do not give way to wrath! Know that the Kali age is at<br>hand. Remember also the vow made by the son of Pandu! Let, therefore, the<br>son of Pandu be regarded to have paid off the debt he owed to his<br>hostility and to have fulfilled his vow!"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing this fallacious discourse from Keshava, O<br>king, Rama failed to dispel his wrath and became cheerful. He then said<br>in that assembly, "Having unfairly slain king Suyodhana of righteous<br>soul, the son of Pandu shall be reputed in the world as a crooked<br>warrior! The righteous-souled Duryodhana, on the other hand, shall obtain<br>eternal blessedness! Dhritarashtra's royal son, that ruler of men, who<br>hath been struck down, is a fair warrior. Having made every arrangement<br>for the Sacrifice of battle and having undergone the initiatory<br>ceremonies on the field, and, lastly, having poured his life as a<br>libation upon the fire represented by his foes, Duryodhana has fairly<br>completed his sacrifice by the final ablutions represented by the<br>attainment of glory!" Having said these words, the valiant son of Rohini,<br>looking like the crest of a white cloud, ascended his car and proceeded<br>towards Dwaraka. The Pancalas with the Vrishnis, as also the Pandavas, O<br>monarch, became rather cheerless after Rama had set out for Dwaravati.<br>Then Vasudeva, approaching Yudhishthira who was exceedingly melancholy<br>and filled with anxiety, and who hung down his head and knew not what to<br>do in consequence of his deep affliction, said unto him these words:<br><br>"'Vasudeva said, "O Yudhishthira the just, why dost thou sanction this<br>unrighteous act, since thou permittest the head of the insensible and<br>fallen Duryodhana whose kinsmen and friends have all been slain to be<br>thus struck by Bhima with his foot. Conversant with the ways of morality,<br>why dost thou, O king, witness this act with indifference?"<br><br>"'Yudhishthira answered, "This act, O Krishna, done from wrath, of<br>Vrikodara's touching the head of the king with his foot, is not agreeable<br>to me, nor am I glad at this extermination of my race! By guile were we<br>always deceived by the sons of Dhritarashtra! Many were the cruel words<br>they spoke to us. We were again exiled into the woods by them. Great is<br>the grief on account of all those acts that is in Bhimasena's heart!<br>Reflecting on all this, O thou of Vrishni's race, I looked on with<br>indifference! Having slain the covetous Duryodhana bereft of wisdom and<br>enslaved by his passions, let the son of Pandu gratify his desire, be it<br>righteousness or unrighteousness!"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'After Yudhishthira had said this, Vasudeva, that<br>perpetuator of Yadu's race, said with difficulty, "Let it be so!" Indeed,<br>after Vasudeva had been addressed in those words by Yudhishthira, the<br>former, who, always wished what was agreeable to and beneficial for<br>Bhima, approved all those acts that Bhima had done in battle. Having<br>struck down thy son in battle, the wrathful Bhimasena, his heart filled<br>with joy, stood with joined hands before Yudhishthira and saluted him in<br>proper form. With eyes expanded in delight and proud of the victory he<br>had won, Vrikodara of great energy, O king, addressed his eldest brother,<br>saying, "The Earth is today thine, O king, without brawls to disturb her<br>and with all her thorns removed! Rule over her, O monarch, and observe<br>the duties of thy order! He who was the cause of these hostilities and<br>who fomented them by means of his guile, that wretched wight fond of<br>deception, lieth, struck down, on the bare ground, O lord of earth! All<br>these wretches headed by Duhshasana, who used to utter cruel words, as<br>also those other foes of thine, the son of Radha, and Shakuni, have been<br>slain! Teeming with all kinds of gems, the Earth, with her forests and<br>mountains, O monarch, once more cometh to thee that hast no foes alive!"<br><br>"'Yudhishthira said, "Hostilities have come to an end! King Suyodhana<br>hath been struck down! The earth hath been conquered (by us), ourselves<br>having acted according to the counsels of Krishna! By good luck, thou<br>hast paid off thy debt to thy mother and to thy wrath! By good luck, thou<br>hast been victorious, O invincible hero, and by good luck, thy foe hath<br>been slain!"'"
