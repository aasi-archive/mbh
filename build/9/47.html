                            Janamejaya said, "This history, O regenerate one, that I have heard from<br>thee is exceedingly wonderful, this narration, in detail, of the<br>installation, according to due rites, of Skanda. O thou possessed of<br>wealth of asceticism, I deem myself cleansed by having listened to this<br>account. My hair stands on end and my mind hath become cheerful. Having<br>heard the history of the installation of Kumara and the destruction of<br>the Daityas, great hath been my joy. I feel a curiosity, however, in<br>respect of another matter. How was the Lord of the waters installed by<br>the celestials in that tirtha in days of yore? O best of men, tell me<br>that, for thou art possessed of great wisdom and art skilled in<br>narration!"<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "Listen, O king, to this wonderful history of what<br>transpired truly in a former Kalpa! In days of yore, in the Krita age, O<br>king, all celestials, duly approaching Varuna, said unto him these words,<br>'As Shakra, the Lord of the celestials, always protects us from every<br>fear, similarly be thou the Lord of all the rivers! Thou always residest,<br>O god, in the Ocean, that home of makaras! This Ocean, the lord of<br>rivers, will then be under thy dominion! Thou shalt then wax and wane<br>with Soma!' (Thus addressed) Varuna answered them, saying, 'Let it be<br>so!' All the celestials then, assembling together, made Varuna having his<br>abode in the ocean the Lord of all the waters, according to the rites<br>laid down in the scriptures. Having installed Varuna as the Lord of all<br>aquatic creatures and worshipping him duly, the celestials returned to<br>their respective abodes. Installed by the celestials, the illustrious<br>Varuna began to duly protect seas and lakes and rivers and other<br>reservoirs of water as Shakra protects the gods. Bathing in that tirtha<br>also and giving away diverse kinds of gifts, Baladeva, the slayer of<br>Pralamva, possessed of great wisdom, then proceeded to Agnitirtha, that<br>spot where the eater of clarified butter, disappearing from the view,<br>became concealed within the entrails of the Sami wood. When the light of<br>all the worlds thus disappeared, O sinless one, the gods then repaired to<br>the Grandsire of the universe. And they said, 'The adorable Agni has<br>disappeared. We do not know the reason. Let not all creatures be<br>destroyed. Create fire, O puissant Lord!'"<br><br>Janamejaya said, "For what reason did Agni, the Creator of all the<br>worlds, disappear? How also was he discovered by the gods? Tell me all<br>this in detail."<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "Agni of great energy became very much frightened at<br>the curse of Bhrigu. Concealing himself within the entrails of the Sami<br>wood, that adorable god disappeared from the view. Upon the disappearance<br>of Agni, all the gods, with Vasava at their head, in great affliction,<br>searched for the missing god. Finding Agni then, they saw that god lying<br>within the entrails of the Sami wood. The celestials, O tiger among king,<br>with Brihaspati at their head, having succeeded in finding out the god,<br>became very glad with Vasava amongst them. They then returned to the<br>places they had come from. Agni also, from Bhrigu's curse, became an<br>eater of everything, as Bhrigu, that utterer of Brahma, had said. The<br>intelligent Balarama, having bathed there, then proceeded to Brahmayoni<br>where the adorable Grandsire of all the worlds had exercised his<br>functions of creations. In days of yore, the Lord Brahman, along with all<br>the gods, bathed in that tirtha, according to due rites for the<br>celestials. Bathing there and giving away diverse kinds of gifts,<br>Valadeva then proceeded to the tirtha called Kauvera where the puissant<br>Ailavila, having practised severe austerities, obtained, O king, the<br>Lordship over all treasures. While he dwelt there (engaged in<br>austerities), all kinds of wealth, and all the precious gems came to him<br>of their own accord. Baladeva having repaired to that tirtha and bathed<br>in its waters duly gave much wealth unto the Brahamanas. Rama beheld at<br>that spot the excellent woods of Kuvera. In days of yore, the high-souled<br>Kuvera, the chief of the Yakshas, having practised the severest<br>austerities there, obtained many boons. There were the lordship of all<br>treasures, the friendship of Rudra possessed of immeasurable energy, the<br>status of a god, the regency over a particular point of the compass (the<br>north), and a son named Nakakuvera. These the chief of the Yakshas<br>speedily obtained there, O thou of mighty arms! The Maruts, coming there,<br>installed him duly (in his sovereignty). He also obtained for a vehicle a<br>well-equipped and celestial car, fleet as thought, as also all the<br>affluence of a god. Bathing in that tirtha and giving away much wealth,<br>Vala using white unguents thence proceeded quickly to another tirtha.<br>Populous with all kinds of creatures, that tirtha is known by the name<br>Vadarapachana. There the fruits of every season are always to be found<br>and flowers and fruits of every kind are always abundant."
