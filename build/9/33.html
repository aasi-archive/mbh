                            "Sanjaya said, 'Whilst Duryodhana, O king, was repeatedly roaring in this<br>strain, Vasudeva, filled with wrath, said these words unto Yudhishthira,<br>"What rash words hast thou spoken, O king, to the effect, 'Slaying one<br>amongst us be thou king among the Kurus.' If, indeed, O Yudhishthira,<br>Duryodhana select thee for battle, or Arjuna, or Nakula, or Sahadeva<br>(what will be the consequence)? From desire of slaying Bhimasena, O king,<br>for these thirteen years hath Duryodhana practised with the mace upon a<br>statue of iron! How then, O bull of Bharata's race, will our purpose be<br>achieved? From compassion, O best of kings, thou hast acted with great<br>rashness! I do not at this moment behold a match (for Duryodhana) except<br>Pritha's son Vrikodara! His practice, again, with the mace, is not so<br>great! Thou hast, therefore, once more allowed a wretched game of chance<br>to commence as that one in former days between thyself and Shakuni, O<br>monarch! Bhima is possessed of might and prowess. King Suyodhana,<br>however, is possessed of skill! In a contest between might and skill, he<br>that is possessed of skill, O king, always prevails! Such a foe, O king,<br>thou hast, by thy words, placed in a position of ease and comfort! Thou<br>hast placed thine own self, however, in a position of difficulty. We<br>have, in consequence of this, been placed in great danger! Who is there<br>that would abandon sovereignty within grasp, after having vanquished all<br>his foes and when he hath only one foe to dispose of and that one plunged<br>in difficulties? I do not see that man in the world today, be he a god,<br>who is competent to vanquish the mace-armed Duryodhana in battle! Neither<br>thou nor Bhima, nor Nakula nor Sahadeva, nor Phalguna, is capable of<br>vanquishing Duryodhana in fair fight! King Duryodhana is possessed of<br>great skill! How then, O Bharata, canst thou say unto such a foe words<br>such as these, 'Fight, selecting the mace as thy weapon, and if thou<br>canst slay one amongst us, thou shalt then be king?' If Duryodhana<br>encounters Vrikodara amongst us wishing to fight fairly with him, even<br>then our victory would be doubtful. Duryodhana is possessed of great<br>might and great skill. How couldst thou say unto him, 'Slaying only one<br>amongst us be thou king'? Without a doubt, the offspring of Pandu and<br>Kunti are not destined to enjoy sovereignty! They were born for passing<br>their lives in continued exile in the woods or in mendicancy!"<br><br>"'Bhimasena said, "O slayer of Madhu, do not, O delighter of the Yadus,<br>give way to sorrow! However, difficult to reach it, I shall today reach<br>the end of these hostilities! Without doubt, I shall slay Suyodhana in<br>battle! It appears, O Krishna, that the victory of Yudhishthira the just<br>is certain! This mace of mine is heavier than Duryodhana's by one and a<br>half times! Do not, O Madhava, give way to grief! I dare fight him,<br>selecting the mace as the weapon! Let all of you, O Janardana, stand as<br>spectators of the encounter! What do you say of Suyodhana, I would fight<br>with the three worlds including the very gods, even if they be armed with<br>every kind of weapon!"'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'After Vrikodara had said these words, Vasudeva,<br>filled with joy, applauded him highly and said unto him, "Relying on<br>thee, O thou of mighty arms, king Yudhishthira the just will, without<br>doubt, get back his own blazing prosperity after the slaughter of all his<br>foes! Thou hast slain all the sons of Dhritarashtra in battle! At thy<br>hands many kings and princes and elephants have met with their fate! The<br>Kalingas, the Magadhas, the Kauravas the Westerners, the Gandharas have<br>all been slain in dreadful battle, O son of Pandu! Slaying Duryodhana<br>then, O son of Kunti, bestow the earth with her oceans upon Yudhishthira<br>the just, like Vishnu (conferring the sovereignty of three worlds) upon<br>the Lord of Sachi! The wretched son of Dhritarashtra, obtaining thee for<br>a foe in battle, will, without doubt, meet with his fate! Thou wilt<br>certainly accomplish thy vow by breaking his bones! Thou shouldst,<br>however, O son of Pritha, always fight with care with the son of<br>Dhritarashtra! He is possessed of both skill and strength and always<br>takes delight in battle!" Then Satyaki, O king, applauded the son of<br>Pandu. The Pancalas and the Pandavas, also, headed by king Yudhishthira<br>the just, all applauded those words of Bhimasena. Then Bhima of terrible<br>might addressed Yudhishthira, who was staying amid the Srinjayas like the<br>blazing sun himself, saying, "Encountering this one in battle, I venture<br>to fight with him! This wretch among men is not competent to vanquish me<br>in fight! Today I shall vomit that wrath which hath been nursed in my<br>bosom upon Suyodhana, the son of Dhritarashtra, like Arjuna throwing fire<br>on the forest of Khandava! I shall today pluck out the dart, O son of<br>Pandu, that lay so long sticking to thy heart! Be happy, O king, after I<br>shall have laid low this wretch with my mace! Today I shall recover, O<br>sinless one, thy wreath of glory! Today Suyodhana shall abandon his life<br>breath, his prosperity, and his kingdom! Today king Dhritarashtra also,<br>hearing of his son's slaughter, will remember all those wrongs (that he<br>did unto us) arising from the suggestions of Shakuni!" Having said these<br>words that prince of Bharata's race, possessed of great energy, stood up<br>for battle, like Shakra summoning Vritra (to an encounter). Unable to<br>endure that summons, thy son, of great energy, proceeded to the<br>encounter, like one infuriated elephant proceeding to assail another. The<br>Pandavas beheld thy son, as he came armed with mace, look like the<br>crested mountain of Kailasa. Indeed, seeing that mighty son of thine<br>standing alone like a prince of elephants separated from the herd, the<br>Pandavas became filled with delight. Standing in battle like a very lion,<br>Duryodhana had no fear, no alarm, no pain, no anxiety. Beholding him<br>stand there with uplifted mace like the crested mountain of Kailasa,<br>Bhimasena, O monarch, addressed him, saying, "Call to thy mind all those<br>wrongs that king Dhritarashtra and thyself have done unto us! Recollect<br>what happened at Varanavata! Recollect how Draupadi, while in her season,<br>was maltreated in the midst of the assembly and how king Yudhishthira was<br>defeated at dice through Shakuni's suggestion! See now, O thou of wicked<br>soul, the terrible consequence of those acts as also of the other wrongs<br>that thou didst unto the innocent Parthas! It is for thee that that<br>illustrious chief of the Bharatas, the son of Ganga, the grandsire of us<br>all, lieth now on a bed of arrows, struck down (by us)! Drona also hath<br>been slain! Karna hath been slain! Shalya of great valour hath been<br>slain! Yonder Shakuni also, the root of these hostilities, hath been<br>slain in battle! Thy heroic brothers, as also thy sons, with all thy<br>troops, have been slain! Other kings also, possessed of heroism, and<br>never retreating from battle, have been slain. These and many other bulls<br>among Kshatriyas, as also the Pratikamin, that wretch who had seized the<br>tresses of Draupadi, have been slain! Thou alone art still alive, thou<br>exterminator of thy race, thou wretch among men! Thee also I shall today<br>slay with my mace! Of this there is no doubt! Today, O king, I shall, in<br>battle, quell all thy pride! I shall destroy also thy hope of<br>sovereignty, O king, and pay off all thy misdeeds unto the sons of Pandu!"<br><br>"'Duryodhana said, "What use is there of many words? Fight now with me!<br>Today, O Vrikodara, I shall beat out of thee thy desire for battle! Why<br>dost thou not behold me, O wretch, standing here for an encounter with<br>the mace? Am I not armed with a formidable mace that looks like a cliff<br>of Himavat? What foe is there, O wretch, that would venture to vanquish<br>me armed with this weapon? If it be a fair fight, Purandara himself,<br>amongst the gods, is not competent for that end! For all those wicked<br>deeds of mine to which thou hast referred, thou couldst not (hitherto) do<br>me the slightest injury! By exercising my might, I caused ye to dwell in<br>the woods, to serve in another's dwelling, to conceal yourselves in<br>disguises! Your friends and allies also have been slain. Our loss has<br>been equal! If, then my fall takes place in this battle, that would be<br>highly praiseworthy. Or, perhaps, Time will be the cause! Up to this day<br>I have never been vanquished in fair fight on the field of battle! If you<br>vanquish me by deceit, your infamy will certainly last for ever! That act<br>of yours will, without doubt, be unrighteous and infamous! Do not, O son<br>of Kunti, roar fruitlessly in this way like autumnal clouds uncharged<br>with water! Show all the strength thou hast in battle now!" Hearing these<br>words of his, the Pandavas with the Srinjayas, all inspired with desire<br>of victory, applauded them highly. Like men exciting an infuriated<br>elephant with clapping of hands, all of them then gladdened king<br>Duryodhana (with those praises and cheers). The elephants that were there<br>began to grunt and the steeds to neigh repeatedly. The weapons of the<br>Pandavas, who were inspired with desire of victory blazed forth of their<br>own accord.'"
