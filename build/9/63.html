                            Janamejaya said, "For what reason did that tiger among kings,<br>Yudhishthira the just, despatch that scorcher of foes, Vasudeva, unto<br>Gandhari? Krishna had at first gone to the Kauravas for the sake of<br>bringing about peace. He did not obtain the fruition of his wishes. In<br>consequence of this the battle took place. When all the warriors were<br>slain and Duryodhana was struck down, when in consequence of the battle<br>the empire of Pandu's son became perfectly foeless, when all the (Kuru)<br>camp became empty, all its inmates having fled, when great renown was won<br>by the son of Pandu, what, O regenerate one, was the cause for which<br>Krishna had once again to go to Hastinapura? It seems to me, O Brahmana,<br>that the cause could not be a light one, for it was Janardana of<br>immeasurable soul who had himself to make the journey! O foremost of all<br>Adhyaryus, tell me in detail what the cause was for undertaking such a<br>mission!"<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "The question thou askest me, O king, is, indeed,<br>worthy of thee! I will tell thee everything truly as it occurred, O bull<br>of Bharata's race! Beholding Duryodhana, the mighty son of Dhritarashtra,<br>struck down by Bhimasena in contravention of the rules of fair fight, in<br>fact, beholding the Kuru king slain unfairly, O Bharata, Yudhishthira, O<br>monarch, became filled with great fear, at the thought of the highly<br>blessed Gandhari possessed of ascetic merit. "She hath undergone severe<br>ascetic austerities and can, therefore, consume the three worlds," even<br>thus thought the son of Pandu. By sending Krishna, Gandhari, blazing with<br>wrath, would be comforted before Yudhishthira's own arrival. "Hearing of<br>the death of her son brought to such a plight by ourselves, she will, in<br>wrath, with the fire of her mind, reduce us to ashes! How will Gandhari<br>endure such poignant grief, after she hears her son, who always fought<br>fairly, slain unfairly by us?" Having reflected in this strain for a long<br>while, king Yudhishthira the just, filled with fear and grief, said these<br>words unto Vasudeva: "Through thy grace, O Govinda, my kingdom hath been<br>reft of thorns! That which we could not in imagination even aspire to<br>obtain hath now become ours, O thou of unfading glory! Before my eyes, O<br>mighty-armed one, making the very hair stand on end, violent were the<br>blows that thou hadst to bear, O delighter of the Yadavas! In the battle<br>between the gods and the Asuras, thou hadst, in days of old, lent thy aid<br>for the destruction of the foes of the gods and those foes were slain! In<br>the same way, O mighty-armed one, thou hast given us aid, O thou of<br>unfading glory! By agreeing to act as our charioteer, O thou of Vrishni's<br>race, thou hast all along protected us! If thou hadst not been the<br>protector of Phalguna in dreadful battle, how could then this sea of<br>troops have been capable of being vanquished? Many were the blows of the<br>mace, and many were the strokes of spiked bludgeons and darts and sharp<br>arrows and lances and battle axes, that have been endured by thee! For<br>our sake, O Krishna, thou hadst also to hear many harsh words and endure<br>the fall, violent as the thunder, of weapons in battle! In consequence of<br>Duryodhana's slaughter, all this has not been fruitless, O thou of<br>unfading glory! Act thou again in such a way that the fruit of all those<br>acts may not be destroyed! Although victory hath been ours, O Krishna,<br>our heart, however, is yet trembling in doubt! Know, O Madhava, that<br>Gandhari's wrath, O mighty-armed one, hath been provoked! That<br>highly-blessed lady is always emaciating herself with the austerest of<br>penances! Hearing of the slaughter of her sons and grandsons, she will,<br>without doubt, consume us to ashes! It is time, O hero, I think, for<br>pacifying her! Except thee, O foremost of men, what other person is there<br>that is able to even behold that lady of eyes red like copper in wrath<br>and exceedingly afflicted with the ills that have befallen her children?<br>That thou shouldst go there, O Madhava, is what I think to be proper, for<br>pacifying Gandhari, O chastiser of foes, who is blazing with wrath! Thou<br>art the Creator and the Destroyer. Thou art the first cause of all the<br>worlds thyself being eternal! By words fraught with reasons, visible and<br>invisible that are all the result of time, thou wilt quickly, O thou of<br>great wisdom, be able to pacify Gandhari! Our grandsire, thy holy<br>Krishna-Dvaipayana, will be there. O mighty-armed one, it is thy duty to<br>dispel, by all means in thy power, the wrath of Gandhari!" Hearing these<br>words of king Yudhishthira the just, the perpetuator of Yadu's race,<br>summoning Daruka, said, "Let my car be equipped!" Having received<br>Keshava's command, Daruka in great haste, returned and represented unto<br>his high-souled master that the car was ready. That scorcher of foes and<br>chief of Yadu's race, the lord Keshava, having mounted the car, proceeded<br>with great haste to the city of the Kurus. The adorable Madhava then,<br>riding on his vehicle, proceeded, and arriving at the city called after<br>the elephant entered it. Causing the city to resound with the rattle of<br>his car-wheels as he entered it, he sent word to Dhritarashtra and then<br>alighted from his vehicle and entered the palace of the old king. He<br>there beheld that best of Rishis, (Dvaipayana) arrived before him.<br>Janardana, embracing the feet of both Vyasa and Dhritarashtra, quietly<br>saluted Gandhari also. Then the foremost of the Yadavas, Vishnu seizing<br>Dhritarashtra by the hand, O monarch, began to weep melodiously. Having<br>shed tears for a while from sorrow, he washed his eyes and his face with<br>water according to rules. That chastiser of foes then said these softly<br>flowing words unto Dhritarashtra, "Nothing is unknown to thee, O Bharata,<br>about the past and the future! Thou art well-acquainted, O lord, with the<br>course of time! From a regard for thee, the Pandavas had endeavoured to<br>prevent the destruction of their race and the extermination of<br>Kshatriyas, O Bharata! Having made an understanding with his brothers,<br>the virtuous Yudhishthira had lived peacefully. He even went to exile<br>after defeat at unfair dice! With his brothers he led a life of<br>concealment, attired in various disguises. They also every day got into<br>diverse other woes as if they were quite helpless! On the eve of battle I<br>myself came and in the presence of all men begged of thee only five<br>villages. Afflicted by Time, and moved by covetousness, thou didst not<br>grant my request. Through thy fault, O king, all the Kshatriya race hath<br>been exterminated! Bhishma, and Somadatta, and Valhika, and Kripa, and<br>Drona and his son, and the wise Vidura, always solicited thee for peace.<br>Thou didst not, however, follow their counsels! Everyone, it seems, when<br>afflicted by Time, is stupefied, O Bharata, since even thou, O king, as<br>regards this matter, did act so foolishly! What else can it be but the<br>effect of Time? Indeed, Destiny is supreme! Do not, O thou of great<br>wisdom, impute any fault to the Pandavas! The smallest transgression is<br>not discernible in the high-souled Pandavas, judged by the rules of<br>morality or reason or affection, O scorcher of foes! Knowing all this to<br>be the fruit of thy own fault, it behoveth thee not to cherish any<br>ill-feeling towards the Pandavas! Race, line, funeral cake, and what else<br>depends upon offspring, now depend on the Pandavas as regards both<br>thyself and Gandhari! Thyself, O tiger among the Kurus, and the renowned<br>Gandhari also, should not harbour malice towards the Pandavas. Reflecting<br>upon all this, and thinking also of thy own transgressions, cherish good<br>feeling towards the Pandavas, I bow to thee, O bull of Bharata's race!<br>Thou knowest, O mighty-armed one, what the devotion is of king<br>Yudhishthira and what his affection is towards thee, O tiger among kings!<br>Having caused this slaughter of even foes that wronged him so, he is<br>burning day and night, and hath not succeeded in obtaining peace of mind!<br>That tiger among men, grieving for thee and for Gandhari, faileth to<br>obtain any happiness. Overwhelmed with shame he cometh not before thee<br>that art burning with grief on account of thy children and whose<br>understanding and senses have been agitated by that grief!" Having said<br>these words unto Dhritarashtra, that foremost one of Yadu's race, O<br>monarch, addressed the grief-stricken Gandhari in these words of high<br>import: "O daughter of Subala, thou of excellent vows, listen to what I<br>say! O auspicious dame, there is now no lady like thee in the world! Thou<br>rememberest, O queen, those words that thou spokest in the assembly in my<br>presence, those words fraught with righteousness and that were beneficial<br>to both parties, which thy sons, O auspicious lady, did not obey!<br>Duryodhana who coveted victory was addressed by thee in bitter words!<br>Thou toldst him then. 'Listen, O fool, to these words of mine: "thither<br>is victory where righteousness is."' Those words of thine, O princess,<br>have now been accomplished! Knowing all this, O auspicious lady, do not<br>set thy heart on sorrow. Let not thy heart incline towards the<br>destruction of the Pandavas! In consequence of the strength of thy<br>penances, thou art able, O highly blessed one, to burn, with thy eyes<br>kindled with rage, the whole Earth with her mobile and immobile<br>creatures!" Hearing these words of Vasudeva, Gandhari said, "It is even<br>so, O Keshava, as thou sayest! My heart, burning in grief, has been<br>unsteadied! After hearing thy words, however, that heart, O Janardana,<br>hath again become steady. As regards the blind old king, now become<br>child, thou, O foremost of men, with those heroes, the sons of Pandu,<br>hast become his refuge!" Having said so much, Gandhari, burning in grief<br>on account of the death of her sons, covered her face with her cloth and<br>began to weep aloud. The mighty-armed lord Keshava then comforted the<br>grief-stricken princess with words that were fraught with reasons drawn<br>from visible instances. Having comforted Gandhari and Dhritarashtra,<br>Keshava of Madhu's race came to know (by intuition) the evil that was<br>meditated by Drona's son. Rising up in haste after worshipping the feet<br>of Vyasa bending his head, Keshava, O monarch, addressed Dhritarashtra,<br>saying, "I take my leave, O foremost one of Kuru's race! Do not set thy<br>heart on grief! The son of Drona bears an evil purpose. It is for this<br>that I rise so suddenly! It seems that he has formed a plan of destroying<br>the Pandavas during the night!" Hearing these words, both Gandhari and<br>Dhritarashtra said unto Keshava that slayer of Keshi, these words: "Go,<br>quickly, O mighty-armed one, protect the Pandavas! Let me soon meet thee<br>again, O Janardana!" Then Keshava of unfading glory proceeded with<br>Daruka. After Vasudeva had departed, O king, Vyasa, that adored of the<br>whole world, of inconceivable soul, began to comfort king Dhritarashtra.<br>The righteous-souled Vasudeva departed, having achieved his mission<br>successfully, from Hastinapura, for seeing the camp and the Pandavas.<br>Arrived at the camp, he proceeded to the presence of the Pandavas.<br>Telling them everything (about his mission to the city), he took his seat<br>with them."
