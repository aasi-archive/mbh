                            "Sanjaya said, 'Having heard of Duryodhana's fall from the messengers,<br>those mighty car-warriors, the unslain remnant of the Kaurava army,<br>exceedingly wounded with keen shafts, and maces and lances and darts,<br>those three, Ashvatthama and Kripa and Kritavarma of the Satwata race,<br>came quickly on their fleet steeds to the field of battle. They beheld<br>there the high-souled son of Dhritarashtra prostrate on the ground like a<br>gigantic Sala tree laid low in the forest by a tempest. They beheld him<br>writhing on the bare ground and covered with blood even like a mighty<br>elephant in the forest laid low by a hunter. They saw him weltering in<br>agony and bathed in profuse streams of blood. Indeed, they saw him lying<br>on the ground like the sun dropped on the earth or like the ocean dried<br>by a mighty wind, or like the full Moon in the firmament with his disc<br>shrouded by a fog. Equal to an elephant in prowess and possessed of long<br>arms, the king lay on the earth, covered with dust. Around him were many<br>terrible creatures and carnivorous animals like wealth-coveting<br>dependants around a monarch in state. His forehead was contracted into<br>furrows of rage and his eyes were rolling in wrath. They beheld the king,<br>that tiger among men, full of rage, like a tiger struck down (by<br>hunters). Those great archers Kripa and others, beholding the monarch<br>laid low on the Earth, became stupefied. Alighting from their cars, they<br>ran towards the king. Seeing Duryodhana, all of them sat on the earth<br>around him. Then Drona's son, O monarch, with tearful eyes and breathing<br>like a snake, said these words unto that chief of Bharata's race, that<br>foremost of all the kings on earth, "Truly, there is nothing stable in<br>the world of men, since thou, O tiger among men, liest on the bare earth,<br>stained with dust! Thou wert a king who had laid thy commands on the<br>whole Earth! Why then, O foremost of monarchs, dost thou lie alone on the<br>bare ground in such a lonely wilderness? I do not see Duhshasana beside<br>thee, nor the great car-warrior Karna, nor those friends of thine<br>numbering in hundreds! What is this, O bull among men? Without doubt, it<br>is difficult to learn the ways of Yama, since thou, O lord of all the<br>worlds, thus liest on the bare ground, stained with dust! Alas, this<br>scorcher of foes used to walk at the head of all Kshatriyas that had<br>their locks sprinkled with holy water at ceremonies of coronation! Alas,<br>he now eateth the dust! Behold the reverses that Time bringeth on its<br>course! Where is that pure white umbrella of thine? Where is that fanning<br>yak-tail also, O king? Where hath that vast army of thine now gone, O<br>best of monarchs? The course of events is certainly a mystery when causes<br>other than those relied upon are at book, since even thou that wert the<br>master of the world hast been reduced to this plight! Without doubt, the<br>prosperity of all mortals is very unstable, since thou that wert equal<br>unto Shakra himself hast now been reduced to such a sorry plight!"<br>Hearing these words of the sorrowing Ashvatthama, thy son answered him in<br>these words that were suited to the occasion. He wiped his eyes with his<br>hands and shed tears of grief anew. The king then addressed all those<br>heroes headed by Kripa and said, "This liability to death (of all living<br>creatures) is said to have been ordained by the Creator himself. Death<br>comes to all beings in course of time. That death hath now come to me,<br>before the eyes of you all! I who reigned over the whole earth have now<br>been reduced to this plight! By good luck, I never turned back from<br>battle whatever calamities overtook me. By good luck, I have been slain<br>by those sinful men, by the aid particularly of deception. By good luck,<br>while engaged in hostilities, I always displayed courage and<br>perseverance. By good luck, I am slain in battle, along with all my<br>kinsmen and friends. By good luck, I behold you escaped with life from<br>this great slaughter, and safe and sound. This is highly agreeable to me.<br>Do not, from affection, grieve for my death. If the Vedas are any<br>authority, I have certainly acquired many eternal regions! I am not<br>ignorant of the glory of Krishna of immeasurable energy. He hath not<br>caused me to fall off from the proper observance of Kshatriya duties. I<br>have obtained him. On no account should anybody grieve from me. Ye have<br>done what persons like ye should do. Ye have always striven for my<br>success. Destiny, however, is incapable of being frustrated." Having said<br>this much, the king, with eyes laved with tears, became silent, O<br>monarch, agitated as he was with agony. Beholding the king in tears and<br>grief, Drona's son flamed up in anger like the fire that is seen at the<br>universal destruction. Overwhelmed with rage, he squeezed his hand and<br>addressing the king in a voice hoarse with tears, he said these words,<br>"My sire was slain by those wretches with a cruel contrivance. That act,<br>however, doth not burn me so keenly as this plight to which thou hast<br>been reduced, O king! Listen to these words of mine that I utter,<br>swearing by Truth itself, O lord, and by all my acts of piety, all my<br>gifts, my religion, and the religious merits I have won. I shall today,<br>in the very presence of Vasudeva, despatch all the Pancalas, by all means<br>in my power, to the abode of Yama? It behoveth thee, O monarch, to grant<br>me permission!" Hearing these words of Drona's son, that were highly<br>agreeable to his heart, the Kuru king addressing Kripa, said, "O<br>preceptor, bring me without delay a pot full of water!" At these words of<br>the king, that foremost of Brahmanas soon brought a vessel full of water<br>and approached the king. Thy son then, O monarch, said unto Kripa, "Let<br>the son of Drona, O foremost of Brahmanas, (blessed be thou), be at my<br>command installed as generalissimo, if thou wishest to do me the good! At<br>the command of the king, even a Brahmana may fight, specially one that<br>has adopted Kshatriya practices! Those learned in the scriptures say<br>this!" Hearing these words of the king, Kripa, the son of Saradwat,<br>installed Drona's son as generalissimo, at the king's command! The<br>installation over, O monarch, Ashvatthama embraced that best of kings and<br>left the spot, having caused the ten points to resound with his leonine<br>roars. That foremost of kings, Duryodhana, profusely covered with blood,<br>began to pass there that night so frightful to all creatures. Wending<br>away quickly from the field of battle, O king, those heroes, with hearts<br>agitated by grief, began to reflect anxiously and earnestly.'"<br><br>The End of Shalya-parv
