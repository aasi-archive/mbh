                            "Sanjaya said, 'Dhananjaya, with his Gandiva, frustrated the purpose of<br>those unreturning heroes struggling in battle and striking their foes.<br>The shafts shot by Arjuna, irresistible and endued with great force and<br>whose touch was like that of the thunder, were seen to resemble torrents<br>of rain poured by a cloud. That army, O chief of the Bharatas, thus<br>struck by Kiritin, fled away in the very sight of thy son. Some deserted<br>their sires and brothers, others deserted their comrades. Some<br>car-warriors were deprived of their animals. Others lost their drivers.<br>Some had their poles or yokes or wheels broken, O king! The arrows of<br>some were exhausted. Some were seen afflicted with arrows. Some, though<br>unwounded, fled in a body, afflicted with fear. Some endeavoured to<br>rescue their sons, having lost all their kinsmen and animals. Some loudly<br>called upon their sires, some upon their comrades and followers. Some<br>fled, deserting their kinsmen, O tiger among men, and brothers and other<br>relatives, O monarch! Many mighty car-warriors, struck with Partha's<br>shafts and deeply pierced therewith, were seen to breathe hard, deprived<br>of their senses. Others, taking them upon their own cars, and soothing<br>them for a while, and resting them and dispelling their thirst by<br>offering them drink, once more proceeded to battle. Some, incapable of<br>being easily defeated in battle, deserting the wounded, once more<br>advanced to battle, desirous of obeying the behests of thy son. Some,<br>having slaked their thirst or groomed their animals, and some, wearing<br>(fresh) armour, O chief of the Bharatas, and some, having comforted their<br>brothers and sons and sires, and placed them in camp, once more came to<br>battle. Some, arraying their cars in the order, O king, of superiors and<br>inferiors, advanced against the Pandavas once more for battle. Those<br>heroes (on their cars) covered with rows of bells, looked resplendent<br>like Daityas and Danavas intent on the conquest of the three worlds.<br>Some, advancing with precipitancy on their vehicles decked with gold,<br>fought with Dhrishtadyumna amid the Pandava divisions. The Pancala prince<br>Dhrishtadyumna, and the great car-warrior Shikhandi, and Satanika, the<br>son of Nakula, fought with the car-force of the enemy. The Pancala<br>prince, then, filled with rage and supported by a large army, rushed<br>against thy angry troops from desire of slaying them. Then thy son, O<br>ruler of men, sped many showers of arrows, O Bharata, at the Pancala<br>prince thus rushing at him. Then, O king, Dhrishtadyumna was quickly<br>pierced with many arrows in his arms and chest by thy son fighting with<br>his bow. Deeply pierced therewith like an elephant with pointed lances,<br>that great bowman then despatched with his shafts the four steeds of<br>Duryodhana to the regions of death. With another broad-headed arrow he<br>next cut off from his trunk the head of his enemy's driver. Then that<br>chastiser of foes, king Duryodhana, having thus lost his car, rode on<br>horse-back and retreated to a spot not remote. Beholding his own army<br>destitute of prowess, thy son, the mighty Duryodhana, O king, proceeded<br>to the place where Subala's son was. When the Kaurava cars were broken,<br>3,000 gigantic elephants encompassed those car-warriors, the five<br>Pandavas. Encompassed by that elephant force, O Bharata, the five<br>brothers looked beautiful, O tiger among men, like the planets surrounded<br>by the clouds. Then the mighty-armed and white-steeded Arjuna, O king, of<br>sureness of aim and having Krishna for his charioteer, advanced on his<br>car. Surrounded by those elephants huge as hills, he began to destroy<br>those animals with his keen and polished arrows. Each slain with a single<br>arrow, we beheld those huge elephants fallen or falling down, mangled by<br>Savyasaci. The mighty Bhimasena, himself like an infuriated elephant,<br>beholding those elephants, took up his formidable mace and rushed at<br>them, quickly jumping down from his car, like the Destroyer armed with<br>his club. Seeing that great car-warrior of the Pandavas with uplifted<br>mace, thy soldiers became filled with fright and passed urine and<br>excreta. The whole army became agitated upon beholding Bhimasena armed<br>with mace. We then beheld those elephants, huge as hills, running hither<br>and thither, with their frontal globes split open by Bhima with his mace<br>and all their limbs bathed in blood. Struck with Bhima's mace, those<br>elephants, running off from him, fell down with cries of pain, like<br>wingless mountains. Beholding those elephants, many in number, with their<br>frontal globes split open, running hither and thither or falling down,<br>thy soldiers were inspired with fear. Then Yudhishthira also, filled with<br>wrath, and the two sons of Madri, began to slay those elephant-warriors<br>with arrows equipped with vulturine wings. Dhrishtadyumna, after the<br>defeat of the (Kuru) king in battle, and after the flight of the latter<br>from that spot on horse-back, saw that the Pandavas had all been<br>surrounded by the (Kaurava) elephants. Beholding this, O monarch,<br>Dhrishtadyumna, the son of the Pancala king, proceeded towards those<br>elephants, from desire of slaughtering them. Meanwhile, not seeing<br>Duryodhana in the midst of the car-force. Ashvatthama and Kripa, and<br>Kritavarma of the Satwata race, asked all the Kshatriyas there, saying,<br>'Where has Duryodhana gone?' Not seeing the king in that carnage, those<br>great car-warriors all thought thy son to have been slain. Hence, with<br>sorrowful faces, they enquired after him. Some persons told them that<br>after the fall of his driver, he had gone to Subala's son. Other<br>Kshatriyas, present there, who had been exceedingly mangled with wounds,<br>said, "What need is there with Duryodhana? See if he is yet alive! Do you<br>all fight unitedly? What will the king do to you?" Other Kshatriyas, who<br>were exceedingly mangled, who had lost many of their kinsmen, and who<br>were still being afflicted with the arrows of the enemy, said these words<br>in indistinct tones, "Let us slay these forces by whom we are<br>encompassed! Behold, the Pandavas are coming hither, after having slain<br>the elephants!" Hearing these words of theirs, the mighty Ashvatthama,<br>piercing through that irresistible force of the Pancala king, proceeded<br>with Kripa and Kritavarma to the spot where Subala's son was. Indeed,<br>those heroes, those firm bowmen, leaving the car-force, repaired (in<br>search of Duryodhana). After they had gone away, the Pandavas, headed by<br>Dhrishtadyumna, advanced, O king, and began to slay their enemies.<br>Beholding those valiant and heroic and mighty car-warriors cheerfully<br>rushing towards them, thy troops, amongst whom the faces of many had<br>turned pale, became hopeless of their lives. Seeing those soldiers of<br>ours almost deprived of weapons and surrounded (by the foe). I myself, O<br>king, having only two kinds of forces, and becoming reckless of life,<br>joined the five leaders of our army, and fought with the forces of the<br>Pancala prince, posting our men on that spot where Saradwat's son was<br>stationed. We had been afflicted with the shafts of Kiritin.<br>Nevertheless, a fierce battle took place between us and the division of<br>Dhrishtadyumna. At last, vanquished by the latter, all of us retreated<br>from that encounter. I then beheld the mighty car-warrior Satyaki rushing<br>against us. With four hundred cars that hero pursued me in battle. Having<br>escaped with difficulty from Dhrishtadyumna whose steeds had been tired,<br>I fell among the forces of Madhava even as a sinner falleth into hell.<br>There a fierce and terrible battle took place for a short while. The<br>mighty-armed Satyaki, having cut off my armour, became desirous of taking<br>me alive. He seized me while I lay down on the ground insensible. Then<br>within a short while that elephant-force was destroyed by Bhimasena with<br>his mace and Arjuna with his arrows. In consequence of those mighty<br>elephants, huge as hills, falling down on every side with crushed limbs,<br>the Pandava warriors found their way almost entirely blocked up. Then the<br>mighty Bhimasena, O monarch, dragging away those huge elephants, made a<br>way for the Pandavas to come out. Meanwhile, Ashvatthama and Kripa and<br>Kritavarma of the Satwata race, not seeing that chastiser of foes,<br>Duryodhana, amid the car-division, sought for thy royal son, Abandoning<br>the prince of the Pancalas, they proceeded to the spot where Subala's son<br>was anxious to have a sight of the king during that terrible carnage.'"
