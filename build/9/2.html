                            Vaishampayana said, "After the ladies had been dismissed, Dhritarashtra,<br>the son of Ambika, plunged into grief greater than that which had<br>afflicted him before, began, O monarch, to indulge in lamentations,<br>exhaling breaths that resembled smoke, and repeatedly waving his arms,<br>and reflecting a little, O monarch, he said these words.<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Alas, O Suta, the intelligence is fraught with<br>great grief that I hear from thee, that the Pandavas are all safe and<br>have suffered no loss in battle. Without doubt, my hard heart is made of<br>the essence of thunder, since it breaketh not upon hearing of the fall of<br>my sons. Thinking of their ages, O Sanjaya, and of their sports in<br>childhood, and learning today that all of them have perished, my heart<br>seems to break into pieces. Although in consequence of my blindness I<br>never saw their forms, still I cherished a great love for them in<br>consequence of the affection one feels for his children. Hearing that<br>they had passed out of childhood and entered the period of youth and then<br>of early manhood, I became exceedingly glad, O sinless one. Hearing today<br>that have been slain and divested of prosperity and energy, I fail to<br>obtain peace of mind, being overwhelmed with grief on account of the<br>distress that has overtaken them. Come, come, O king of kings<br>(Duryodhana) to me that am without a protector now! Deprived of thee, O<br>mighty-armed one, what will be my plight? Why, O sire, abandoning all the<br>assembled kings dost thou lie on the bare ground, deprived of life, like<br>an ordinary and wretched king? Having been, O monarch, the refuge of<br>kinsmen and friends, where dost thou go now, O hero, abandoning me that<br>am blind and old? Where now, O king, is that compassion of thine, that<br>love, and that respectfulness? Invincible as thou wert in battle, how,<br>alas, hast thou been slain by the Parthas? Who will now, after I will<br>have waked from sleep at the proper hour, repeatedly address me in such<br>endearing and respectful words as, "O father, O father," "O great king,"<br>"O Lord of the world" and affectionately clasping my neck with moistened<br>eyes, will seek my orders, saying, "Command me, O thou of Kuru's race."<br>Address me, O son, in that sweet language once more. O dear child, I<br>heard even these words from thy lips, "This wide earth is as much ours as<br>it is of Pritha's son. Bhagadatta and Kripa and Shalya and the two<br>princes of Avanti and Jayadratha and Bhurishrava and Sala and Somadatta<br>and Bahlika and Ashvatthama and the chief of the Bhojas and the mighty<br>prince of Magadha and Vrihadvala and the ruler of the Kasi and Shakuni<br>the son of Subala and many thousands of Mlecchas and Sakas and Yavanas,<br>and Sudakshina the ruler of the Kambojas and the king of the Trigartas<br>and the grandsire Bhishma and Bharadwaja's son and Gotama's son (Kripa)<br>and Srutayush and Ayutayush and Satayush of great energy, and Jalasandha<br>and Rishyasringa's son and the Rakshasa Alayudha, and the mighty-armed<br>Alambusa and the great car-warrior Subala&#8212;these and numerous other<br>kings, O best of monarchs, have taken up arms for my sake, prepared to<br>cast away their very lives in great battle, stationed on the field amidst<br>these, and surrounded by my brothers, I will fight against all the<br>Parthas and the Pancalas and the Cedis, O tiger among kings, and the sons<br>of Draupadi and Satyaki and Kunti-Bhoja and the rakshasa Ghatotkaca. Even<br>one amongst these, O king, excited with rage, is able to resist in battle<br>the Pandavas rushing towards him. What need I say then of all these<br>heroes, every one of whom has wrong to avenge on the Pandavas, when<br>united together? All these, O monarch, will fight with the followers of<br>the Pandavas and will slay them in battle. Karna alone, with myself, will<br>slay the Pandavas. All the heroic kings will then live under my sway. He,<br>who is their leader, the mighty Vasudeva, will not, he has told me, put<br>on mail for them, O king." Even in this way, O Suta, did Duryodhana often<br>use to speak to me. Hearing what he said, I believed that the Pandavas<br>would be slain in battle. When, however, my sons stationed in the midst<br>of those heroes and exerting themselves vigorously in battle have all<br>been slain, what can it be but destiny? When that lord of the world, the<br>valiant Bhishma, having encountered Shikhandi, met with his death like a<br>lion meeting with his at the hands of a jackal, what can it be but<br>destiny? When the Brahmana Drona, that master of all weapons offensive<br>and defensive, has been slain by the Pandavas in battle, what can it be<br>but destiny? When Bhurishrava has been slain in battle, as also Somadatta<br>and king Bahlika, what can it be but destiny? When Bhagadatta, skilled in<br>fight from the backs of elephants, has been slain, and when Jayadratha<br>hath been slain, what can it be but destiny? When Sudakshina has been<br>slain, and Jalasandha of Puru's race, as also Srutayush, and Ayutayush,<br>what can it be but destiny? When the mighty Pandya, that foremost of all<br>wielders of weapons, has been slain in battle by the Pandavas, what can<br>it be but destiny? When Vrihadvala has been slain and the mighty king of<br>the Magadhas, and the valiant Ugrayudha, that type of all bowmen; when<br>the two princes of Avanti (Vinda and Anuvinda) have been slain, and the<br>ruler also of the Trigartas, as also numerous Samsaptakas, what can it be<br>but destiny? When king Alambusa, and the Rakshasas Alayudha, and<br>Rishyasringa's son, have been slain, what can it be but destiny? When the<br>Narayanas have been slain, as also the Gopalas, those troops that were<br>invincible in battle, and many thousands of Mlecchas, what can it be but<br>destiny? When Shakuni, the son of Subala, and the mighty Uluka, called<br>the gamester's son, that hero at the head of his forces, have been slain,<br>what can it be but destiny? When innumerable high-souled heroes,<br>accomplished in all kinds of weapons offensive and defensive and endued<br>with prowess equal to that of Shakra himself, have been slain, O Suta,<br>when Kshatriyas hailing from diverse realms, O Sanjaya, have all been<br>slain in battle, what can it be but destiny? Endued with great might, my<br>sons and grandsons have been slain, as also my friends and brethren, what<br>can it be but destiny? Without doubt, man takes his birth, subject to<br>destiny. That man who is possessed of good fortune meets with good. I am<br>bereft of good fortune, and, therefore, am deprived of my children, O<br>Sanjaya. Old as I am, how shall I now submit to the sway of enemies? I do<br>not think anything other than exile into the woods to be good for me, O<br>lord. Deprived of relatives and kinsmen as I am, I will go into the<br>woods. Nothing other than an exile into the woods can be better for me<br>who am fallen into this plight and who am shorn of my wings, O Sanjaya.<br>When Duryodhana had been slain, when Shalya has been slain, when<br>Duhshasana and Vivingsati and the mighty Vikarna have been slain, how<br>shall I be able to bear the roars of that Bhimasena who hath alone slain<br>a hundred sons of mine in battle? He will frequently speak of the<br>slaughter of Duryodhana in my hearing. Burning with grief and sorrow, I<br>shall not be able to bear his cruel words.'"<br><br>Vaishampayana continued, "Even thus that king, burning with grief and<br>deprived of relatives and kinsmen, repeatedly swooned, overwhelmed with<br>sorrow on account of the death of his sons. Having wept for a long while,<br>Dhritarashtra, the son of Ambika, breathed heavy and hot sighs at the<br>thought of his defeat. Overwhelmed with sorrow, and burning with grief,<br>that bull of Bharata's race once more enquired of his charioteer Sanjaya,<br>the son of Gavalgana, the details of what had happened.<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'After Bhishma and Drona had been slain, and the<br>Suta's son also overthrown, whom did my warriors make their<br>generalissimo? The Pandavas are slaying without any delay everyone whom<br>my warriors are making their generalissimo in battle. Bhishma was slain<br>at the van of battle by the diadem-decked Arjuna in the very sight of all<br>of you. Even thus was Drona slain in the sight of all of you. Even thus<br>was the Suta's son, that valiant Karna, slain by Arjuna in the sight of<br>all the kings. Long before, the high-souled Vidura had told me that<br>through the fault of Duryodhana the population of the Earth would be<br>exterminated. There are some fools that do not see things even though<br>they cast their eyes on them. Those words of Vidura have been even so<br>unto my foolish self. What Vidura of righteous soul, conversant with<br>attributes of everything, then said, hath turned out exactly, for the<br>words he uttered were nothing but the truth. Afflicted by fate, I did not<br>then act according to those words. The fruits of that evil course have<br>now manifested themselves. Describe them to me, O son of Gavalgana, once<br>more! Who became the head of our army after Karna's fall? Who was that<br>car-warrior who proceeded against Arjuna and Vasudeva? Who were they that<br>protected the right wheel of the ruler of the Madras in battle? Who<br>protected the left wheel of that hero when he went to battle? Who also<br>guarded his rear? How, when all of you were together, could the mighty<br>king of the Madras, as also my son, be slain, O Sanjaya, by the Pandavas?<br>Tell me the details of the great destruction of the Bharatas. Tell me how<br>my son Duryodhana fell in battle. Tell me how all the Pancalas with their<br>followers, and Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi and the five sons of<br>Draupadi, fell. Tell me how the (five) Pandavas and the two Satwatas<br>(Krishna and Satyaki), and Kripa and Kritavarma and Drona's son, have<br>escaped with life. I desire to hear everything about the manner in which<br>the battle occurred and the kind of battle it was. Thou art skilled, O<br>Sanjaya, in narration. Tell me everything.'"
