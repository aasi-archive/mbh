                            Janamejaya said, "Thou hast described the merits of the Sarasvati, O best<br>of Brahmanas! It behoveth thee, O regenerate one, to describe to me the<br>investiture of Kumara (by the gods). Great is the curiosity I feel. Tell<br>me everything, therefore, about the time when and the place where and the<br>manner in which the adorable and puissant lord Skanda was invested (with<br>the command of the celestial forces). Tell me also, O foremost of<br>speakers, who they were that invested him and who performed the actual<br>rites, and how the celestial generalissimo made a great carnage of the<br>Daityas!"<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "This curiosity that thou feelest is worthy of thy<br>birth in Kuru's race. The words that I shall speak, will, O Janamejaya,<br>be conducive to thy pleasure. I shall narrate to thee the story of the<br>investiture of Kumara and the prowess of that high-souled one, since, O<br>ruler of men thou wishest to hear it! In days of yore the vital seed of<br>Maheshvara coming out, fell into a blazing fire. The consumer of<br>everything, the adorable Agni, could not burn that indestructible seed.<br>On the other hand, the bearer of sacrificial libations, in consequence of<br>that seed, became possessed of great energy and splendour. He could not<br>bear within himself that, seed of mighty energy. At the command of<br>Brahman, the lord Agni, approaching (the river) Ganga, threw into her<br>that divine seed possessed of the effulgence of the Sun. Ganga also,<br>unable to hold it, cast it on the beautiful breast of Himavat that is<br>worshipped by the celestials. Thereupon Agni's son began to grow there,<br>overwhelming all the worlds by his energy. Meanwhile (the six) Krittikas<br>beheld that child of fiery splendour. Seeing that puissant lord, that<br>high-souled son of Agni, lying on a clump of heath, all the six<br>Krittikas, who were desirous of a son, cried aloud, saying, "This child<br>is mine, this child is mine!" Understanding the state of mind of those<br>six mothers, the adorable lord Skanda sucked the breasts of all having<br>assumed six mouths. Beholding that puissance of the child, the Krittikas,<br>those goddesses of beautiful forms, became filled with wonder. And since<br>the adorable child had been cast by the river Ganga upon the summit of<br>Himavat, that mountain looked beautiful, having, O delighter of the<br>Kurus, been transformed into gold! With that growing child the whole<br>Earth became beautiful, and it was for this reason that mountains (from<br>that time) came to be producers of gold. Possessed of great energy, the<br>child came to be called by the name of Kartikeya. At first he had been<br>called by the name of Gangeya. He became possessed of high ascetic<br>powers. Endued with self-restraint and asceticism and great energy, the<br>child grew up, O monarch, into a person of highly agreeable features like<br>Soma himself. Possessed of great beauty, the child lay on that excellent<br>and golden clump of heath, adored and praised by Gandharvas and ascetics.<br>Celestial girls, by thousands, conversant with celestial music and dance,<br>and of very beautiful features, praised him and danced before him. The<br>foremost of all rivers, Ganga, waited upon that god. The Earth also,<br>assuming great beauty, held the child (on her lap). The celestial priest<br>Brihaspati performed the usual rites after birth, in respect of that<br>child. The Vedas assuming a four-fold form, approached the child with<br>joined hands. The Science of arms, with its four divisions, and all the<br>weapons as also all kinds of arrows, came to him. One day, the child, of<br>great energy, saw that god of gods, the lord of Uma, seated with the<br>daughter of Himavat, amid a swarm of ghostly creatures. Those ghostly<br>creatures, of emaciated bodies, were of wonderful features. They were<br>ugly and of ugly features, and wore awkward ornaments and marks. Their<br>faces were like those of tigers and lions and bears and cats and makaras.<br>Others were of faces like those of scorpions; others of faces like those<br>of elephants and camels and owls. And some had faces like those of<br>vultures and jackals. And some there were that had faces like those of<br>cranes and pigeons and Kurus. And many amongst them had bodies like those<br>of dogs and porcupines and iguanas and goats and sheep and cows. And some<br>resembled mountains and some oceans, and some stood with uplifted discs<br>and maces for their weapons. And some looked like masses of antimony and<br>some like white mountains. The seven Matris also were present there, O<br>monarch, and the Sadhyas, the Viswedevas, the Maruts, the Vasus, the<br>Rudras, the Adityas, the Siddhas, the Danavas, the birds, the self-born<br>and adorable Brahman with his sons, and Vishnu, and Shakra, all went<br>thither for beholding that child of unfading glory. And many of the<br>foremost of celestials and Gandharvas, headed by Narada and many<br>celestial Rishis and Siddhas headed by Brihaspati, and the fathers of the<br>universe, those foremost ones, they that are regarded as gods of the<br>gods, and the Yamas and the Dharmas, all went there. Endued with great<br>strength, the child possessed of great ascetic power, proceeded to the<br>presence of that Lord of the gods, (Mahadeva), armed with trident and<br>Pinaka. Seeing the child coming, the thought entered the mind of Siva, as<br>it did that of Himavat's daughter and that of Ganga and of Agni, as to<br>whom amongst the four the child would first approach for honouring him or<br>her. Each of them thought, 'He will come to me!' Understanding that this<br>was the expectation cherished by each of those four, he had recourse to<br>his Yoga powers and assumed at the same time four different forms. Indeed<br>the adorable and puissant lord assumed those four forms in an instant.<br>The three forms that stood behind were Sakha and Visakha and Naigameya.<br>The adorable and puissant one, having divided his self into four forms,<br>(proceeded towards the four that sat expecting him). The form called<br>Skanda of wonderful appearance proceeded to the spot where Rudra was<br>sitting. Visakha went to the spot where the divine daughter of Himavat<br>was. The adorable Sakha, which is Kartikeya's Vayu form proceeded towards<br>Agni. Naigameya, that child of fiery splendour, proceeded to the presence<br>of Ganga. All those forms, of similar appearance, were endued with great<br>effulgence. The four forms proceeded calmly to the four gods and<br>goddesses (already mentioned). All this seemed exceedingly wonderful. The<br>gods, the Danavas, and the Rakshasas, made a loud noise at sight of that<br>exceedingly wonderful incident making the very hair to stand on end. Then<br>Rudra and the goddess Uma and Agni, and Ganga, all bowed unto the<br>Grandsire, that Lord of the Universe. Having duly bowed unto him, O bull<br>among kings, they said these words, O monarch, from desire of doing good<br>unto Kartikeya. 'It behoveth thee, O Lord of the gods, to grant to this<br>youth, for the sake of our happiness, some kind of sovereignty that may<br>be suitable to him and that he may desire. At this, the adorable<br>Grandsire of all the worlds, possessed of great intelligence, began to<br>think within his mind as to what he should bestow upon that youth. He had<br>formerly given away unto the formless ones (gods) all kinds of wealth<br>over which the high-souled celestials, the Gandharvas, the Rakshasas,<br>ghosts, Yakshas, birds, and snakes have dominion. Brahma, therefore,<br>regarded that youth to be fully entitled to that dominion (which had been<br>bestowed upon the gods). Having reflected for a moment, the Grandsire,<br>ever mindful of the welfare of the gods, bestowed upon him the status of<br>a generalissimo among all creatures, O Bharata! And the Grandsire further<br>ordered all those gods that were regarded as the chief of the celestials<br>and other formless beings to wait upon him. Then the gods headed by<br>Brahman, taking that youth with them, together came to Himavat. The spot<br>they selected was the bank of the sacred and divine Sarasvati, that<br>foremost of rivers, taking her rise from Himavat, that Sarasvati which,<br>at Samanta-panchaka, is celebrated over the three worlds. There, on the<br>sacred bank, possessing every merit, of the Sarasvati, the gods and the<br>Gandharvas took their seats with hearts well-pleased in consequence of<br>the gratification of all their desires."
