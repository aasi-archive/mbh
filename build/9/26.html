                            "Sanjaya said, 'After that elephant-division had been destroyed, O<br>Bharata, by the son of Pandu, and while thy army was being thus<br>slaughtered by Bhimasena in battle, beholding the latter, that chastiser<br>of foes, careering like the all-killing Destroyer himself in rage armed<br>with his club, the remnant of thy unslaughtered sons, those uterine<br>brothers, O king, united together at that time when he of Kuru's race,<br>thy son Duryodhana, could not be seen, and rushed against Bhimasena. They<br>were Durmarshana and Srutanta and Jaitra and Bhurivala and Ravi, and<br>Jayatsena and Sujata and that slayer of foes, Durvishaha, and he called<br>Durvimochana, and Dushpradharsha and the mighty-armed Srutarvan. All of<br>them were accomplished in battle. Those sons of thine, uniting together,<br>rushed against Bhimasena and shut him up on all sides. Then Bhima, O<br>monarch, once more mounting on his own car, began to shoot keen shafts at<br>the vital limbs of thy sons. Those sons of thine, covered with arrows by<br>Bhimasena in that dreadful battle, began to drag that warrior like men<br>dragging an elephant from off a cross-way. Excited with rage, Bhimasena,<br>quickly cutting off the head of Durmarshana with a razor-headed arrow,<br>felled it on the Earth. With another broad-headed arrow capable of<br>penetrating every armour, Bhima next slew that mighty car-warrior, thy<br>son Srutanta. Then with the greatest ease, piercing Jayatsena with a<br>cloth-yard shaft, that chastiser of foes, the son of Pandu, felled that<br>scion of Kuru's race from his car. The prince, O king, fell down and<br>immediately expired. At this, thy son Srutarvan, excited with rage,<br>pierced Bhima with a hundred straight arrows winged with vulturine<br>feathers. Then Bhima, inflamed with rage, pierced Jaitra and Ravi and<br>Bhurivala, those three, with three shafts resembling poison or fire.<br>Those mighty car-warriors, thus struck, fell down from their cars, like<br>Kinsukas variegated with flowers in the season of spring cut down (by the<br>axe-man). Then that scorcher of foes, with another broad-headed arrow of<br>great keenness, struck Durvimochana and despatched him to Yama's abode.<br>Thus struck, that foremost of carwarriors fell down on the ground from<br>his car, like a tree growing on the summit of a mountain when broken by<br>the wind. The son of Pandu next struck thy other two sons at the head of<br>their forces, Dushpradharsha and Sujata, each with a couple of arrows in<br>that battle. Those two foremost of car-warriors, pierced with those<br>shafts, fell down. Beholding next another son of thine, Durvishaha,<br>rushing at him, Bhima pierced him with a broad-headed arrow in that<br>battle. That prince fell down from his car in the very sight of all the<br>bowmen. Beholding so many of his brothers slain by the singlehanded Bhima<br>in that battle, Srutarvan, under the influence of rage, rushed at Bhima,<br>stretching his formidable bow decked with gold and shooting a large<br>number of arrows that resembled poison or fire in energy. Cutting off the<br>bow of Pandu's son in that dreadful battle, the Kuru prince pierced the<br>bowless Bhima with twenty arrows. Then Bhimasena, that mighty<br>car-warrior, taking up another bow, shrouded thy son with arrows and<br>addressing him, said, "Wait, Wait!' The battle that took place between<br>the two was beautiful and fierce, like that which had occurred in days of<br>yore between Vasava and the Asura Jambha, O lord! With the keen shafts,<br>resembling the fatal rods of Yama, sped by those two warriors, the Earth,<br>the sky, and all the points of the compass, became shrouded. Then<br>Srutarvan, filled with rage, took up his bow and struck Bhimasena in that<br>battle, O king, with many arrows on his arms and chest. Deeply pierced, O<br>monarch, by thy son armed with the bow, Bhima became exceedingly agitated<br>like the ocean at the full or the new moon. Filled with wrath, Bhima<br>then, O sire, despatched with his arrows the driver and the four steeds<br>of thy son to Yama's abode. Beholding him carless, Pandu's son of<br>immeasurable soul, displaying the lightness of his hands, covered him<br>with winged arrows. The carless Srutarvan then, O king, took up a sword<br>and shield. As the prince, however, careered with his sword and bright<br>shield decked with a hundred moons, the son of Pandu struck off his head<br>from his trunk with a razor-headed arrow and felled it on the Earth. The<br>trunk of that illustrious warrior, rendered headless by means of that<br>razor-headed arrow, fell down from his car, filling the Earth with a loud<br>noise. Upon the fall of that hero, thy troops, though terrified, rushed<br>in that battle against Bhimasena from desire of fighting with him. The<br>valiant Bhimasena, clad in mail, received those warriors rushing quickly<br>at him from among the unslain remnant of that ocean of troops.<br>Approaching him, those warriors encompassed that hero on all sides. Thus<br>surrounded by those warriors of thine, Bhima began to afflict them all<br>with keen shafts like him of a 1,000 eyes afflicting the Asuras. Having<br>destroyed five hundred great cars with their fences, he once more slew<br>seven hundred elephants in that battle. Slaying next 10,000 foot-soldiers<br>with his mighty shafts, as also 800 steeds, the son of Pandu looked<br>resplendent. Indeed, Bhimasena, the son of Kunti, having slain thy sons<br>in battle, regarded his object achieved, O lord, and the purpose of his<br>birth accomplished. Thy troops, at that time, O Bharata, ventured to even<br>gaze at that warrior who was battling in that fashion and slaying thy men<br>in that way. Routing all the Kurus and slaying those followers of theirs,<br>Bhima then slapped his armpits, terrifying the huge elephants with the<br>noise he produced. Then thy army, O monarch, which had lost a very large<br>number of men, and which then consisted of a very few soldiers, became<br>exceedingly cheerless, O king!'"
