                            Vaishampayana said, "Collecting all articles as laid down in the<br>scriptures for the ceremony of investiture, Brihaspati duly poured<br>libations on the blazing fire. Himavat gave a seat which was adorned with<br>many costly gems. Kartikeya was made to sit on that auspicious and best<br>of seats decked with excellent gems. The gods brought thither all kinds<br>of auspicious articles, with due rites and mantras, that were necessary<br>for a ceremony of the kind. The diverse gods&#8212;Indra and Vishnu, both of<br>great energy, and Surya and Candramas, and Dhatri, and Vidhatri, and<br>Vayu, and Agni, and Pushan, and Bhaga, and Aryaman, and Ansa, and<br>Vivaswat, and Rudra of great intelligence, and Mitra, and the (eleven)<br>Rudras, the (eight) Vasus, the (twelve) Adityas, the (twin) Ashvinis, the<br>Viswedevas, the Maruts, the Saddhyas, the Pitris, the Gandharvas, the<br>Apsaras, the Yakshas, the Rakshasas, the Pannagas, innumerable celestial<br>Rishis, the Vaikhanasas, the Valakhilyas, those others (among Rishis)<br>that subsist only on air and those that subsist on the rays of the Sun,<br>the descendants of Bhrigu and Angiras, many high-souled Yatis, all the<br>Vidyadharas, all those that were crowned with ascetic success, the<br>Grandsire, Pulastya, Pulaha of great ascetic merits, Angiras, Kasyapa,<br>Atri, Marichi, Bhrigu, Kratu, Hara, Prachetas, Manu, Daksha, the Seasons,<br>the Planets, and all the luminaries; O monarch, all the rivers in their<br>embodied forms, the eternal Vedas, the Seas, the diverse tirthas, the<br>Earth, the Sky, the Cardinal and Subsidiary points of the compass, and<br>all the Trees, O king, Aditi the mother of the gods, Hri, Sri, Swaha,<br>Sarasvati, Uma, Sachi, Sinivali, Anumati, Kuhu, the Day of the new moon,<br>the Day of the full Moon, the wives of the denizens of heaven, Himavat,<br>Vindhya, Meru of many summits, Airavat with all his followers, the<br>Divisions of time called Kala, Kashtha, Fortnight, the Seasons, Night,<br>and Day, O king, the prince of steeds, Ucchaisravas, Vasuki the king of<br>the Snakes, Aruna, Garuda, the Trees, the deciduous herbs, and the<br>adorable god Dharma&#8212;all came there together. And there came also Kala,<br>Yama, Mrityu, and the followers of Yama. From fear of swelling the list I<br>do not mention the diverse other gods that came there. All of them came<br>to that ceremony for investing Kartikeya with the status of<br>generalissimo. All the denizens of heaven, O king, brought there<br>everything necessary for the ceremony and every auspicious article.<br>Filled with joy, the denizens of heaven made that high-souled youth, that<br>terror of the Asuras, the generalissimo of the celestial forces, after<br>pouring upon his head the sacred and excellent water of the Sarasvati<br>from golden jars that contained other sacred articles needed for the<br>purpose. The Grandsire of the worlds, Brahman, and Kasyapa of great<br>energy, and the others (mentioned and) not mentioned, all poured water<br>upon Skanda even as, O monarch, the gods had poured water on the head of<br>Varuna, the lord of waters, for investing him with dominion. The lord<br>Brahman then, with a gratified heart, gave unto Skanda four companions,<br>possessed of great might, endued with speed like that of the wind,<br>crowned with ascetic success, and gifted with energy which they could<br>increase at will. They were named Nandisena and Lohitaksha and<br>Ghantakarna and Kumudamalin. The lord Sthanu, O monarch, gave unto Skanda<br>a companion possessed of great impetuosity, capable of producing a<br>hundred illusions, and endued with might and energy that he could enhance<br>at will. And he was the great destroyer of Asuras. In the great battle<br>between the gods and the Asuras, this companion that Sthanu gave, filled<br>with wrath, slew, with his hands alone, fourteen millions of Daityas of<br>fierce deeds. The gods then made over to Skanda the celestial host,<br>invincible, abounding with celestial troops, capable of destroying the<br>enemies of the gods, and of forms like that of Vishnu. The gods then,<br>with Vasava at their head, and the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, the<br>Rakshasas, the Munis, and the Pitris, all shouted, 'Victory (to Skanda)!'<br>Then Yama gave him two companions, both of whom resembled Death, Unmatha<br>and Pramatha, possessed of great energy and great splendour. Endued with<br>great prowess, Surya, with a gratified heart, gave unto Kartikeya two of<br>his followers named Subhraja and Bhaswara. Soma also gave him two<br>companions, Mani and Sumani, both of whom looked like summits of the<br>Kailasa mountain and always used white garlands and white unguents. Agni<br>gave unto him two heroic companions, grinders of hostile armies, who were<br>named Jwalajihbha and Jyoti. Ansa gave unto Skanda of great intelligence<br>five companions, Parigha, and Vata, and Bhima of terrible strength, and<br>Dahati and Dahana, both of whom were exceedingly fierce and possessed of<br>great energy. Vasava that slayer of hostile heroes, gave unto Agni's son<br>two companions, Utkrosa and Panchaka, who were armed respectively with<br>thunder-bolt and club. These had in battle slain innumerable enemies of<br>Shakra. The illustrious Vishnu gave unto Skanda three companions, Chakra<br>and Vikrama and Sankrama of great might. The Ashvinis, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, with gratified hearts, gave unto Skanda two companions<br>Vardhana and Nandana, who had mastered all the sciences. The illustrious<br>Dhatri gave unto that high-souled one five companions, Kunda, Kusuma,<br>Kumuda, Damvara and Adamvara. Tvashtri gave unto Skanda two companions<br>named Chakra and Anuchakra, both of whom were endued with great strength.<br>The lord Mitra gave unto the high-souled Kumara two illustrious<br>companions named Suvrata and Satyasandha, both of whom were endued with<br>great learning and ascetic merit, possessed of agreeable features,<br>capable of granting boons and celebrated over the three worlds. Vidhatri<br>gave unto Kartikeya two companions of great celebrity, the high-souled<br>Suprabha and Subhakarman. Pushan gave him, O Bharata, two companions,<br>Panitraka and Kalika, both endued with great powers of illusion. Vayu<br>gave him, O best of the Bharatas, two companions, Vala and Ativala,<br>endued with great might and very large mouths. Varuna, firmly adhering to<br>truth, gave him Ghasa and Atighasa of great might and possessed of mouths<br>like those of whales. Himavat gave unto Agni's son two companions, O<br>King, Suvarchas and Ativarchas. Meru, O Bharata, gave him two companions<br>named Kanchana and Meghamalin. Manu also gave unto Agni's son two others<br>endued with great strength and prowess, Sthira and Atisthira. Vindhya<br>gave unto Agni's son two companions named Uschrita and Agnisringa both of<br>whom fought with large stones. Ocean gave him two mighty companions named<br>Sangraha and Vigraha, both armed with maces. Parvati of beautiful<br>features gave unto Agni's son Unmada and Pushpadanta and Sankukarna.<br>Vasuki, the king of the snakes, O tiger among men, gave unto the son of<br>Agni two snakes named Jaya and Mahajaya. Similarly the Saddhyas, the<br>Rudras, the Vasus, the Pitris, the Seas, the Rivers, and the Mountains,<br>all endued with great might, gave commanders of forces, armed with lances<br>and battle-axes and decked with diverse kinds of ornaments. Listen now to<br>the names of those other combatants armed with diverse weapons and clad<br>in diverse kinds of robes and ornaments, that Skanda procured.

Besides these, many other<br>high-souled and mighty companions, devoted to ascetic austerities and<br>regardful of Brahmanas, were given unto him by the Grandsire. Some of<br>them were in youth; some were old and some, O Janamejaya, were very young<br>in years. Thousands upon thousands of such came to Kartikeya. They were<br>possessed of diverse kinds of faces. Listen to me, O Janamejaya, as I<br>describe them! Some had faces like those of tortoises, and some like<br>those of cocks. The faces of some were very long, O Bharata.

Battle was the one thing in which they<br>took great delight, and all of them were invincible by even the foremost<br>ones amongst the gods. Many amongst them were clad in diverse kinds of<br>celestial robes. All were fond of battle. Some were of dark complexion,<br>and the faces of some had no flesh on them.
