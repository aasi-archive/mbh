                            "Sanjaya said, 'Upon the fall of that great king and mighty car-warrior,<br>that invincible hero (Shalya) in battle, thy troops as also thy sons<br>almost all turned away from the fight. Indeed, upon the slaughter of that<br>hero by the illustrious Yudhishthira, thy troops were like ship-wrecked<br>merchants on the vast deep without a raft to cross it. After the fall of<br>the Madra king, O monarch, thy troops, struck with fear and mangled with<br>arrows, were like masterless men desirous of a protector or a herd of<br>deer afflicted by a lion. Like bulls deprived of their horns or elephants<br>whose tusks have been broken, thy troops, defeated by Ajatasatru, fled<br>away at midday. After the fall of Shalya, O king, none amongst thy troops<br>set his heart on either rallying the army or displaying his prowess. That<br>fear, O king, and that grief, which had been ours upon the fall of<br>Bhishma, of Drona, and of the Suta's son, O Bharata, now became ours once<br>more, O monarch. Despairing of success upon the fall of the mighty<br>car-warrior Shalya, the Kuru army, with its heroes slain and exceedingly<br>confused, began to be cut down with keen shafts. Upon the slaughter of<br>the Madra king, O monarch, thy warriors all fled away in fear. Some on<br>horse-back, some on elephants, some on cars, great car-warriors with<br>great speed, and foot-soldiers also fled away in fear. 2,000 elephants,<br>looking like hills, and accomplished in smiting fled away, after Shalya's<br>fall, urged on with hooks and toes. Indeed, O chief of the Bharatas, thy<br>soldiers fled on all sides. Afflicted with arrows, they were seen to run,<br>breathing hard. Beholding them defeated and broken and flying away in<br>dejection, the Pancalas and the Pandavas, inspired with desire of<br>victory, pursued then hotly. The whiz of arrows and other noises, the<br>loud leonine roars, and the blare of conchs of heroic warriors, became<br>tremendous. Beholding the Kaurava host agitated with fear and flying<br>away, the Pancalas and the Pandavas addressed one another, saying, "Today<br>king Yudhishthira, firm in truth, hath vanquished his enemies. Today<br>Duryodhana hath been divested of his splendour and kingly prosperity.<br>Today, hearing of his sons' death, let Dhritarashtra, that king of men,<br>stupefied and prostrate on the Earth, feel the most poignant anguish. Let<br>him know today that the son of Kunti is possessed of great might among<br>all bowmen. Today that sinful and wicked-hearted king will censure his<br>own self. Let him recollect today the time and beneficial words of<br>Vidura. Let him from this day wait upon the Parthas as their slave. Let<br>that king today experience the grief that had been felt by the sons of<br>Pandu. Let that king know today the greatness of Krishna. Let him hear<br>today the terrible twang of Arjuna's bow in battle, as also the strength<br>of all his weapons, and the might of his arms in fight. Today he will<br>know the awful might of the high-souled Bhima when Duryodhana will be<br>slain in battle even as the Asura Vali was slain by Indra. Save Bhima of<br>mighty strength, there is none else in this world that can achieve that<br>which was achieved by Bhima himself at the slaughter of Duhshasana.<br>Hearing of the slaughter of the ruler of the Madras who was incapable of<br>defeat by the very gods, that king will know the prowess of the eldest<br>son of Pandu. After the slaughter of the heroic son of Subala and all the<br>Gandharas he will know the strength, in battle, of the two sons of Madri<br>by Pandu. Why will not victory be theirs that have Dhananjaya for their<br>warrior, as also Satyaki, and Bhimasena, and Dhrishtadyumna the son of<br>Prishata, and the five sons of Draupadi, and the two sons of Madri, and<br>the mighty bowman Shikhandi, and king Yudhishthira? Why will not victory<br>be theirs that have for their protector Krishna, otherwise called<br>Janardana, that protector of the universe? Why will not victory be theirs<br>that have righteousness for their refuge? Who else than Yudhishthira the<br>son of Pritha, who hath Hrishikesa, the refuge of righteousness and fame,<br>for his protector, is competent to vanquish in battle Bhishma and Drona<br>and Karna and the ruler of the Madras and the other kings by hundreds and<br>thousands?" Saying these words and filled with joy, the Srinjayas pursued<br>thy troops in that battle who had been exceedingly mangled with shafts.<br>Then Dhananjaya of great valour proceeded against the car-division of the<br>foe. The two sons of Madri and the mighty carwarrior Satyaki proceeded<br>against Shakuni. Beholding them all flying with speed in fear of<br>Bhimasena, Duryodhana as if smiling the while, addressed his driver,<br>saying, "Partha, stationed there with his bow, is transgressing me. Take<br>my steeds to the rear of the whole army. Like the ocean that cannot<br>transgress its continents, Kunti's son Dhananjaya will never venture to<br>transgress me, if I take up my stand in the rear. Behold, O driver, this<br>vast host that is pursued by the Pandavas. Behold this cloud of dust that<br>has arisen on all sides in consequence of the motion of the troops. Hear<br>those diverse leonine roars that are so awful and loud! Therefore, O<br>driver, proceed slowly and take up thy position in the rear. If I stay in<br>battle and fight the Pandavas, my army, O driver, will rally and come<br>back with vigour to battle." Hearing these words of thy son that were<br>just those of a hero and man of honour, the driver slowly urged those<br>steeds in trappings of gold. 21,000 foot-soldiers, deprived of elephants<br>and steeds and car-warriors, and who were ready to lay down their lives,<br>still stood for battle. Born in diverse countries and hailing from<br>diverse towns, those warriors maintained their ground, desirous of<br>winning great fame. The clash of those rushing warriors filled with joy<br>became loud and exceedingly terrible. Then Bhimasena, O king, and<br>Dhrishtadyumna the son of Prishata resisted them with four kinds of<br>forces. Other foot-soldiers proceeded against Bhima, uttering loud shouts<br>and slapping their armpits, all actuated by the desire of going to<br>heaven. Those Dhartarashtra combatants, filled with rage and invincible<br>in battle, having approached Bhimasena, uttered furious shouts. They then<br>spoke not to one another. Encompassing Bhima in that battle, they began<br>to strike him from all sides. Surrounded by that large body of warriors<br>on foot and struck by them in that battle, Bhima did not stir from where<br>he stood fixed like Mainaka mountain. His assailants, meanwhile, filled<br>with rage, O monarch, endeavoured to afflict that mighty car-warrior of<br>the Pandavas and checked other combatants (that tried to rescue him).<br>Encountered by those warriors, Bhima became filled with fury. Quickly<br>alighting from his car, he proceeded on foot against them. Taking up his<br>massive mace adorned with gold, he began to slay thy troops like the<br>Destroyer himself armed with his club. The mighty Bhima, with his mace,<br>crushed those 21,000 foot-soldiers who were without cars and steeds and<br>elephants. Having slain that strong division, Bhima, of prowess incapable<br>of being baffled, showed himself with Dhrishtadyumna in his front. The<br>Dhartarashtra foot-soldiers, thus slain, lay down on the ground, bathed<br>in blood, like Karnikaras with their flowery burthens laid low by a<br>tempest. Adorned with garlands made of diverse kinds of flowers, and<br>decked with diverse kinds of earrings, those combatants of diverse races,<br>who had hailed from diverse realms, lay down on the field, deprived of<br>life. Covered with banners and standards, that large host of<br>foot-soldiers, thus cut down, looked fierce and terrible and awful as<br>they lay down on the field. The mighty car-warriors, with their<br>followers, that fought under Yudhishthira's lead, all pursued thy<br>illustrious son Duryodhana. Those great bowmen, beholding thy troops turn<br>away from the battle, proceeded against Duryodhana, but they could not<br>transgress him even as the ocean cannot transgress its continents. The<br>prowess that we then beheld of thy son was exceedingly wonderful, since<br>all the Parthas, united together, could not transgress his single self.<br>Then Duryodhana, addressing his own army which had not fled far but<br>which, mangled with arrows, had set its heart on flight, said these<br>words, "I do not see the spot on plain or mountain, whither, if ye fly,<br>the Pandavas will not pursue and slay ye! What is the use then of flight?<br>The army of the Pandavas hath been reduced in numbers. The two Krishnas<br>are exceedingly mangled. If all of us make a stand, victory will be<br>certainly ours! If you fly away, losing all order, the sinful Pandavas,<br>pursuing you will slay you all! If, on the other hand, we make a stand,<br>good will result to us! Listen, all you Kshatriyas that are assailed<br>here! When the Destroyer always slays heroes and cowards, what man is<br>there so stupid that, calling himself a Kshatriya, will not fight? Good<br>will result to us if we stay in the front of the angry Bhimasena! Death<br>in battle, while struggling according to Kshatriya practices, is fraught<br>with happiness! Winning victory, one obtains happiness here. If slain,<br>one obtains great fruits in the other world! You Kauravas, there is no<br>better path to heaven than that offered by battle! Slain in battle, you<br>may, without delay, obtain all those regions of blessedness." Hearing<br>these words of his, and applauding them highly, the (Kuru) kings once<br>more rushed against the Pandavas for battling with them. Seeing them<br>advancing with speed, the Parthas, arrayed in order of battle, skilled in<br>smiting, excited with rage, and inspired with desire of victory, rushed<br>against them. The valiant Dhananjaya, stretching his bow Gandiva<br>celebrated over the three worlds, proceeded on his car against the foe.<br>The two sons of Madri, and Satyaki, rushed against Shakuni, and the other<br>(Pandava) heroes, smiling, rushed impetuously against thy forces.'"
