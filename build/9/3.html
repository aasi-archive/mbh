                            "Sanjaya said, 'Hear, O king, with attention, how that great carnage of<br>the Kurus and the Pandavas occurred when they encountered each other.<br>After the Suta's son had been slain by the illustrious son of Pandu, and<br>after thy troops had been repeatedly rallied and had repeatedly fled<br>away, and after a terrible carnage had taken place, O foremost of men, of<br>human beings in battle subsequent to Karna's death, Partha began to utter<br>leonine roars. At that time a great fear entered the hearts of thy sons.<br>Indeed, after Karna's death, there was no warrior in thy army who could<br>set his heart upon rallying the troops or displaying his prowess. They<br>then looked like ship-wrecked merchants on the fathomless ocean without a<br>raft to save themselves. When their protector was slain by the<br>diadem-decked Arjuna, they were like persons on the wide sea desirous of<br>reaching some shore of safety. Indeed, O king, after the slaughter of the<br>Suta's son, thy troops, struck with panic and mangled with arrows, were<br>like unprotected men desirous of a protector or like a herd of deer<br>afflicted by a lion. Vanquished by Savyasaci, they retired in the evening<br>like bulls with broken horns or snakes shorn of their fangs. Their<br>foremost of heroes slain, themselves thrown into confusion and mangled<br>with keen arrows, thy sons, O king, upon the slaughter of the Suta's son,<br>fled away in fear. Deprived of weapons and coats of mail, all of them<br>lost their senses and knew not in which direction to fly. Casting their<br>eyes on all sides in fear, many of them began to slaughter one another.<br>Many fell down or became pale, thinking, "It is me whom Vibhatsu is<br>pursuing!" "It is me whom Vrikodara is pursuing!" Some riding on fleet<br>steeds, some on fleet cars, and some on fleet elephants, many great<br>car-warriors fled away from fear, abandoning the foot-soldiers. Cars were<br>broken by elephants, horsemen were crushed by great car-warriors, and<br>bands of foot-soldiers were smashed and slain by bodies of horses as<br>these fled away from the field. After the fall of the Suta's son, thy<br>troops became like stragglers from a caravan in a forest abounding with<br>robbers and beasts of prey. Some elephants whose riders had been slain,<br>and others whose trunks had been cut off, afflicted with fear, beheld the<br>whole world to be full of Partha. Beholding his troops flying away<br>afflicted with the fear of Bhimasena Duryodhana then, with cries of "Oh!"<br>and "Alas!" addressed his driver, saying, "If I take up my post at the<br>rear of the army, armed with my bow, Partha then will never be able to<br>transgress me. Urge the steeds, therefore, with speed. When I will put<br>forth my valour in battle, Dhananjaya the son of Kunti will not venture<br>to transgress me like the ocean never venturing to transgress its<br>continents. Today, slaying Arjuna with Govinda, and the proud Vrikodara,<br>and the rest of my foes, I will free myself from the debt I owe to<br>Karna." Hearing these words of the Kuru king, so becoming a hero and an<br>honourable man, his driver slowly urged those steeds adorned with<br>trappings of gold. At that time many brave warriors deprived of elephants<br>and steeds and cars, and 25,000 foot-soldiers, O sire, proceeded slowly<br>(for battle). Then Bhimasena, filled with wrath, and Dhrishtadyumna the<br>son of Prishata, encompassing those troops with the assistance of four<br>kinds of forces, destroyed them with shafts. All of them fought<br>vigorously with Bhima and Prishata's son. Many amongst them challenged<br>the two Pandava heroes, mentioning their names. Surrounded by them in<br>battle, Bhima became enraged with them. Quickly descending from his car,<br>he began to fight, armed with his mace. Relying on the might of his own<br>arms, Vrikodara the son of Kunti, who was on his car, observant of the<br>rules of fair fight, did not fight with those foes who were on the<br>ground. Armed then with that heavy mace of his that was made entirely of<br>iron and adorned with gold and equipped with a sling, and that resembled<br>the Destroyer himself as he becomes at the end of Yuga, Bhima slew them<br>all like Yama slaughtering creatures with his club. Those foot-soldiers,<br>excited with great rage, having lost their friends and kinsmen, were<br>prepared to throw away their lives, and rushed in that battle towards<br>Bhima like insects towards a blazing fire. Indeed, those warriors, filled<br>with rage and invincible in battle, approaching Bhimasena, suddenly<br>perished like living creatures at the glance of the Destroyer. Armed with<br>sword and mace, Bhima careered like a hawk and slaughtered those 25,000<br>warriors of thine. Having slain that brave division, the mighty Bhima, of<br>prowess incapable of being baffled, once more stood, with Dhrishtadyumna<br>before him. Meanwhile, Dhananjaya of great energy proceeded towards the<br>car-division (of the Kurus). The twin sons of Madri and the mighty<br>car-warrior Satyaki, all endued with great strength, cheerfully rushed<br>against Shakuni with great speed from desire of slaying him. Having slain<br>with keen shafts the numerous cavalry of Shakuni, those Pandava heroes<br>quickly rushed against Shakuni himself, whereupon a fierce battle was<br>fought there. Then Dhananjaya, O king, penetrated into the midst of the<br>car-division of the Kauravas, stretching his bow Gandiva celebrated over<br>the three worlds. Beholding that car having white steeds yoked unto it<br>and owning Krishna for its driver coming towards them, with Arjuna as the<br>warrior on it, thy troops fled away in fear. Deprived of cars and steeds<br>and pierced with shafts from every side, 25,000 foot-soldiers proceeded<br>towards Partha and surrounded him. Then that mighty car-warrior amongst<br>the Pancalas (Dhrishtadyumna) with Bhimasena at his head, speedily slew<br>that brave division and stood triumphant. The son of the Pancala king,<br>the celebrated Dhrishtadyumna, was a mighty bowman possessed of great<br>beauty and a crusher of large bands of foes. At sight of Dhrishtadyumna<br>unto whose car were yoked steeds white as pigeons and whose standard was<br>made of a lofty Kovidara, the troops fled away in fear. The celebrated<br>sons of Madri, with Satyaki among them, engaged in the pursuit of the<br>Gandhara king who was quick in the use of weapons, speedily appeared to<br>our view. Chekitana and the (five) sons of Draupadi, O sire, having slain<br>a large number of thy troops, blew their conchs. Beholding all the troops<br>flying away with their faces from the field, those (Pandava) heroes<br>pursued and smote them like bulls pursuing vanquished bulls. Then the<br>mighty Savyasaci, the son of Pandu, beholding a remnant of thy army still<br>keeping their ground, became filled with rage, O king. Suddenly, O<br>monarch, he shrouded that remnant of thy forces with arrows. The dust,<br>however, that was then raised enveloped the scene, in consequence of<br>which we could not see anything. Darkness also spread over the scene, and<br>the field of battle was covered with arrows. Thy troops, O monarch, then<br>fled away in fear on all sides. When his army was thus broken, the Kuru<br>king, O monarch, rushed against both friends and foes. Then Duryodhana<br>challenged all the Pandavas to battle, O chief of Bharata's race, like<br>the Asura Vali in days of yore challenging all the celestials. The<br>Pandavas then, uniting together and filled with rage, upbraiding him<br>repeatedly and shooting diverse weapons, rushed against the roaring<br>Duryodhana. The latter, however, fearlessly smote his foes with shafts.<br>The prowess that we then saw of thy son was exceedingly wonderful, since<br>all the Pandavas together were unable to transgress him. At this time<br>Duryodhana beheld, staying at a little distance from him, his troops,<br>exceedingly mangled with shafts, and prepared to fly away. Rallying them<br>then, O monarch, thy son, resolved on battle and desirous of gladdening<br>them, addressed those warriors, saying, "I do not see that spot on plain<br>or mountain whither, if you fly, the Pandavas will not slay you. What is<br>the use then in flight? The Pandava army hath now been reduced to a small<br>remnant. The two Krishnas have been exceedingly mangled. If all of us<br>make a stand here, we are certain to have victory. If, however, you fly<br>away, breaking your array, the Pandavas, pursuing your sinful selves,<br>will slay all of you. Death in battle, therefore, is for our good. Death<br>in the field of battle while engaged in fight according to Kshatriya<br>practices is pleasant. Such death produces no kind of grief. By<br>encountering such a death, a person enjoys eternal happiness in the other<br>world. Let all the Kshatriyas assembled here listen to me. It were better<br>that they should even submit to the power of the angry Bhimasena than<br>that they should abandon the duties practised by them from the days of<br>their ancestors. There is no act more sinful for a Kshatriya than flight<br>from battle. You Kauravas, there is not a better path to heaven than the<br>duty of battle. The warrior acquires in a day regions of bliss (in the<br>other world) that take many long years for others to acquire." Fulfilling<br>those words of the king, the great Kshatriya car-warriors once more<br>rushed against the Pandavas, unable to endure their defeat and firmly<br>resolved to put forth their prowess. Then commenced a battle once more,<br>that was exceedingly fierce, between thy troops and the enemy, and that<br>resembled the one between the gods and the Asuras. Thy son Duryodhana<br>then, O monarch, with all his troops, rushed against the Pandavas headed<br>by Yudhishthira.'"
