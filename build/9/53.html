                            "The Rishis said, 'O Rama, this Samantapanchaka is said to be the eternal<br>northern altar of Brahman, the Lord of all creatures. There the denizens<br>of heaven, those givers of great boons, performed in days of yore a great<br>sacrifice. That foremost of royal sages, the high-souled Kuru, of great<br>intelligence and immeasurable energy, had cultivated this field for many<br>years. Hence it came to be Kurukshetra (the field of Kuru)!'<br><br>"Rama said, 'For what reason did the high-souled Kuru cultivate this<br>field? I desire to have this narrated by you, ye Rishis possessed of<br>wealth of penances!'<br><br>"The Rishis said, 'In days of yore, O Rama, Kuru was engaged in<br>perseveringly tilling the soil of this field. Shakra, coming down from<br>heaven, asked him the reason, saying, "Why O king, art thou employed (in<br>this task) with such perseverance? What is thy purpose, O royal sage, for<br>the accomplishment of which thou art tilling the soil?" Kuru thereupon<br>replied, saying, "O thou of a hundred sacrifices, they that will die upon<br>this plain shall proceed to regions of blessedness after being cleansed<br>of their sins!" The lord Shakra, ridiculing this, went back to heaven.<br>The royal sage Kuru, however, without being at all depressed, continued<br>to till the soil. Shakra repeatedly came to him and repeatedly receiving<br>the same reply went away ridiculing him. Kuru, however, did not, on that<br>account, feel depressed. Seeing the king till the soil with unflagging<br>perseverance. Shakra summoned the celestials and informed them of the<br>monarch's occupation. Hearing Indra's words, the celestials said unto<br>their chief of a 1,000 eyes, "Stop the royal sage, O Shakra by granting<br>him a boon, if thou canst! If men, by only dying there were to come to<br>heaven, without having performed sacrifices to us, our very existence<br>will be endangered!" Thus exhorted, Shakra then came back to that royal<br>sage and said, "Do not toil any more! Act according to my words! Those<br>men that will die here, having abstained from food with all their senses<br>awake, and those that will perish here in battle, shall, O king, come to<br>heaven! They, O thou of great soul, shall enjoy the blessings of heaven,<br>O monarch!" Thus addressed, king Kuru answered Shakra, saying, "So be<br>it!" Taking Kuru's leave, the slayer of Vala, Shakra, then, with a joyful<br>heart, quickly went back to heaven. Even thus, O foremost one of Yadu's<br>race, that royal sage had, in days of yore, tilled this plain and Shakra<br>had promised great merit unto those that would cast off their bodies<br>here. Indeed, it was sanctioned by all the foremost ones, headed by<br>Brahman, among the gods, and by the sacred Rishis, that on earth there<br>should be no more sacred spot than this! Those men that perform austere<br>penances here would all after casting off their bodies go to Brahman's<br>abode. Those meritorious men, again, that would give away their wealth<br>here would soon have their wealth doubled. They, again, that will, in<br>expectation of good, reside constantly here, will never have to visit the<br>region of Yama. Those kings that will perform great sacrifices here will<br>reside as long in heaven as Earth herself will last. The chief of the<br>celestials, Shakra, himself composed a verse here and sang it. Listen to<br>it, O Baladeva! "The very dust of Kurukshetra, borne away by the wind,<br>shall cleanse persons of wicked acts and bear them to heaven!" The<br>foremost ones amongst the gods, as also those amongst the Brahmanas, and<br>many foremost ones among the kings of the Earth such as Nriga and others,<br>having performed costly sacrifices here, after abandoning their bodies,<br>proceeded to heaven. The space between the Tarantuka and the Arantuka and<br>the lakes of Rama and Shamachakra, is known as Kurukshetra.<br>Samantapanchaka is called the northern (sacrificial) altar of Brahman,<br>the Lord of all creatures. Auspicious and highly sacred and much regarded<br>by the denizens of heaven is this spot that possesses all attributes. It<br>is for this that Kshatriyas slain in battle here obtain sacred regions of<br>eternal blessedness. Even this was said by Shakra himself about the high<br>blessedness of Kurukshetra. All that Shakra said was again approved and<br>sanctioned by Brahman, by Vishnu, and by Maheshvara.'"
