                            (Hrada-pravesa Parva)<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'After this, the followers of Subala's son, O monarch,<br>became filled with rage. Prepared to lay down their lives in that<br>dreadful battle, they began to resist the Pandavas. Resolved to aid<br>Sahadeva in his victory, Arjuna, as also Bhimasena possessed of great<br>energy and resembling an angry snake of virulent poison in aspect,<br>received those warriors. With his Gandiva, Dhananjaya baffled the purpose<br>of those warriors, who, armed with darts and swords and lances, desired<br>to slay Sahadeva. Vibhatsu, with his broad-headed arrows, cut off the<br>steeds, the heads, and the arms, with weapons in grasp of those rushing<br>combatants. The steeds of those foremost of heroes endued with activity,<br>struck by Savyasaci, fell down on the earth, deprived of their lives.<br>King Duryodhana, beholding that carnage of his own troops, O lord, became<br>filled with rage. Assembling together the remnant of his cars which still<br>numbered many hundreds, as also his elephants and horse and foot, O<br>scorcher of foes, thy son said these words unto those warriors,<br>"Encountering all the Pandavas with their friends and allies, in this<br>battle, and the prince of Pancala also with his own troops, and slaying<br>them quickly, turn back from the fight!" Respectfully accepting that<br>command of his, those warriors, difficult of defeat in battle, proceeded<br>once more against the Parthas in that battle, at the behest of thy son.<br>The Pandavas, however, covered with their arrows resembling snakes of<br>virulent poison, all those warriors, forming the remnant of the Kaurava<br>army, that thus rushed quickly against them in that dreadful battle. That<br>army, O chief of the Bharatas, as it came to battle, was in a moment<br>exterminated by those high-souled warriors, for it failed to obtain a<br>protector. In consequence of the (Kaurava) steeds running hither and<br>thither that were all covered with the dust raised by the army, the<br>cardinal and the subsidiary points of the compass could not be<br>distinguished. Many warriors, issuing out of the Pandava array, O<br>Bharata, slew thy troops in a moment in that battle. Eleven Akshauhinis,<br>O Bharata, of troops had been assembled for thy son! All those, O lord,<br>were slain by the Pandus and the Srinjayas! Amongst those thousands upon<br>thousands of high-souled kings on thy side, only Duryodhana now, O<br>monarch, exceedingly wounded, was seen to be alive, casting his eyes on<br>all sides, and seeing the earth empty, himself destitute of all his<br>troops while the Pandavas, filled with joy in that battle, were roaring<br>aloud in consequence of the accomplishment of all their objects.<br>Duryodhana, O monarch, unable to endure the whiz of the shafts shot by<br>those high-souled heroes, became stupefied! Destitute of troops and<br>animals, he set his heart on retreat from the field.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'When my troops were slain and our camp made<br>entirely empty, what was the strength, O Suta, of the troops that still<br>remained to the Pandavas? I desire to know this. Therefore, tell me, O<br>Sanjaya, for thou art skilled (in narration). Tell me also, O Sanjaya,<br>that which was done by my son, the wicked Duryodhana, that lord of the<br>earth, the sole survivor of so many men, when he saw his army<br>exterminated.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, '2,000 cars, 700 elephants, 5,000 horse, and 10,000<br>foot, this was the remnant, O monarch, of the mighty host of the<br>Pandavas. Taking care of this force, Dhrishtadyumna waited in that<br>battle. Meanwhile, O chief of the Bharatas, king Duryodhana, that<br>foremost of car-warriors, saw not in that battle a single warrior on his<br>side. Beholding his enemies roaring aloud and witnessing the<br>extermination of his own army, that lord of the earth, Duryodhana,<br>without a companion, abandoned his slain steed, and fled from the field<br>with face turned eastwards. That lord of eleven Akshauhinis, thy son<br>Duryodhana, of great energy, taking up his mace, fled on foot towards a<br>lake. Before he had proceeded far on foot, the king recalled the words of<br>the intelligent and virtuous Vidura. Without doubt, this had been<br>foreseen by Vidura of great wisdom, this great carnage of Kshatriyas and<br>of ourselves in battle. Reflecting on this, the king, with heart burning<br>in grief at having witnessed the extermination of his army, desired to<br>penetrate into the depths of that lake. The Pandavas, O monarch, with<br>Dhrishtadyumna at their head, filled with rage, rushed against (the small<br>remnant of) thy army. With his Gandiva, Dhananjaya baffled the purpose of<br>the (Kaurava) troops, who, armed with darts and swords and lances, were<br>uttering loud roars. Having with his sharp shafts slain those troops with<br>their allies and kinsmen, Arjuna, as he stood on his car having white<br>steeds yoked unto it, looked exceedingly beautiful. Upon the fall of<br>Subala's son along with horse, cars and elephants, thy army looked like a<br>large forest laid low (by the wind). In Duryodhana's army then, O<br>monarch, which had numbered many hundred thousands of warriors, not<br>another great car-warrior was seen to be alive, save the heroic son of<br>Drona, and Kritavarma, and Kripa the son of Gotama, O monarch, and that<br>lord of the earth, thy son! Dhrishtadyumna, seeing me, laughingly<br>addressed Satyaki, saying, 'What is the use of seizing this one? Nothing<br>will be gained by keeping him alive.' Hearing these words of<br>Dhrishtadyumna, the grandson of Sini, that great car-warrior, uplifting<br>his sharp sword, prepared to slay me. Just at that juncture, the<br>Island-born Krishna of great wisdom (Vyasa), coming there, said, "Let<br>Sanjaya be dismissed alive! By no means should he be slain!" Hearing<br>these words of the Island-born, the grandson of Sini, joined his hands,<br>and then, setting me free said unto me, "Peace to thee, O Sanjaya, thou<br>mayest go hence!" Permitted by him, I myself then, putting off my armour<br>and making over my weapons, set out on the evening on the road leading to<br>the city, my limbs bathed in blood. After I had come about two miles, O<br>monarch, I beheld Duryodhana, standing alone, mace in hand, and<br>exceedingly mangled. His eyes were full of tears and therefore he could<br>not see me. I stood cheerlessly before him. He looked accordingly at me<br>without recognising me. Beholding him standing alone on the field and<br>indulging in grief, I also, overwhelmed with sorrow, succeeded not for a<br>little while to speak a single word. Then I said unto him everything<br>about my own capture and my release through the grace of the Island-born.<br>Having reflected for a moment, and regained his senses, he enquired of me<br>about his brothers and his troops. I had seen everything with my eyes and<br>therefore told him everything, that his brothers had all been slain and<br>that all his troops had been exterminated. I told the king that we had at<br>that time only three car-warriors left alive, for the Island-born had<br>said so unto me when I set out (from the place where the Pandavas were).<br>Drawing deep breaths and looking repeatedly at me, thy son touched me<br>with his hand and said, "Except thee, O Sanjaya, there is none else that<br>liveth, amongst those engaged in this battle! I do not see another (on my<br>side), while the Pandavas have their allies living! Say, O Sanjaya, unto<br>that lord, the blind king Dhritarashtra, that his son Duryodhana hath<br>entered the depths of a lake! Destitute of friends such as those (I<br>lately had), deprived of sons and brothers, and seeing his kingdom taken<br>by the Pandavas, who is there like me that would desire to live? Say all<br>this unto the king and tell him further that I have escaped with life<br>from that dreadful battle, and that, alive, though exceedingly wounded, I<br>shall rest within the depths of this lake." Having said these words unto<br>me, O monarch, the king entered that lake. That ruler of men, by his<br>power of illusion, then charmed the waters of that lake, making a space<br>for him within them. After he had entered that lake, I myself, without<br>anybody on my side, saw those three car-warriors (of our army) coming<br>together to that spot with their tired animals. They were Kripa, the son<br>of Saradwat, and the heroic Ashvatthama, that foremost of car-warriors,<br>and Kritavarma of Bhoja's race. Mangled with shafts, all of them came<br>together to that spot. Beholding me, they all urged their steeds to<br>greater speed and coming up to me, said, "By good luck, O Sanjaya, thou<br>livest yet!" All of them then enquired after thy son, that ruler of men,<br>saying, 'Is our king Duryodhana still alive, O Sanjaya?' I then told them<br>that the king was well in body. I also told them everything that<br>Duryodhana had said unto me. I also pointed out to them the lake that the<br>king had entered. Then Ashvatthama, O king, having heard those words from<br>me, cast his eyes on that extensive lake and began to wail in grief,<br>saying, "Alas, alas, the king knows not that we are still alive! With him<br>amongst us, we are still quite able to fight with our foes!" Those mighty<br>car-warriors, having wept there for a long time, fled away at sight of<br>the sons of Pandu. Those three car-warriors that formed the remnant of<br>our army took me up on the well-adorned car of Kripa, and then proceeded<br>to the Kuru camp. The sun had set a little before. The troops forming the<br>outposts of the camp, learning that all thy sons had been slain, wept<br>aloud. Then, O monarch, the old men that had been appointed to look after<br>the ladies of the royal household proceeded towards the city, taking the<br>princesses after them. Loud were the wails uttered by those weeping<br>ladies when they heard of the destruction of the whole army. The women, O<br>king, crying ceaselessly, caused the earth to resound with their voices<br>like a flight of she-ospreys. They tore their bodies with nails and<br>struck their heads with their hands, and untied their braids, indulging<br>all the while in loud cries. Filling the air with sounds such as "Oh!"<br>and "Alas!" and beating their breasts, they cried aloud and wept and<br>uttered loud shrieks, O monarch! Then the friends of Duryodhana, deeply<br>afflicted and made voiceless by their tears, set out for the city, taking<br>the ladies of the royal household with them. The camp-guards quickly fled<br>towards the city, taking with them many white beds overlaid with costly<br>coverlets. Others, placing their wives on cars drawn by mules, proceeded<br>towards the city. Those ladies, O monarch, who, while in their houses<br>could not be seen by the very sun, were now, as they proceeded towards<br>the city, exposed to the gaze of the common people. Those women, O chief<br>of the Bharata's race, who were very delicate, now proceeded with speed<br>towards the city, having lost their near ones and kinsmen. The very<br>cow-herds and shepherds and common men, filled with panic and afflicted<br>with the fear of Bhimasena, fled towards the city. Even these were filled<br>with a great fear of the Parthas. Looking at one another, all of them<br>fled towards the city. During the progress of that general flight<br>attended with such circumstances of fear, Yuyutsu, deprived of his senses<br>by grief, thought upon what he should do in view of the emergency that<br>had come. "Duryodhana hath been vanquished in battle by the Pandavas of<br>terrible prowess! He had eleven Akshauhinis of troops under him! All his<br>brothers have been slain! All the Kauravas, headed by Bhishma and Drona,<br>have perished! Through the influence of Destiny, only I have been saved!<br>All those that were in the Kuru camp have fled! Alas, they are flying on<br>all sides, deprived of energy and destitute of protectors! Such a sight<br>had never been seen before! Afflicted with sorrow, with eyes anxious in<br>fear, they are flying away on all sides like a herd of deer, looking at<br>one another! Those amongst the counsellors of Duryodhana that are yet<br>alive have fled towards the city, taking with them the ladies of the<br>royal household! I think, O lord, that the time hath come when I also<br>should enter the city with them, after taking the permission of<br>Yudhishthira and Vasudeva!" For this purpose that mighty-armed prince<br>presented himself before both those heroes. King Yudhishthira, who is<br>always compassionate, became highly pleased with him. The mighty-armed<br>Pandava embraced that child of a Vaisya mother and dismissed him<br>affectionately. Riding upon his own car, he urged his steeds to great<br>speed. He then supervised the removal of the ladies of the royal<br>household to the city. The sun was setting. With those ladies, Yuyutsu<br>entered the city of Hastinapura, with tearful eyes and with voice choked<br>in grief. He then saw Vidura of great wisdom, sitting with tearful eyes.<br>He had come away from Dhritarashtra, his heart having been afflicted with<br>great sorrow. Bowing down unto Vidura, he stood before him. Devoted to<br>truth, Vidura addressed him, saying, "By good luck, O son, thou livest<br>amid this general destruction of the Kurus! Why, however, hast thou come<br>without king Duryodhana in thy company? Tell me in detail the cause of<br>this!" Yuyutsu then said, "After the fall of Shakuni, O sire, with all<br>his kinsmen and friends, king Duryodhana abandoning the steed he rode,<br>fled away, in fear towards the east. After the king had fled away, all<br>the people in the (Kaurava) encampment, agitated with fear, fled towards<br>the city. Then the protectors of the ladies, placing the wives of the<br>king, as also those of his brothers, on vehicles, fled away in fear.<br>Obtaining the permission of king Yudhishthira and Keshava, I set out for<br>Hastinapura, for protecting the people thus flying away!' Hearing these<br>words spoken by the son of Dhritarashtra's Vaisya wife, Vidura of<br>immeasurable soul, conversant with every usage and feeling that was<br>proper at that hour, applauded the eloquent Yuyutsu. And he said, 'Thou<br>hast acted properly, having regard for what has come, in view of this<br>destruction of all the Bharatas of which thou art speaking! Thou hast<br>also, from compassion, maintained the honour of thy race! By good luck,<br>we behold thee come back with life from this terrible battle that is so<br>destructive of heroes, like creatures beholding the sun possessed of<br>blazing glory! Thou, O son, are now in every way the sole staff of the<br>blind monarch, bereft of foresight, afflicted with calamity, struck by<br>Destiny, and who, though repeatedly dissuaded, could not abstain from<br>pursuing his evil policy. Take rest here for this day! Tomorrow thou<br>mayst return to Yudhishthira!" Having said these words, Vidura, with<br>tearful eyes, took leave of Yuyutsu and entered the abode of the king,<br>which resounded with cries of "Oh!" and "Alas!" uttered by citizens and<br>villagers afflicted with woe. The cheerless mansion seemed to have lost<br>all its beauty; comfort and happiness seemed to have deserted it. It was<br>all empty and pervaded by disorder. Already filled with sorrow, Vidura's<br>grief increased at that sight. Conversant with every duty, Vidura, with a<br>sorrowful heart, entered the palace, drawing deep breaths. As regards<br>Yuyutsu, he passed that night in his own abode. Afflicted with woe, he<br>failed to obtain any joy at the panegyrics with which he was greeted. He<br>passed the time, thinking of the terrible destruction of the Bharatas at<br>one another's hands.'"
