                            "Sanjaya said, 'During the progress of that battle which was so<br>destructive of men and steeds and elephants, Subala's son, Shakuni, O<br>king, rushed against Sahadeva. The valiant Sahadeva, as Shakuni rushed<br>quickly towards him, sped showers of swift arrows at that warrior as<br>numerous as a flight of insects. At that time, Uluka also encountered<br>Bhima and pierced him with ten arrows, Shakuni, meanwhile, O monarch,<br>having pierced Bhima with three arrows, covered Sahadeva with ninety.<br>Indeed, those heroes, O king, encountering one another in that battle,<br>pierced one another with many keen arrows equipped with Kanka and peacock<br>feathers, winged with gold, whetted on stone, and sped from bow-strings<br>drawn to their ears. Those showers of arrows sped from their bows and<br>arms, O monarch, shrouded all the points of the compass like a thick<br>shower of rain poured from the clouds. Then Bhima, filled with rage, and<br>Sahadeva of great valour, both endued with great might, careered in that<br>battle, making an immense carnage. That army, O Bharata, was covered with<br>hundreds of arrows by those two warriors. In consequence thereof, the<br>welkin on many parts of the field became shrouded with darkness. In<br>consequence, O monarch, of steeds, covered with arrows, dragging after<br>them, as they ran, a large number of slain combatants, the tracks on many<br>parts of the field became entirely blocked up. Covered with steeds slain<br>with their riders, with broken shields and lances, O monarch, and with<br>swords and darts and spears all around, the Earth looked variegated as if<br>strewn with flowers. The combatants, O king, encountering one another,<br>careered in battle, filled with wrath and taking one another's life. Soon<br>the field became strewn with heads, beautiful as the filaments of the<br>lotus, adorned with earrings and graced with faces set with eyes upturned<br>in wrath and lips bit in rage. Covered also, O monarch, with the severed<br>arms of warriors that resembled the trunks of huge elephants, that were<br>adorned with Angadas and cased in leathern fences, and that still held<br>swords and lances and battle-axes, and with headless bodies risen on<br>their feet and bleeding and dancing on the field, and swarming with<br>carnivorous creatures of diverse kinds, the Earth, O lord, presented a<br>frightful aspect! After the Bharata army had been reduced to a small<br>remnant, the Pandavas, filled with delight in that dreadful battle began<br>to despatch the Kauravas to Yama's abode. Meanwhile, the heroic and<br>valiant son of Subala's son very forcibly struck Sahadeva on the head<br>with a lance. Exceedingly agitated, O monarch, in consequence of the<br>blow, Sahadeva sat down on the terrace of his car. Beholding Sahadeva in<br>that plight, the valiant Bhima, filled with rage, O Bharata, held the<br>whole Kuru army in check. With his cloth-yard shaft he pierced hundreds<br>and thousands of hostile warriors, and having pierced them so, that<br>chastier of foes uttered a leonine roar. Frightened at that roar, all the<br>followers of Shakuni, with their steeds and elephants, precipitately fled<br>away in fear. Beholding them broken, king Duryodhana said unto them,<br>"Stop, ye Kshatriyas, unacquainted with morality! Fight! What is the use<br>of flight? That hero, who, without showing his back casteth away his life<br>breath in battle, achieveth fame here and enjoyeth regions of bliss<br>hereafter!" Thus exhorted by the king, the followers of Subala's son once<br>more advanced against the Pandavas, making death their goal. Awful, O<br>monarch, was the noise made by those rushing warriors, resembling that of<br>the agitated ocean. At this, the field of battle became agitated all<br>around. Beholding those followers of Subala's son thus advancing in<br>battle, the victorious Pandavas, O monarch, proceeded against them.<br>Comforted a little, the invincible Sahadeva, O monarch, pierced Shakuni<br>with ten arrows and his steeds with three. With the greatest ease he then<br>cut off the bow of Subala's son with a number of other arrows. Invincible<br>in battle, Shakuni, however, took up another bow and pierced Nakula with<br>sixty arrows and then Bhimasena with seven. Uluka also, O king, desirous<br>of rescuing his sire in that engagement, pierced Bhima with seven arrows<br>and Sahadeva with seventy. Bhimasena in that encounter pierced Uluka with<br>many keen arrows and Shakuni with four and sixty, and each of the other<br>warriors who fought around them, with three arrows. Struck by Bhimasena<br>with shafts steeped in oil, the Kauravas, filled with rage in that<br>battle, covered Sahadeva with showers of arrows like lightning-charged<br>clouds pouring rain on a mountain-breast. The heroic and valiant Sahadeva<br>then, O monarch, cut off, with a broad-headed arrow, the head of Uluka as<br>the latter advanced against him. Slain by Sahadeva, Uluka, gladdening the<br>Pandavas in that battle, fell down on the earth from his car, all his<br>limbs bathed in blood. Beholding his son slain, Shakuni, O Bharata, with<br>voice choked with tears and drawing deep breaths, recollected the words<br>of Vidura. Having reflected for a moment with tearful eyes, Shakuni,<br>breathing heavily, approached Sahadeva and pierced him with three arrows.<br>Baffling those arrows sped by Subala's son with showers of shafts, the<br>valiant Sahadeva, O monarch, cut off his antagonist's bow in that battle.<br>Seeing his bow cut off, O king, Shakuni, the son of Subala, took up a<br>formidable scimitar and hurled it at Sahadeva. The latter, however, with<br>the greatest ease, O monarch, cut off in twain that terrible scimitar of<br>Subala's son as it coursed towards him in that encounter. Beholding his<br>sword cut in twain, Shakuni took up a formidable mace and hurled it at<br>Sahadeva. That mace also, unable to achieve its object, fell down on the<br>Earth. After this, Subala's son, filled with rage, hurled at the son of<br>Pandu an awful dart that resembled an impending death night. With the<br>greatest ease Sahadeva, in that encounter, cut off, with his gold-decked<br>shafts, into three fragments, that dart as it coursed swiftly towards<br>him. Cut off into fragments, that dart adorned with gold fell down on the<br>earth like a blazing thunderbolt from the firmament, diverging into many<br>flashes. Beholding that dart baffled and Subala's son afflicted with<br>fear, all thy troops fled away in fright. Subala's son himself joined<br>them. The Pandavas then, eager for victory, uttered loud shouts. As<br>regards the Dhartarashtras, almost all of them turned away from the<br>fight. Seeing them so cheerless, the valiant son of Madri, with many<br>1,000 shafts, checked them in that battle. Then Sahadeva came upon<br>Subala's son as the latter, who was still expectant of victory, was<br>flying away, protected by the excellent cavalry of the Gandharas.<br>Recollecting, O king, that Shakuni, who had fallen to his share, was<br>still alive, Sahadeva, on his car adorned with gold, pursued that<br>warrior. Stringing his formidable bow and drawing it with great force,<br>Sahadeva, filled with rage, pursued the son of Subala and vigorously<br>struck him with many shafts equipped with vulturine feathers and whetted<br>on stone, even like a person striking a mighty elephant with pointed<br>lances. Endued with great energy of mind, Sahadeva, having afflicted his<br>foe thus, addressed him, as if for calling back to mind (his past<br>misdeeds), in these words, 'Adhering to the duties of a Kshatriya, fight<br>(with me) and be a man! Thou hadst, O fool, rejoiced greatly in the midst<br>of the assembly, while gambling with dice! Receive now, O thou of wicked<br>understanding, the fruit of that act! All those wicked-souled ones that<br>had ridiculed us then have perished! Only that wretch of his race,<br>Duryodhana, is still alive, and thyself, his maternal uncle! Today I<br>shall slay thee, striking off thy head with a razor-headed arrow like a<br>person plucking a fruit from a tree with a stick!" Saying these words, O<br>monarch, Sahadeva of great strength, that tiger among men, filled with<br>rage, rushed impetuously against Shakuni. Approaching his enemy, the<br>invincible Sahadeva, that foremost of warriors, forcibly drawing his bow<br>and as if burning his foe with wrath, pierced Shakuni with ten arrows and<br>his steeds with four. Then cutting off his umbrella and standard and bow,<br>he roared like a lion. His standard and bow and umbrella thus cut off by<br>Sahadeva, Subala's son was pierced with many arrows in all his vital<br>limbs. Once again, O monarch, the valiant Sahadeva sped at Shakuni an<br>irresistible shower of arrows. Filled with rage, the son of Subala then,<br>single-handed, rushed with speed against Sahadeva in that encounter,<br>desirous of slaying the latter with a lance adorned with gold. The son of<br>Madri, however, with three broad-headed arrows, simultaneously cut off,<br>without losing a moment, that uplifted lance as also the two well-rounded<br>arms of his enemy at the van of battle, and then uttered a loud roar.<br>Endued with great activity, the heroic Sahadeva then, with a broad-headed<br>arrow, made of hard iron, equipped with wings of gold, capable of<br>penetrating every armour, and sped with great force and care, cut off<br>from his trunk his enemy's head. Deprived of his head by the son of Pandu<br>with that gold-decked arrow of great sharpness and splendour like the<br>sun's, Subala's son fell down on the earth in that battle. Indeed, the<br>son of Pandu, filled with rage, struck off that head which was the root<br>of the evil policy of the Kurus, with that impetuous shaft winged with<br>gold and whetted on stone. Beholding Shakuni lying headless on the ground<br>and all his limbs drenched with gore, thy warriors, rendered powerless<br>with fear, fled away on all sides with weapons in their hands. At that<br>time, thy sons, with cars, elephants, horse and foot entirely broken,<br>heard the twang of Gandiva and fled away with colourless faces, afflicted<br>with fear and deprived of their senses. Having thrown down Shakuni from<br>his car, the Pandavas, O Bharata, became filled with delight. Rejoicing<br>with Keshava among them, they blew their conchs in that battle,<br>gladdening their troops. All of them, with glad hearts, worshipped<br>Sahadeva, and said, "By good luck, O hero, Shakuni of wicked soul, that<br>man of evil course, hath, with his son, been slain by thee!'"
