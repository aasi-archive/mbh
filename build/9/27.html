                            "Sanjaya said, 'Duryodhana, O king, and thy son Sudarsa, the only two of<br>thy children yet unslain, were at that time in the midst of the (Kaurava)<br>cavalry. Beholding Duryodhana staying in the midst of the cavalry,<br>Devaki's son (Krishna) said unto Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, "A large<br>number of our foes, kinsmen that had received our protection, have been<br>slain. There, that bull of Sini's race is returning, having taken Sanjaya<br>captive! Both Nakula and Sahadeva, O Bharata, are fatigued, having fought<br>with the wretched Dhartarashtras and their followers! Those three, Kripa<br>and Kritavarma and the mighty car-warrior Ashvatthama, have left<br>Duryodhana's side and taken up their position elsewhere! Having slain<br>Duryodhana's troops, the Pancala prince stayeth yonder, endued with great<br>beauty, in the midst of the Prabhadrakas. There, O Partha, Duryodhana<br>stayeth in the midst of his cavalry, with the umbrella held over his head<br>and himself flinging his glances all around! Having rearrayed the<br>(remnant of his) army, he stayeth in the midst of his forces. Slaying<br>this one with thy keen shafts, thou mayst achieve all thy objects! As<br>long as these troops do not fly away beholding thee, in their midst and<br>witnessing also the destruction of their elephant-force, do thou, O<br>chastiser of foes, endeavour to slay Duryodhana! Let somebody go to the<br>Pancala prince and ask him to come hither. The (Kaurava) troops are all<br>tired, O sire! The sinful Duryodhana will never succeed in escaping!<br>Having slain a large number of thy troops in battle, the son of<br>Dhritarashtra wears a proud aspect as if he believes that the Pandavas<br>have been vanquished! Beholding his own troops afflicted and slain by the<br>Pandavas, the Kuru king will certainly come to battle for his own<br>destruction!" Thus addressed by Krishna, Phalguna replied unto him,<br>saying. "Almost all the sons of Dhritarashtra, O giver of honours, have<br>been slain by Bhima! Only these two are yet alive! They, however, O<br>Krishna, shall also meet with destruction today! Bhishma hath been slain,<br>Drona hath been slain, Karna, otherwise called Vaikartana, hath been<br>slain! Shalya, the king of the Madras, hath been slain, and Jayadratha<br>also, O Krishna, hath been slain! Only five hundred horses from the<br>remnant of the troops of Shakuni, the son of Subala, and of cars, only<br>two hundred still remain, O Janardana! Of elephants there remain only a<br>hundred that are formidable, and of foot only 3,000! There remain also<br>Ashvatthama and Kripa and the ruler of the Trigartas and Uluka and<br>Kritavarma of the Satwata race. These, O Madhava, form the remnant of<br>Duryodhana's force! Truly, there is no escape from death for anybody on<br>Earth! Although such a tremendous carnage hast taken place, behold,<br>Duryodhana is still alive! Today king Yudhishthira, however, will be<br>freed from all his foes! None amongst the enemy will escape me, I ween!<br>Even if they be more than men, O Krishna, I shall yet slay all those<br>warriors today, however, furious in battle, if only they do not fly away<br>from the field! Filled with wrath in today's battle, I shall, by slaying<br>the prince of Gandhara with my keen shafts, dispel that sleeplessness<br>which the king has suffered from for a long time! I shall win back all<br>those valuable possessions which Subala's son, of wicked conduct, won<br>from us at the gambling match in the assembly! Hearing of the slaughter<br>of their husbands and sons at the hands of the Pandavas in battle, all<br>the ladies of the city called after the elephant will utter loud wails!<br>Today, O Krishna, our task will be ended! Today Duryodhana shall abandon<br>all his blazing prosperity, as also his life-breath. Thou mayest take the<br>foolish son of Dhritarashtra to be dead, O thou of Vrishni's race, if, O<br>Krishna, he does not today fly away from the battle to be waged by me!<br>Those steeds are incapable of enduring the twang of my bow and the slaps<br>of my palms! Proceed thither, O Krishna, for I will slay them!" Thus<br>addressed by Pandu's son of great force of mind, he of Dasarha's race<br>urged his steeds, O king, towards the division of Duryodhana. Beholding<br>that force (within which Duryodhana was), three mighty car-warriors<br>prepared themselves for assailing it, for Bhimasena and Arjuna and<br>Sahadeva, O sire, together proceeded against it with loud leonine roars<br>from desire of slaying Duryodhana. Beholding those three warriors rushing<br>quickly together with uplifted bows, Subala's son proceeded towards that<br>spot against those Pandava foes. Thy son Sudarsana rushed against<br>Bhimasena. Susarman and Shakuni encountered Kiritin. Thy son Duryodhana<br>on horse-back proceeded against Sahadeva. Then thy son, O ruler of men,<br>with great speed and care, forcibly struck Sahadeva's head with a lance.<br>Thus assailed by thy son, Sahadeva sat down on the terrace of his car,<br>all his limbs bathed in blood and himself sighing like a snake. Regaining<br>his senses then, O king, Sahadeva, filled with rage, covered Duryodhana<br>with keen arrows. Kunti's son, Dhananjaya, otherwise called Partha,<br>putting forth his prowess, cut off the heads of many brave combatants on<br>horse-back. Indeed, Partha, with many arrows, destroyed that (cavalry)<br>division. Having felled all the steeds, he then proceeded against the<br>cars of the Trigartas. At this, the great car-warriors of the Trigartas,<br>uniting together, covered Arjuna and Vasudeva with showers of shafts.<br>Assailing Satyakarman with a razor-headed arrow, the son of Pandu,<br>possessed of great fame, cut off his adversary's car-shafts. With another<br>razor-headed arrow, O lord, whetted on stone, that celebrated hero,<br>smiling the while, cut off his antagonist's head adorned with bright<br>gold. He next attacked Satyeshu in the sight of all the warriors, like a<br>hungry lion, O king, in the forest, attacking a deer. Having slain him,<br>Partha pierced Susarman with three arrows and then slew all those<br>car-warriors adorned with ornaments of gold. He then proceeded against<br>Susarman the ruler of Prashthala with great speed, vomiting the virulent<br>poison of his wrath cherished for many long years. Covering him first, O<br>bull of Bharata's race, with a hundred arrows, Arjuna then slew all the<br>steeds of that bowman. Fixing then on his bowstring a mighty arrow that<br>resembled the rod of Yama, Partha, smiling the while, quickly sped it at<br>Susarman, aiming it at him. Sped by that bowman blazing with wrath, that<br>arrow, reaching Susarman, pierced through his heart in that battle.<br>Deprived of life, O monarch, Susarman fell down on the Earth, gladdening<br>all the Pandavas and paining all thy warriors. Having slain Susarman in<br>that battle, Partha then, with his shafts, despatched the five and thirty<br>sons of that king, all of whom were great car-warriors, to Yama's abode.<br>Slaying next all the followers of Susarman with his keen arrows, the<br>mighty car-warrior, Arjuna, proceeded against the remnant of the Bharata<br>host. Bhima, in that battle, filled with rage, O ruler of men, made thy<br>son Sudarsana invisible with his arrows, and smiling the while, cut off<br>from his antagonist's trunk his head with a razor-headed arrow of great<br>sharpness. Deprived of life, the prince fell down on the Earth. Upon the<br>fall of that (Kuru) hero, his followers encompassed Bhima in that battle,<br>shooting showers of whetted arrows at him. Vrikodara, however, with his<br>keen arrows, whose touch resembled that of Indra's thunder, covered that<br>force around him. Within a very short time, Bhima slew them all, O bull<br>of Bharata's race! Whilst they were being thus exterminated, many Kaurava<br>leaders of great might, O Bharata, approached Bhima and began to fight<br>with him. The son of Pandu, O king, covered all of them with his arrows.<br>Similarly, thy warriors, O monarch, covered the great car-warriors of the<br>Pandavas with dense showers of arrows from every side. All the warriors<br>then, of both sides, thus engaged in battle with one another, became<br>exceedingly agitated. Struck by one another, the combatants of both<br>armies, O king, began to fall down, wailing aloud for their (deceased)<br>kinsmen.'"
