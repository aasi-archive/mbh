                            "Sanjaya said, 'When the loud noise of battle had somewhat subsided and<br>the Pandavas had slain large numbers of their foes, Subala's son (once<br>more) came for fight with the remnant of his horsemen numbering seven<br>hundred. Quickly approaching his own soldiers and urging them to battle,<br>he repeatedly said, "You chastisers of foes, fight cheerfully!" And he<br>asked the Kshatriyas present there, saying, "Where is the king, that<br>great car-warrior?" Hearing these words of Shakuni, O bull of Bharata's<br>race, they answered saying, "Yonder stayeth that great car-warrior, the<br>Kuru king, there where that large umbrella of splendour equal to that of<br>the full moon, is visible&#8212;there where those car-warriors, clad in mail,<br>are staying&#8212;there where that loud noise, deep as the roar of clouds, is<br>being heard! Proceed quickly thither, O king, and thou wilt then see the<br>Kuru monarch!" Thus addressed by those brave warriors, Subala's son<br>Shakuni, O king, proceeded to that spot where thy son was staying,<br>surrounded on all sides by unretreating heroes. Beholding Duryodhana<br>stationed in the midst of that car-force, Shakuni, gladdening all those<br>car-warriors of thine, O king cheerfully said these words unto<br>Duryodhana. Indeed, he said the following words in a manner which showed<br>that he regarded all his purposes to have been already achieved. "Slay, O<br>king, the car-divisions (of the Pandavas)! All their horses have been<br>vanquished by me! Yudhishthira is incapable of being conquered in battle<br>unless one is prepared to lay down his life! When that car-force,<br>protected by the son of Pandu, will have been destroyed, we shall then<br>slay all those elephants and foot-soldiers and others!" Hearing these<br>words of his, thy warriors, inspired with desire of victory, cheerfully<br>rushed towards the Pandava army. With quivers on their backs and bows in<br>their hands, all of them shook their bows and uttered leonine roars. Once<br>more, O king, the fierce twang of bows and the slapping of palms and the<br>whiz of arrows shot with force was heard. Beholding those Kuru combatants<br>approach the Pandava army with uplifted bows, Kunti's son Dhananjaya said<br>unto the son of Devaki these words, "Urge the steeds fearlessly and<br>penetrate this sea of troops! With my keen shafts I shall today reach the<br>end of these hostilities! Today is the eighteenth day, O Janardana, of<br>this great battle that is raging between the two sides! The army of those<br>high-souled heroes, which was literally numberless, hath been nearly<br>destroyed! Behold the course of Destiny! The army of Dhritarashtra's son,<br>O Madhava, which was vast as the ocean, hath, O Achyuta, become, after<br>encountering ourselves, even like the indent caused by a cow's hoof! If<br>peace had been made after Bhishma's fall, O Madhava, everything would<br>have been well! The foolish Duryodhana of weak understanding, however,<br>did not make peace! The words that were uttered by Bhishma, O Madhava,<br>were beneficial and worthy of adoption. Suyodhana, however, who had lost<br>his understanding, did not act according to them. After Bhishma had been<br>struck and thrown down on the Earth, I do not know the reason why the<br>battle proceeded! I regard the Dhartarashtras to be foolish and of weak<br>understanding in every way, since they continued the battle even after<br>the fall of Santanu's son! After that when Drona, that foremost of all<br>utterers of Brahma, fell, as also the son of Radha, and Vikarna, the<br>carnage did not still cease! Alas, when a small remnant only of the<br>(Kaurava) army remained after the fall of that tiger among men, Karna,<br>with his sons, the carnage did not still cease! After the fall of even<br>the heroic Srutayush, of also Jalasandha of Puru's race, and of king<br>Srutayudha, the carnage did not still cease! After the fall of<br>Bhurishrava, of Shalya, O Janardana, and of the Avanti heroes, the<br>carnage did not still cease! After the fall of Jayadratha, of the<br>Rakshasa Alayudha, of Bahlika, and of Somadatta, the carnage did not<br>still cease! After the fall of heroic Bhagadatta, of the Kamboja chief<br>Sadakshina, and of Duhshasana, the carnage did not still cease! Beholding<br>even diverse heroic and mighty kings, each owning extensive territories,<br>slain in battle, the carnage, O Krishna, did not still cease! Beholding<br>even a full Akshauhini of troops slain by Bhimasena in battle, the<br>carnage did not still cease, in consequence of either the folly or the<br>covetousness of the Dhartarashtras! What king born in a noble race, a<br>race especially like that of Kuru, save of course the foolish Duryodhana,<br>would thus fruitlessly wage such fierce hostilities? Who is there,<br>possessed of reason and wisdom and capable of discriminating good from<br>evil, that would thus wage war, knowing his foes to be superior to him in<br>merit, strength, and courage? How could he listen to the counsels of<br>another, when, indeed, he could not make up his mind to make peace with<br>the Pandavas in obedience to the words uttered by thee? What medicine can<br>be acceptable to that person today who disregarded Bhishma the son of<br>Santanu, and Drona, and Vidura, while they urged him to make peace? How<br>can he accept good counsels, who from folly, O Janardana, insolently<br>disregarded his own aged sire as also his own well-meaning mother while<br>speaking beneficial words unto him? It is evident, O Janardana, that<br>Duryodhana took his birth for exterminating his race! His conduct and his<br>policy, it is seen, point to that line, O lord! He will not give us our<br>kingdom yet! This is my opinion, O Achyuta! The high-souled Vidura, O<br>sire, told me many a time that as long as life remained in<br>Dhritarashtra's son, he would never give us our share of the kingdom!<br>Vidura further told me, 'As long also as Dhritarashtra will live, O giver<br>of honours, even that sinful wight will act sinfully towards you! Ye will<br>never succeed in vanquishing Duryodhana without battle!' Even thus, O<br>Madhava, did Vidura of true foresight often speak to me! All the acts of<br>that wicked-souled wight, I now find to be exactly as the high-souled<br>Vidura had said! That person of wicked understanding who, having listened<br>to the beneficial and proper words of Jamadagni's son, disregarded them,<br>should certainly be held as standing in the face of destruction. Many<br>persons crowned with ascetic success said as soon as Duryodhana was born,<br>that the entire Kshatriya order would be exterminated in consequence of<br>that wretch. Those words of the sages, O Janardana, are now being<br>realised, since the Kshatriyas are undergoing almost entire extermination<br>in consequence of Duryodhana's acts! I shall, O Madhava, slay all the<br>warriors today! After all the Kshatriyas will have been slain and the<br>(Kaurava) camp made empty, Duryodhana will then desire battle with us for<br>his own destruction. That will end these hostilities! Exercising my<br>reason, O Madhava, and reflected in my own mind, O thou of Vrishni's<br>race, thinking of Vidura's words, and taking into account the acts of the<br>wicked-souled Duryodhana himself, I have come to this conclusion!<br>Penetrate the Bharata army, O hero, for I shall slay the wicked-souled<br>Duryodhana and his army today with my keen shafts! Slaying this weak army<br>in the very sight of Dhritarashtra's son, I shall today do what is for<br>Yudhishthira's good!"'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed by Savyasaci, he of Dasarha's race,<br>reins in hand, fearlessly penetrated that vast hostile force for battle.<br>That was a terrible forest of bows (which the two heroes entered). Darts<br>constituted its prickles. Maces and spiked bludgeons were its paths. Cars<br>and elephants were its mighty trees. Cavalry and infantry were its<br>creepers. And the illustrious Keshava, as he entered that forest on that<br>car decked with many banners and pennons, looked exceedingly resplendent.<br>Those white steeds, O king, bearing Arjuna in battle, were seen careering<br>everywhere, urged by him of Dasarha's race! Then that scorcher of foes,<br>Savyasaci, proceeded on his car, shooting hundreds of keen shafts like a<br>cloud pouring showers of rain. Loud was the noise produced by those<br>straight arrows, as also by those combatants that were covered with them<br>in that battle by Savyasaci. Showers of shafts, piercing through the<br>armour of the combatants, fell down on the Earth. Impelled from Gandiva,<br>arrows, whose touch resembled that of Indra's thunder, striking men and<br>elephants and horses, O king, fell in that battle with a noise like that<br>of winged insects. Everything was shrouded with those shafts shot from<br>Gandiva. In that battle, the points of the compass, cardinal and<br>subsidiary, could not be distinguished. The whole world seemed to be<br>filled with gold-winged shafts, steeped in oil, polished by the hands of<br>the smith, and marked with Partha's name. Struck with those keen shafts,<br>and burnt therewith by Partha even as a herd of elephants is burnt with<br>burning brands, the Kauravas became languid and lost their strength.<br>Armed with bow and arrows, Partha, resembling the blazing sun, burnt the<br>hostile combatants in that battle like a blazing fire consuming a heap of<br>dry grass. As a roaring fire of blazing flames and great energy (arising<br>from embers) cast away on the confines of a forest by its denizens, fire<br>consumes those woods abounding with trees and heaps of dry creepers, even<br>so that hero possessed of great activity and fierce energy and endued<br>with prowess of weapons, and having shafts for his flames, quickly burnt<br>all the troops of thy son from wrath. His gold-winged arrows, endued with<br>fatal force and shot with care, could not be baffled by any armour. He<br>had not to shoot a second arrow at man, steed, or elephant of gigantic<br>size. Like the thunder-wielding Indra striking down the Daityas, Arjuna,<br>alone, entering that division of mighty car-warriors, destroyed it with<br>shafts of diverse forms.'"
