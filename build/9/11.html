                            Sanjaya said, "When the troops, slaughtered by one another, were thus<br>agitated, when many of the warriors fled away and the elephants began to<br>utter loud cries, when the foot-soldiers in that dreadful battle began to<br>shout and wail aloud, when the steeds, O king, ran in diverse directions,<br>when the carnage became awful, when a terrible destruction set in of all<br>embodied creatures, when weapons of various kinds fell or clashed with<br>one another, when cars and elephants began to be mangled together, when<br>heroes felt great delight and cowards felt their fears enhanced, when<br>combatants encountered one another from desire of slaughter, on that<br>awful occasion of the destruction of life, during the progress of that<br>dreadful sport, that is, of that awful battle that enhanced the<br>population of Yama's kingdom, the Pandavas slaughtered thy troops with<br>keen shafts, and, after the same manner, thy troops slew those of the<br>Pandavas.<br><br>During that battle inspiring the timid with terror, indeed, during the<br>progress of the battle as it was fought on that morning about the hour of<br>sunrise, the Pandava heroes of good aim, protected by the high-souled<br>Yudhishthira, fought with thy forces, making death itself their goal. The<br>Kuru army, O thou of the race of Kuru, encountering the proud Pandavas<br>endued with great strength, skilled in smiting, and possessed of sureness<br>of aim, became weakened and agitated like a herd of she-deer frightened<br>at a forest conflagration.<br><br>Beholding that army weakened and helpless like a cow sunk in mire,<br>Shalya, desirous of rescuing it, proceeded against the Pandava army.<br>Filled with rage, the ruler of the Madras, taking up an excellent bow,<br>rushed for battle against the Pandava foes. The Pandavas also, O monarch,<br>in that encounter, inspired with desire of victory, proceeded against the<br>ruler of the Madras and pierced him with keen shafts. Then the ruler of<br>the Madras, possessed of great strength, afflicted that host with showers<br>of keen arrows in the very sight of king Yudhishthira the just.<br><br>At that time diverse portents appeared to the view. The Earth herself,<br>with her mountains, trembled, making a loud noise. Meteors, with keen<br>points bright as those of lances equipped with handles, piercing the air,<br>fell upon the Earth from the firmament. Deer and buffaloes and birds, O<br>monarch, in large numbers, placed thy army to their right, O king. The<br>planets Venus and Mars, in conjunction with Mercury, appeared at the rear<br>of the Pandavas and to the front of all the (Kaurava) lords of Earth.<br>Blazing flames seemed to issue from the points of weapons, dazzling the<br>eyes (of the warriors). Crows and owls in large numbers perched upon the<br>heads of the combatants and on the tops of their standards. Then a fierce<br>battle took place between the Kaurava and the Pandava combatants,<br>assembled together in large bodies. Then, O king, the Kauravas, mustering<br>all their divisions, rushed against the Pandava army. Of soul incapable<br>of being depressed, Shalya then poured dense showers of arrows on<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti like the thousand-eyed Indra pouring rain<br>in torrents. Possessed of great strength, he pierced Bhimasena, and the<br>five sons of Draupadi and Dhristadyumna, the two sons of Madri by Pandu,<br>and the grandson of Sini, and Shikhandi also, each with ten arrows<br>equipped with wings of gold and whetted on stone. Indeed, he began to<br>pour his arrows like Maghavat (Indra) pouring rain at the close of the<br>summer season. Then the Prabhadrakas, O king, and the Somakas, were seen<br>felled or falling by thousands, in consequence of Shalya's arrows.<br>Multitudinous as swarms of bees or flights of locusts, the shafts of<br>Shalya were seen to fall like thunderbolts from the clouds. Elephants and<br>steeds and foot-soldiers and car-warriors, afflicted with Shalya's<br>arrows, fell down or wandered or uttered loud wails. Infuriate with rage<br>and prowess, the ruler of the Madras shrouded his foes in that battle<br>like Destroyer at the end of the Yuga. The mighty ruler of the Madras<br>began to roar aloud like the clouds. The Pandava army, thus slaughtered<br>by Shalya, ran towards Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti (for protection).<br>Possessed of great lightness of hand, Shalya, having in that battle<br>crushed them with whetted arrows, began to afflict Yudhishthira with a<br>dense shower of shafts. Beholding Shalya impetuously rushing towards him<br>with horsemen and foot-soldiers, king Yudhishthira, filled with wrath,<br>checked him with keen shafts, even as an infuriate elephant is checked<br>with iron-hooks. Then Shalya sped a terrible arrow at Yudhishthira that<br>resembled a snake of virulent poison. Piercing through the high-souled<br>son of Kunti, that arrow quickly fell down upon the Earth. Then<br>Vrikodara, filled with wrath, pierced Shalya with seven arrows, and<br>Sahadeva pierced him with five, and Nakula with ten. The (five) sons of<br>Draupadi poured upon that foe-slaying hero, the impetuous Artayani<br>(Shalya), showers of arrows like a mass of clouds pouring rain upon a<br>mountain. Beholding Shalya struck by the Parthas on every side, both<br>Kritavarma and Kripa rushed in wrath towards that spot. Uluka also of<br>mighty energy, and Shakuni the son of Subala, and the mighty car-warrior<br>Ashvatthama with smiles on his lips, and all thy sons protected Shalya by<br>every means in that battle. Piercing Bhimasena with three arrows,<br>Kritavarma, shooting a dense shower of shafts, checked that warrior who<br>then seemed to be the embodiment of wrath. Excited with rage, Kripa<br>struck Dhrishtadyumna with many arrows. Shakuni proceeded against the<br>sons of Draupadi, and Ashvatthama against the twins. That foremost of<br>warriors, Duryodhana, possessed of fierce energy, proceeded, in that<br>battle, against Keshava and Arjuna, and endued with might, he struck them<br>both with many arrows. Thus hundreds of combats, O monarch, that were<br>fierce and beautiful, took place between thy men and the enemy, on<br>diverse parts of the field. The chief of the Bhojas then slew the brown<br>steeds of Bhimasena's car in that encounter. The steedless son of Pandu,<br>alighting from his car, began to fight with his mace, like the Destroyer<br>himself with his uplifted bludgeon. The ruler of the Madras then slew the<br>steeds of Sahadeva before his eyes. Then Sahadeva slew Shalya's son with<br>his sword. The preceptor Gautama (Kripa) once more fearlessly fought with<br>Dhrishtadyumna, both exerting themselves with great care. The preceptor's<br>son Ashvatthama, without much wrath and as if smiling in that battle,<br>pierced each of the five heroic sons of Draupadi with ten arrows. Once<br>more the steeds of Bhimasena were slain in that battle. The steedless son<br>of Pandu, quickly alighting from his car, took up his mace like the<br>Destroyer taking his bludgeon. Excited with wrath, that mighty hero<br>crushed the steeds and the car of Kritavarma. Jumping down from his<br>vehicle, Kritavarma then fled away. Shalya also, excited with rage, O<br>king, slaughtered many Somakas and Pandavas, and once more afflicted<br>Yudhishthira with many keen shafts. Then the valiant Bhima, biting his<br>nether lip, and infuriate with rage, took up his mace in that battle, and<br>aimed it at Shalya for the latter's destruction. Resembling the very<br>bludgeon of Yama, impending (upon the head of the foe) like kala-ratri<br>(Death Night), exceedingly destructive of the lives of elephants and<br>steeds and human beings, twined round with cloth of gold, looking like a<br>blazing meteor, equipped with a sling, fierce as a she-snake, hard as<br>thunder, and made wholly of iron, smeared with sandal-paste and other<br>unguents like a desirable lady, smutted with marrow and fat and blood,<br>resembling the very tongue of Yama, producing shrill sounds in<br>consequence of the bells attached to it, like unto the thunder of Indra,<br>resembling in shape a snake of virulent poison just freed from its<br>slough, drenched with the juicy secretions of elephants, inspiring<br>hostile troops with terror and friendly troops with joy, celebrated in<br>the world of men, and capable of riving mountain summits, that mace, with<br>which the mighty son of Kunti had in Kailasa challenged the enraged Lord<br>of Alaka, the friend of Maheshvara, that weapon with which Bhima, though<br>resisted by many, had in wrath slain a large number of proud Guhyakas<br>endued with powers of illusion on the breasts of Gandhamadana for the<br>sake of procuring Mandara flowers for doing what was agreeable to<br>Draupadi, uplifting that mace which was rich with diamonds and jewels and<br>gems and possessed of eight sides and celebrated as Indra's thunder, the<br>mighty-armed son of Pandu now rushed against Shalya. With that mace of<br>awful sound, Bhima, skilled in battle, crushed the four steeds of Shalya<br>that were possessed of great fleetness. Then the heroic Shalya, excited<br>with wrath in that battle, hurled a lance at the broad chest of Bhima and<br>uttered a loud shout. That lance, piercing through the armour of Pandu's<br>son, presented into his body. Vrikodara, however, fearlessly plucking out<br>the weapon, pierced therewith the driver of Shalya in the chest. His<br>vitals pierced, the driver, vomiting blood, fell down with agitated<br>heart. At this, the ruler of the Madras came down from his car and<br>cheerlessly gazed at Bhima. Beholding his own feat thus counteracted,<br>Shalya became filled with wonder. Of tranquil soul, the ruler of the<br>Madras took up his mace and began to cast his glances upon his foe.<br>Beholding that terrible feat of his in battle, the Parthas, with cheerful<br>hearts, worshipped Bhima who was incapable of being tired with exertion.'"
