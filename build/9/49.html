                            Vaishampayana said, "The mighty chief of the Yadus, having proceeded to<br>Indra's tirtha, bathed there according to due rites and gave away wealth<br>and gems unto the Brahmanas. There the chief of the celestials had<br>performed a hundred horse sacrifices and given away enormous wealth unto<br>Brihaspati. Indeed, through the assistance of Brahmanas conversant with<br>the Vedas, Shakra performed all those sacrifices there, according to<br>rites ordained (in the scriptures). Those sacrifices were such that<br>everything in them was unstinted. Steeds of all kinds were brought there.<br>The gifts to Brahmanas were profuse. Having duly completed those hundred<br>sacrifices, O chief of the Bharatas, Shakra of great splendour came to be<br>called by the name of Satakratu. That auspicious and sacred tirtha,<br>capable of cleansing from every sin, thereupon came to be called after<br>his name as Indra-tirtha. Having duly bathed there, Baladeva worshipped<br>the Brahmanas with presents of excellent food and robes. He then<br>proceeded to that auspicious and foremost of tirthas called after the<br>name of Rama. The highly blessed Rama of Bhrigu's race, endued with great<br>ascetic merit, repeatedly subjugated the Earth and slew all the foremost<br>of Kshatriyas. (After achieving such feats) Rama performed in that tirtha<br>a Vajapeya sacrifice and a hundred horse sacrifices through the<br>assistance of his preceptor Kasyapa, that best of Munis. There, as<br>sacrificial fee, Rama gave unto his preceptor the whole earth with her<br>oceans. The great Rama, having duly bathed there, made presents unto the<br>Brahmanas, O Janamejaya, and worshipped them thus. Having made diverse<br>present consisting of diverse kinds of gems as also kine and elephants<br>and female slaves and sheep and goats, he then retired into the woods.<br>Having bathed in that sacred and foremost of tirthas that was the resort<br>of gods and regenerate Rishis, Baladeva duly worshipped the ascetics<br>there, and then proceeded to the tirtha called Yamuna. Endued with great<br>effulgence, Varuna, the highly blessed son of Aditi, had in days of yore<br>performed in that tirtha the Rajasuya sacrifice, O lord of Earth! Having<br>in battle subjugated both men and celestials and Gandharvas and<br>Rakshasas, Varuna, O king, that slayer of hostile heroes, performed his<br>grand sacrifice in that tirtha. Upon the commencement of that foremost of<br>sacrifices, a battle ensued between the gods and the Danavas inspiring<br>the three worlds with terror. After the completion of that foremost of<br>sacrifices, the Rajasuya (of Varuna), a terrible battle, O Janamejaya,<br>ensued amongst the Kshatriyas. The ever-liberal and puissant Baladeva<br>having worshipped the Rishis there, made many presents unto those that<br>desired them. Filled with joy and praised by the great Rishis, Baladeva,<br>that hero ever decked with garlands of wild flowers and possessed of eyes<br>like lotus leaves, then proceeded to the tirtha called Aditya. There, O<br>best of kings, the adorable Surya of great splendour, having performed a<br>sacrifice, obtained the sovereignty of all luminous bodies (in the<br>universe) and acquired also his great energy. There, in that tirtha<br>situated on the bank of that river, all the gods with Vasava at their<br>head, the Viswedevas, the Maruts, the Gandharvas, the Apsaras, the<br>Island-born (Vyasa), Suka, Krishna the slayer of Madhu, the Yakshas, the<br>Rakshasas, and the Pisachas, O king, and diverse others, numbering by<br>thousands, all crowned with ascetic success, always reside. Indeed in<br>that auspicious and sacred tirtha of the Sarasvati, Vishnu himself,<br>having in days of yore slain the Asuras, Madhu and Kaitabha, had, O chief<br>of the Bharatas, performed his ablutions. The island-born (Vyasa) also,<br>of virtuous soul, O Bharata, having bathed in that tirtha, obtained great<br>Yoga powers and attained to high success. Endued with great ascetic<br>merit, the Rishi Asita-Devala also, having bathed in that very tirtha<br>with soul rapt in high Yoga meditation, obtained great Yoga powers."
