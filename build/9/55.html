                            Vaishampayana said, "Even thus, O Janamejaya, did that terrible battle<br>take place. King Dhritarashtra, in great sorrow, said these words with<br>reference to it:<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Beholding Rama approach that spot when the<br>mace-fight was about to happen, how, O Sanjaya, did my son fight Bhima?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the presence of Rama, thy valiant son,<br>Duryodhana of mighty arms, desirous of battle, became full of joy. Seeing<br>the hero of the plough, king Yudhishthira, O Bharata, stood up and duly<br>honoured him, feeling great joy the while. He gave him a seat and<br>enquired about his welfare. Rama then answered Yudhishthira in these<br>sweet and righteous words that were highly beneficial to heroes, "I have<br>heard it said by the Rishis, O best of kings, that Kurukshetra is a<br>highly sacred and sin-cleansing spot, equal to heaven itself, adored by<br>gods and Rishis and high-souled Brahmanas! Those men that cast off their<br>bodies while engaged in battle on this field, are sure to reside, O sire,<br>in heaven with Shakra himself! I shall, for this, O king, speedily<br>proceed to Samantapanchaka. In the world of gods that spot is known as<br>the northern (sacrificial) altar of Brahman, the Lord of all creatures!<br>He that dies in battle on that eternal and most sacred of spots in the<br>three worlds, is sure to obtain heaven!" Saying, "So be it," O monarch,<br>Kunti's brave son, the lord Yudhishthira, proceeded towards<br>Samantapanchaka. King Duryodhana also, taking up his gigantic mace,<br>wrathfully proceeded on foot with the Pandavas. While proceeding thus,<br>armed with mace and clad in armour, the celestials in the welkin<br>applauded him, saying, "Excellent, Excellent!" The Charanas fleet as air,<br>seeing the Kuru king, became filled with delight. Surrounded by the<br>Pandavas, thy son, the Kuru king, proceeded, assuming the tread of an<br>infuriated elephant. All the points of the compass were filled with the<br>blare of conchs and the loud peals of drums and the leonine roars of<br>heroes. Proceeding with face westwards to the appointed spot, with thy<br>son (in their midst), they scattered themselves on every side when they<br>reached it. That was an excellent tirtha on the southern side of the<br>Sarasvati. The ground there was not sandy and was, therefore, selected<br>for the encounter. Clad in armour, and armed with his mace of gigantic<br>thickness, Bhima, O monarch, assumed the form of the mighty Garuda. With<br>head-gear fastened on his head, and wearing an armour made of gold,<br>licking the corners of his mouth, O monarch, with eyes red in wrath, and<br>breathing hard, thy son, on that field, O king, looked resplendent like<br>the golden Sumeru. Taking up his mace, king Duryodhana of great energy,<br>casting his glances on Bhimasena, challenged him to the encounter like an<br>elephant challenging a rival elephant. Similarly, the valiant Bhima,<br>taking up his adamantine mace, challenged the king like a lion<br>challenging a lion. Duryodhana and Bhima, with uplifted maces, looked in<br>that bottle like two mountains with tall summits. Both of them were<br>exceedingly angry; both were possessed of awful prowess; in encounters<br>with the mace both were disciples of Rohini's intelligent son, both<br>resembled each other in their feats and looked like Maya and Vasava. Both<br>were endued with great strength, both resembled Varuna in achievements.<br>Each resembling Vasudeva, or Rama, or Visravana's son (Ravana), they<br>looked, O monarch, like Madhu and Kaitabha. Each like the other in feats,<br>they looked like Sunda and Upasunda, or Rama and Ravana, or Vali and<br>Sugriva. Those two scorchers of foes looked like Kala and Mrityu. They<br>then ran towards each other like two infuriated elephants, swelling with<br>pride and mad with passion in the season of autumn and longing for the<br>companionship of a she-elephant in her time. Each seemed to vomit upon<br>the other the poison of his wrath like two fiery snakes. Those two<br>chastisers of foes cast the angriest of glances upon each other. Both<br>were tigers of Bharata's race, and each was possessed of great prowess.<br>In encounters with the mace, those two scorchers of foes were invincible<br>like lions. Indeed, O bull of Bharata's race, inspired with desire of<br>victory, they looked like two infuriated elephants. Those heroes were<br>unbearable, like two tigers accoutred with teeth and claws. They were<br>like two uncrossable oceans lashed into fury and bent upon the<br>destruction of creatures, or like two angry Suns risen for consuming<br>everything. Those two mighty car-warriors looked like an Eastern and a<br>Western cloud agitated by the wind, roaring awfully and pouring torrents<br>of rain in the rainy season. Those two high-souled and mighty heroes,<br>both possessed of great splendour and effulgence, looked like two Suns<br>risen at the hour of the universal dissolution. Looking like two enraged<br>tigers or like two roaring masses of clouds, they became as glad as two<br>maned lions. Like two angry elephants or two blazing fires, those two<br>high-souled ones appeared like two mountains with tall summits. With lips<br>swelling with rage and casting keen glances upon each other, those two<br>high-souled and best of men, armed with maces, encountered each other.<br>Both were filled with joy, and each regarded the other as a worthy<br>opponent, and Vrikodara then resembled two goodly steeds neighing at each<br>other, or two elephants trumpeting at each other. Those two foremost of<br>men then looked resplendent like a couple of Daityas swelling with might.<br>Then Duryodhana, O monarch, said these proud words unto Yudhishthira in<br>the midst of his brothers and of the high-souled Krishna and Rama of<br>immeasurable energy, 'Protected by the Kaikeyas and the Srinjayas and the<br>high-souled Pancalas, behold ye with all those foremost of kings, seated<br>together, this battle that is about to take place between me and Bhima!'<br>Hearing these words of Duryodhana, they did as requested. Then that large<br>concourse of kings sat down and was seen to look resplendent like a<br>conclave of celestials in heaven. In the midst of that concourse the<br>mighty-armed and handsome elder brother of Keshava, O monarch, as he sat<br>down, was worshipped by all around him. In the midst of those kings,<br>Valadeva clad in blue robes and possessed of a fair complexion, looked<br>beautiful like the moon at full surrounded in the night by thousands of<br>stars. Meanwhile those two heroes, O monarch, both armed with maces and<br>both unbearable by foes, stood there, goading each other with fierce<br>speeches. Having addressed each other in disagreeable and bitter words,<br>those two foremost of heroes of Kuru's race stood, casting angry glances<br>upon each other, like Shakra and Vritra in fight."
