                            "Sanjaya said, 'Taking up another bow that was very strong and much<br>tougher, the ruler of the Madras pierced Yudhishthira and roared like a<br>lion. Then that bull amongst Kshatriyas, of immeasurable soul, poured<br>upon all the Kshatriyas showers of arrows, even like the deity of the<br>clouds pouring rain in torrents. Piercing Satyaki with ten arrows and<br>Bhima with three and Sahadeva with as many, he afflicted Yudhishthira<br>greatly. And he afflicted all the other great bowmen with their steeds<br>and cars and elephants with many shafts like hunters afflicting elephants<br>with blazing brands. Indeed, that foremost of car-warriors destroyed<br>elephants and elephant-riders, horses and horsemen and cars and<br>car-warriors. And he cut off the arms of combatants with weapons in grasp<br>and the standards of vehicles, and caused the Earth to be strewn with<br>(slain) warriors like the sacrificial altar with blades of Kusa grass.<br>Then the Pandus, the Pancalas, and the Somakas, filled with rage,<br>encompassed that hero who was thus slaughtering their troops like<br>all-destroying Death. Bhimasena, and the grandson of Sini, and those two<br>foremost of men, the two sons of Madri, encompassed that warrior while he<br>was fighting with the (Pandava) king of terrible might. And all of them<br>challenged him to battle. Then those heroes, O king, having obtained the<br>ruler of the Madras, that foremost of warriors, in battle, checked that<br>first of men in that encounter and began to strike him with winged arrows<br>of fierce energy. Protected by Bhimasena, and by the two sons of Madri,<br>and by him of Madhu's race, the royal son of Dharma struck the ruler of<br>the Madras in the centre of the chest with winged arrows of fierce<br>energy. Then the car-warriors and other combatants of thy army, clad in<br>mail and equipped with weapons, beholding the ruler of the Madras<br>exceedingly afflicted with arrows in that battle, surrounded him on all<br>sides, at the command of Duryodhana. The ruler of the Madras at this time<br>quickly pierced Yudhishthira with seven arrows in that battle. The<br>high-souled son of Pritha, O king, in return, pierced his foe with nine<br>arrows in that dreadful encounter. Those two great car-warriors, the<br>ruler of the Madras and Yudhishthira, began to cover each other with<br>arrows, washed in oil and shot from their bowstrings stretched to their<br>ears. Those two best of kings, both endued with great strength, both<br>incapable of being defeated by foes, and both foremost of car-warriors,<br>watchful of each other's lapses, quickly and deeply pierced each other<br>with each other's shafts. The loud noise of their bows, bowstrings, and<br>palms resembled that of Indra's thunder as those high-souled warriors,<br>the brave ruler of the Madras and the heroic Pandava, showered upon each<br>other their numberless arrows. They careered on the field of battle like<br>two young tigers in the deep forest fighting for a piece of meat.<br>Swelling with pride of prowess, they mangled each other like a couple of<br>infuriate elephants equipped with powerful tusks. Then the illustrious<br>ruler of the Madras, endued with fierce impetuosity, putting forth his<br>vigour, pierced the heroic Yudhishthira of terrible might in the chest<br>with shaft possessed of the splendour of fire or the sun. Deeply pierced,<br>O king, that bull of Kuru's race, the illustrious Yudhishthira, then<br>struck the ruler of the Madras with a well-shot shaft and became filled<br>with joy. Recovering his senses within a trice, that foremost of kings<br>(Shalya), possessed of prowess equal to that of him of a 1,000 eyes, with<br>eyes red in wrath, quickly struck the son of Pritha with a hundred<br>arrows. At this, the illustrious son of Dharma filled with rage, quickly<br>pierced Shalya's chest and then, without losing a moment, struck his<br>golden mail with six shafts. Filled with joy, the ruler of the Madras<br>then, drawing his bow and having shot many arrows, at last cut off, with<br>a pair of razor-faced shafts, the bow of his royal foe, that bull of<br>Kuru's race. The illustrious Yudhishthira then, taking a new and more<br>formidable bow in that battle, pierced Shalya with many arrows of keen<br>points from every side like Indra piercing the Asura Namuchi. The<br>illustrious Shalya then, cutting off the golden coats of mail of both<br>Bhima and king Yudhishthira with nine arrows, pierced the arms of both of<br>them. With another razor-faced arrow endued with the splendour of fire or<br>the sun, he then cut off the bow of Yudhishthira. At this time Kripa,<br>with six arrows, slew the king's driver who thereupon fell down in front<br>of the car. The ruler of the Madras then slew with four shafts the four<br>steeds of Yudhishthira. Having slain the steeds of the king, the<br>high-souled Shalya then began to slay the troops of the royal son of<br>Dharma. When the (Pandava) king had been brought to that plight, the<br>illustrious Bhimasena, quickly cutting off the bow of the Madra king with<br>an arrow of great impetuosity, deeply pierced the king himself with a<br>couple of arrows. With another arrow he severed the head of Shalya's<br>driver from his trunk, the middle of which was encased in mail.<br>Exceedingly excited with rage, Bhimasena next slew, without a moment's<br>delay, the four steeds also of his foe. That foremost of all bowmen,<br>Bhima, then covered with a hundred arrows that hero (Shalya), who, endued<br>with great impetuosity, was careering alone in that battle. Sahadeva, the<br>son of Madri, also did the same. Beholding Shalya stupefied with those<br>arrows, Bhima cut off his armour with other shafts. His armour having<br>been cut off by Bhimasena, the high-souled ruler of the Madras, taking up<br>a sword and a shield decked with a 1,000 stars, jumped down from his car<br>and rushed towards the son of Kunti. Cutting off the shaft of Nakula's<br>car, Shalya of terrible strength rushed towards Yudhishthira. Beholding<br>Shalya rushing impetuously towards the king, even like the Destroyer<br>himself rushing in rage, Dhristadyumna and Shikhandi and the (five) sons<br>of Draupadi and the grandson of Sini suddenly advanced towards him. Then<br>the illustrious Bhima cut off with ten arrows the unrivalled shield of<br>the advancing hero. With another broad-headed arrow he cut off the sword<br>also of that warrior at the hilt. Filled with joy at this, he roared<br>aloud in the midst of the troops. Beholding that feat of Bhima, all the<br>foremost car-warriors among the Pandavas became filled with joy. Laughing<br>aloud, they uttered fierce roars and blew their conchs white as the moon.<br>At that terrible noise the army protected by thy heroes became cheerless,<br>covered with sweat, bathed in blood, exceedingly melancholy and almost<br>lifeless. The ruler of the Madras assailed by those foremost of Pandava<br>warriors headed by Bhimasena, proceeded (regardless of them) towards<br>Yudhishthira, like a lion proceeding for seizing a deer. King<br>Yudhishthira the just, steedless and driverless, looked like a blazing<br>fire in consequence of the wrath with which he was then excited.<br>Beholding the ruler of the Madras before him, he rushed towards that foe<br>with great impetuosity. Recollecting the words of Govinda, he quickly set<br>his heart on the destruction of Shalya. Indeed, king Yudhishthira the<br>just, staying on his steedless and driverless car, desired to take up a<br>dart. Beholding that feat of Shalya and reflecting upon the fact that the<br>hero who had been allotted to him as his share still remained unslain,<br>the son of Pandu firmly set his heart upon accomplishing that which<br>Indra's younger brother had counselled him to achieve. King Yudhishthira<br>the just, took up a dart whose handle was adorned with gold and gems and<br>whose effulgence was as bright as that of gold. Rolling his eyes that<br>were wide open, he cast his glances on the ruler of the Madras, his heart<br>filled with rage. Thus looked at, O god among men, by that king of<br>cleansed soul and sins all washed away, the ruler of the Madras was not<br>reduced to ashes. This appeared to us to be exceedingly wonderful, O<br>monarch. The illustrious chief of the Kurus then hurled with great force<br>at the king of the Madras that blazing dart of beautiful and fierce<br>handle and effulgent with gems and corals. All the Kauravas beheld that<br>blazing dart emitting sparks of fire as it coursed through the welkin<br>after having been hurled with great force, even like a large meteor<br>falling from the skies at the end of the Yuga. King Yudhishthira the<br>just, in that battle, carefully hurled that dart which resembled<br>kala-ratri (the Death Night) armed with the fatal noose or the<br>foster-mother of fearful aspect of Yama himself, and which like the<br>Brahmana's curse, was incapable of being baffled. Carefully the sons of<br>Pandu had always worshipped that weapon with perfumes and garlands and<br>foremost of seats and the best kinds of viands and drinks. That weapon<br>seemed to blaze like Samvartaka-fire and was as fierce as a rite<br>performed according to the Atharvan of Agnirasa. Created by Tvashtri (the<br>celestial artificer) for the use of Ishana, it was a consumer of the<br>life-breaths and the bodies of all foes. It was capable of destroying by<br>its force the Earth and the welkin and all the receptacles of water and<br>creatures of every kind. Adorned with bells and banners and gems and<br>diamonds and decked with stones of lapis lazuli and equipped with a<br>golden handle, Tvashtri himself had forged it with great care after<br>having observed many vows. Unerringly fatal, it was destructive of all<br>haters of Brahma. Having carefully inspired it with many fierce mantras,<br>and endued it with terrible velocity by the exercise of great might and<br>great care, king Yudhishthira hurled it along the best of tracks for the<br>destruction of the ruler of the Madras. Saying in a loud voice the words,<br>"Thou art slain, O wretch!" the king hurled it, even as Rudra had, in<br>days of yore, shot his shaft for the destruction of the asura Andhaka,<br>stretching forth his strong (right) arm graced with a beautiful hand, and<br>apparently dancing in wrath.<br><br>Shalya, however, roared aloud and endeavoured to catch that excellent<br>dart of irresistible energy hurled by Yudhishthira with all his might,<br>even as a fire leaps forth for catching a jet of clarified butter poured<br>over it. Piercing through his very vitals and his fair and broad chest,<br>that dart entered the Earth as easily as it would enter any water without<br>the slightest resistance and bearing away (with it) the world-wide fame<br>of the king (of the Madras). Covered with the blood that issued from his<br>nostrils and eyes and ears and mouth, and that which flowed from his<br>wound, he then looked like the Krauncha mountain of gigantic size when it<br>was pierced by Skanda. His armour having been cut off by that descendant<br>of Kuru's race, the illustrious Shalya, strong as Indra's elephant,<br>stretching his arms, fell down on the Earth, like a mountain summit riven<br>by thunder. Stretching his arms, the ruler of the Madras fell down on the<br>Earth, with face directed towards king Yudhishthira the just, like a tall<br>banner erected to the honour of Indra falling down on the ground. Like a<br>dear wife advancing to receive her dear lord about to fall on her breast,<br>the Earth then seemed, from affection, to rise a little for receiving<br>that bull among men as he fell down with mangled limbs bathed in blood.<br>The puissant Shalya, having long enjoyed the Earth like a dear wife, now<br>seemed to sleep on the Earth's breast, embracing her with all his limbs.<br>Slain by Dharma's son of righteous soul in fair fight, Shalya seemed to<br>assume the aspect of a goodly fire lying extinguished on the sacrificial<br>platform. Though deprived of weapons and standard, and though his heart<br>had been pierced, beauty did not yet seem to abandon the lifeless ruler<br>of the Madras. Then Yudhishthira, taking up his bow whose splendour<br>resembled that of Indra's bow, began to destroy his foes in that battle<br>like the prince of birds destroying snakes. With the greatest speed he<br>began to cut off the bodies of his enemies with his keen shafts. With the<br>showers of shafts that the son of Pritha then shot, thy troops became<br>entirely shrouded. Overcome with fear and with eyes shut, they began to<br>strike one another (so stupefied were they then). With blood issuing from<br>their bodies, they became deprived of their weapons of attack and defence<br>and divested of their life-breaths. Upon the fall of Shalya, the youthful<br>younger brother of the king of the Madras, who was equal to his<br>(deceased) brother in every accomplishment, and who was regarded as a<br>mighty car-warrior, proceeded against Yudhishthira. Invincible in battle<br>desirous of paying the last dues of his brother, that foremost of men<br>quickly pierced the Pandava with very many shafts. With great speed king<br>Yudhishthira the just pierced him with six arrows. With a couple of<br>razor-faced arrows, he then cut off the bow and the standard of his<br>antagonist. Then with a blazing and keen arrow of great force and broad<br>head, he struck off the head of his foe staying before him. I saw that<br>head adorned with earrings fall down from the car like a denizen of<br>heaven falling down on the exhaustion of his merits. Beholding his<br>headless trunk, bathed all over with blood, fallen down from the car, the<br>Kaurava troops broke. Indeed, upon the slaughter of the younger brother<br>of the Madras clad in beautiful armour, the Kurus, uttering cries of<br>"Oh!" and "Alas!" fled away with speed. Beholding Shalya's younger<br>brother slain, thy troops, hopeless of their lives, were inspired with<br>the fear of the Pandavas and fled, covered with dust. The grandson of<br>Sini then, Satyaki, O bull of Bharata's race, shooting his shafts,<br>proceeded against the frightened Kauravas while the latter were flying<br>away. Then Hridika's son, O king, quickly and fearlessly received that<br>invincible warrior, that irresistible and mighty bowman, as he advanced<br>(against the beaten army). Those two illustrious and invincible heroes of<br>Vrishni's race, Hridika's son and Satyaki, encountered each other like<br>two furious lions. Both resembling the sun in effulgence, they covered<br>each other with arrows of blazing splendour that resembled the rays of<br>the sun. The arrows of those two lions of Vrishni's race, shot forcibly<br>from their bows, we saw, looked like swiftly coursing insects in the<br>welkin. Piercing Satyaki with ten arrows and his steeds with three, the<br>son of Hridika cut off his bow with a straight shaft. Laying aside his<br>best of bows which was thus cut off, that bull of Sini's race, quickly<br>took up another that was tougher than the first. Having taken up that<br>foremost of bows, that first of bowmen pierced the son of Hridika with<br>ten arrows in the centre of the chest. Then cutting off his car and the<br>shaft also of that car with many well-shot arrows, Satyaki quickly slew<br>the steeds of his antagonist as also his two Parshni drivers. The valiant<br>Kripa then, the son of Saradwat, O lord, beholding Hridika's son made<br>carless, quickly bore him away, taking him up on his car. Upon the<br>slaughter of the king of the Madras and upon Kritavarma having been made<br>carless, the entire army of Duryodhana once more turned its face from the<br>battle. At this time the army was shrouded with a dusty cloud. We could<br>not see anything. The greater portion, however, of thy army fell. They<br>who remained alive had turned away their faces from battle. Soon it was<br>seen that that cloud of earthy dust which had arisen became allayed, O<br>bull among men, in consequence of the diverse streams of blood that<br>drenched it on every side. Then Duryodhana, seeing from a near point his<br>army broken, alone resisted all the Parthas advancing furiously.<br>Beholding the Pandavas on their cars as also Dhrishtadyumna the son of<br>Prishata and the invincible chief of the Anartas (Satyaki), the Kuru king<br>covered all of them with sharp arrows. The enemy (at that time)<br>approached him not, like mortal creatures fearing to approach the<br>Destroyer standing before them. Meanwhile the son of Hridika, riding upon<br>another car, advanced to that spot. The mighty car-warrior Yudhishthira<br>then quickly slew the four steeds of Kritavarma with four shafts, and<br>pierced the son of Gotama with six broad-headed arrows of great force.<br>Then Ashvatthama, taking up on his car the son of Hridika who had been<br>made steedless and carless by the (Pandava) king, bore him away from<br>Yudhishthira's presence. The son of Saradwat pierced Yudhishthira in<br>return with eight arrows and his steeds also with eight keen shafts.<br>Thus, O monarch, the embers of that battle began to glow here and there,<br>in consequence, O king, of the evil policy of thyself and thy son, O<br>Bharata. After the slaughter of that foremost of bowmen on the field of<br>battle by that bull of Kuru's race, the Parthas, beholding Shalya slain,<br>united together, and filled with great joy, blew their conchs. And all of<br>them applauded Yudhishthira in that battle, even as the celestials in<br>days of yore, had applauded Indra after the slaughter of Vritra. And they<br>beat and blew diverse kinds of musical instruments, making the Earth<br>resound on every side with that noise.'"
