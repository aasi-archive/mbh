                            (Gada-yuddha Parva)<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Thus admonished (by his foes), how, indeed, did<br>that scorcher of enemies, my heroic and royal son, who was wrathful by<br>nature, then behave? He had never before listened to admonitions such as<br>these! He had, again, been treated by all with the respect due to a king!<br>He, who had formerly grieved to stand in the shade of an umbrella,<br>thinking he had taken another's shelter, he, who could not endure the<br>very effulgence of the sun in consequence of his sensitive pride, how<br>could he endure these words of his foes? Thou hast, with thy own eyes, O<br>Sanjaya, seen the whole earth, with even her Mlecchas and nomad tribes,<br>depend upon his grace! Rebuked thus at that spot by the sons of Pandu in<br>particular, while lying concealed in such a solitary place after having<br>been deprived of his followers and attendants, alas, what answer did he<br>make unto the Pandavas upon hearing such bitter and repeated taunts from<br>his victorious enemies? Tell me everything, O Sanjaya, about it!'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus rebuked, O monarch, by Yudhishthira and his<br>brothers, thy royal son, lying within those waters, O king of kings,<br>heard those bitter words and became very miserable. Breathing hot and<br>long sighs repeatedly, the king waved his arms again and again, and<br>setting his heart on battle, thus answered, from within the waters, the<br>royal son of Pandu.<br><br>"'Duryodhana said, "Ye Parthas, all of you are possessed of friends, of<br>cars, and of animals! I, however, am alone, cheerless, without a car, and<br>without an animal! Being alone and destitute of weapons, how can I<br>venture to fight on foot, against numerous foes all well-armed and<br>possessed of cars? Do you, however, O Yudhishthira, fight me one at a<br>time! It is not proper that one should in battle fight many endued with<br>courage, especially when that one is without armour, fatigued, afflicted<br>with calamity, exceedingly mangled in his limbs, and destitute of both<br>animals and troops! I do not entertain the least fear, O monarch, of<br>either thee, or Vrikodara, the son of Pritha, or Phalguna, or Vasudeva,<br>or all the Pancalas, or the twins, or Yuyudhana, or all the other troops<br>thou hast! Standing in battle, alone as I am, I shall resist all of you!<br>The fame, O king, of all righteous men hath righteousness for its basis!<br>I say all this to you, observant of both righteousness and fame! Rising<br>(from this lake), I shall fight all of you in battle! Like the year that<br>gradually meets all the seasons, I shall meet all of you in fight! Wait,<br>ye Pandavas! Like the sun destroying by his energy the light of all stars<br>at dawn, I shall today, though weaponless and carless, destroy all of you<br>possessed of cars and steeds! Today I shall free myself from the debt I<br>owe to the many illustrious Kshatriyas (that have fallen for me), to<br>Bahlika and Drona and Bhishma and the high-souled Karna, to the heroic<br>Jayadratha and Bhagadatta, to Shalya the ruler of the Madras and<br>Bhurishrava, to my sons, O chief of Bharata's race, and Shakuni the son<br>of Subala, to all my friends and well-wishers and kinsmen! Today I shall<br>free myself from that debt by slaying thee with thy brothers!" With these<br>words, the (Kuru) king ceased speaking.<br><br>"'Yudhishthira said, "By good luck, O Suyodhana, thou knowest the duties<br>of a Kshatriya! By good luck, O thou of mighty arms, thy heart inclineth<br>to battle! By good luck, thou art a hero, O thou of Kuru's race, and, by<br>good luck, thou art conversant with battle, since, single-handed, thou<br>wishest to meet all of us in battle! Fight any one of us, taking whatever<br>weapon thou likest! All of us will stand as spectators here! I grant thee<br>also, O hero, this (other) wish of thy heart, that if thou slayest any of<br>us, thou shalt then become king! Otherwise, slain by us, go to heaven!"<br><br>"'Duryodhana said, "A brave man as thou art, if thou grantest me the<br>option of fighting only one of you, this mace that I hold in my hand is<br>the weapon that I select! Let any one amongst you who thinks that he will<br>be my match come forward and fight with me on foot, armed with mace! Many<br>wonderful single combats have occurred on cars! Let this one great and<br>wonderful combat with the mace happen today! Men (while fighting) desire<br>to change weapons. Let the manner of the fight be changed today, with thy<br>permission! O thou of mighty arms, I shall, with my mace, vanquish thee<br>today with all thy younger brothers, as also all the Pancalas and the<br>Srinjayas and all the other troops thou still hast! I do not cherish the<br>least fear, O Yudhishthira, of even Shakra himself!'<br><br>"'Yudhishthira said, "Rise, rise, O son of Gandhari, and fight me,<br>Suyodhana! Alone as thou art, fight us, encountering one at a time, thou<br>of great might, armed with thy mace! Be a man, O son of Gandhari, and<br>fight with good care! Today thou shalt have to lay down thy life even if<br>Indra becomes thy ally!"<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'That tiger among men, thy son, could not bear these<br>words of Yudhishthira. He breathed long and heavy sighs from within the<br>water like a mighty snake from within its hole. Struck repeatedly with<br>such wordy goads, he could not endure it at all, like a horse of high<br>breed that cannot endure the whip. Agitating the waters with great force,<br>that valiant warrior rose like a prince of elephants from within the<br>lake, breathing heavily in rage, and armed with his heavy mace that was<br>endued with the strength of adamant and decked with gold. Piercing the<br>solidified waters, thy son rose, shouldering his mace of iron, like the<br>sun himself scorching everything with his rays. Endued with great<br>strength, thy son, possessed of great intelligence, began to handle his<br>heavy mace made of iron and equipped with a sling. Beholding him armed<br>with mace and resembling a crested mountain or the trident-wielding Rudra<br>himself casting angry glances on living creatures, they observed that<br>Bharata chief shedding an effulgence around like the scorching sun<br>himself in the sky. Indeed, all creatures then regarded that mighty-armed<br>chastiser of foes, as he stood shouldering his mace after rising from the<br>waters, looking like the Destroyer himself armed with his bludgeon.<br>Indeed, all the Pancalas then saw thy royal son to look like the<br>thunder-wielding Shakra or the trident-bearing Hara. Seeing him, however,<br>rise from within the waters, all the Pancalas and the Pandavas began to<br>rejoice and seize each other's hands. Thy son Duryodhana regarded that<br>action of the spectators to be an insult directed towards him. Rolling<br>his eyes in wrath, and as if burning the Pandavas with his glances, and<br>contracting his brow into three furrows, and repeatedly biting his nether<br>lip, he addressed the Pandavas with Keshava in their midst, saying, "You<br>Pandavas, you shall have to bear the fruit of these taunts! Slain by me<br>today, you shall, with the Pancalas, have to repair to the abode of<br>Yama!"'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Rising from the water, thy son Duryodhana stood<br>there, armed with mace, and with limbs bathed in blood. Covered with<br>blood and drenched with water, his body then looked like a mountain<br>shedding water from within. As he stood armed with mace, the Pandavas<br>regarded him to be the angry son of Surya himself armed with the bludgeon<br>called Kinkara. With voice deep as that of the clouds or of a bull<br>roaring in joy, Duryodhana then, of great prowess, armed with his mace,<br>summoned the Parthas to battle.'<br><br>"'Duryodhana said, "You will have, O Yudhishthira, to encounter me one at<br>a time! It is not proper, that one hero should fight with many at the<br>same time, especially when that single warrior is divested of armour,<br>fatigued with exertion, covered with water, exceedingly mangled in limbs,<br>and without cars, animals and troops! Let the gods in heaven behold me<br>fight single-handed destitute of all equipment and deprived of even<br>armour and weapons! I shall certainly fight all of you! Thou shalt be<br>judge, as thou hast the necessary qualifications, of the propriety and<br>impropriety of everything!"<br><br>"'Yudhishthira said, "How is it, O Duryodhana, that thou hadst not this<br>knowledge when many great car-warriors, uniting together, slew Abhimanyu<br>in battle? Kshatriya duties are exceedingly cruel, unmindful of all<br>considerations, and without the least compassion! Otherwise, how could<br>you slay Abhimanyu under those circumstances? All of you were acquainted<br>with righteousness! All of you were heroes! All of you were prepared to<br>lay down your lives in battle! The high end declared for those that fight<br>righteously is the attainment of the regions of Shakra! If this be your<br>duty, that one should never be slain by many, why is it then that<br>Abhimanyu was slain by many, acting in accord with thy counsels? All<br>creatures, when in difficulty forget considerations of virtue. They then<br>view the gates of the other world to be closed. Put on armour, O hero,<br>and bind thy locks! Take everything else, O Bharata, of which thou<br>standest in need! This another wish of thine, O hero, I grant thee in<br>addition, that if thou canst slay him amongst the five Pandavas with whom<br>thou wishest an encounter, thou shalt then be king! Otherwise, slain (by<br>him), thou shalt proceed to heaven! Except thy life, O hero, tell us what<br>boon we may grant thee."<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Then thy son, O king, cased his body with armour<br>made of gold, and put on a beautiful head-gear adorned with pure gold.<br>Clad in bright armour of gold, he put on that head-gear. Indeed, O king,<br>thy son then looked resplendent like a golden cliff. Clad in mail, armed<br>with mace, and accoutred with other equipments, thy son Duryodhana then,<br>O king, standing on the field of battle, addressed all the Pandavas,<br>saying, 'Amongst you (five) brothers, let any one fight me, armed with<br>mace! As regards myself, I am willing to fight either Sahadeva, or Bhima,<br>or Nakula, or Phalguna, or thee today, O bull of Bharata's race! Accorded<br>an encounter, I will fight any one amongst you and will certainly gain<br>the victory on the field! Today I will reach the end of these hostilities<br>that is difficult to reach, with the aid, O tiger among men, of my mace<br>wrapped with cloth of gold. I think, there is none to be my match in an<br>encounter with the mace! With my mace I shall slay all of you one after<br>another! Amongst all of you there is no one who is competent to fight<br>fairly with me! It is not proper for me to speak such words of pride with<br>respect to my own self! I shall, however, make these words of mine true<br>in your presence! Within this very hour, these words will become either<br>true or false! Let him amongst you take up the mace that will fight with<br>me!'"
