                            "Sanjaya said, 'Meanwhile Arjuna, in that battle, pierced with many<br>arrows by the son of Drona as also by the latter's followers, the heroic<br>and mighty car-warriors among the Trigartas, pierced Drona's son in<br>return with three shafts, and each of the other warriors with two. Once<br>again, the mighty-armed Dhananjaya covered his enemies with showers of<br>shafts. Though struck with keen arrows and though they looked like<br>porcupines in consequence of those arrows sticking to their limbs, still<br>thy troops, O bull of Bharata's race, fled not from Partha in that<br>battle. With Drona's son at their head, they encompassed that mighty<br>car-warrior and fought with him, shooting showers of shafts. The<br>gold-decked arrows, O king, shot by them, speedily filled the terrace of<br>Arjuna's car. Beholding those two great bowmen, those two foremost of all<br>warriors, the two Krishnas, covered with arrows, those invincible<br>(Kaurava) combatants became filled with delight. Indeed, at that time,<br>the Kuvara, the wheels, the shaft, the traces, the yoke, and the<br>Anukarsha, O lord, of Arjuna's car, became entirely enveloped with<br>arrows. The like of what thy warriors then did unto Partha had never<br>before, O king, been either seen or heard. That car looked resplendent<br>with those keen arrows of beautiful wings like a celestial vehicle<br>blazing with hundreds of torches dropped on the Earth. Then Arjuna, O<br>monarch, covered that hostile division with showers of straight shafts<br>like a cloud pouring torrents of rain on a mountain. Struck in that<br>battle with arrows inscribed with Partha's name, those warriors,<br>beholding that state of things, regarded the field of battle to be full<br>of Parthas. Then the Partha-fire, having for its wonderful flames and the<br>loud twang of Gandiva for the wind that fanned it, began to consume the<br>fuel constituted by thy troops. Then, O Bharata, heaps of fallen wheels<br>and yokes, of quivers, of banners and standards, with the vehicles<br>themselves that bore them, of shafts and Anukarshas and Trivenus, of<br>axles and traces and goads, of heads of warriors decked with earrings and<br>headgears, of arms, O monarch, and thighs in thousands of umbrellas along<br>with fans, and of diadems and crowns, were seen along the tracks of<br>Partha's car. Indeed, along the track of the angry Partha's car, O<br>monarch, the ground, miry with blood, became impassable, O chief of the<br>Bharatas, like the sporting ground of Rudra. The scene inspired the timid<br>with fear and the brave with delight. Having destroyed 2,000 cars with<br>their fences, that scorcher of foes, Partha, looked like a smokeless fire<br>with blazing flames. Indeed, even as the illustrious Agni when he blazes<br>forth (at the end of the Yuga) for destroying the mobile and the immobile<br>universe, even so looked, O king, the mighty car-warrior Partha.<br>Beholding the prowess of Pandu's son in that battle, the son of Drona, on<br>his car equipped with many banners, endeavoured to check him. Those two<br>tigers among men, both having white steeds yoked unto their vehicles and<br>both regarded as the foremost of car-warriors, quickly encountered each<br>other, each desirous of slaying the other. The arrowy showers shot by<br>both became exceedingly terrible and were as dense, O bull of Bharata's<br>race, as the torrents of rain poured by two masses of clouds at the close<br>of summer. Each challenging the other, those two warriors mangled each<br>other with straight shafts in that battle, like a couple of bulls tearing<br>each other with their horns. The battle between them, O king, was fought<br>equally for a long while. The clash of weapons became terrific. The son<br>of Drona then, O Bharata, pierced Arjuna with a dozen gold-winged arrows<br>of great energy and Vasudeva with ten. Having shown for a short while<br>some regard for the preceptor's son in that great battle, Vibhatsu then,<br>smiling the while, stretched his bow Gandiva with force. Soon, however,<br>the mighty car-warrior Savyasaci (Arjuna) made his adversary steedless<br>and driverless and carless, and without putting forth much strength<br>pierced him with three arrows. Staying on that steedless car, Drona's<br>son, smiling the while, hurled at the son of Pandu a heavy mallet that<br>looked like a dreadful mace with iron-spikes. Beholding that weapon,<br>which was decked with cloth of gold, coursing towards him, the heroic<br>Partha, that slayer of foes, cut it off into seven fragments. Seeing his<br>mallet cut off, Drona's son of great wrath took up a terrible mace<br>equipped with iron spikes and looking like a mountain summit.<br>Accomplished in battle, the son of Drona hurled it then at Partha.<br>Beholding that spiked mace coursing towards him like the Destroyer<br>himself in rage, Pandu's son Arjuna quickly cut it off with five<br>excellent shafts. Cut off with Partha's shafts in that great battle, that<br>weapon fell down on the Earth, riving the hearts, as it were, O Bharata,<br>of the (hostile) kings. The son of Pandu then pierced Drona's son with<br>three other shafts. Though deeply pierced by the mighty Partha, Drona's<br>son, however, of great might, relying upon his own manliness, showed no<br>sign of fear or agitation. That great car-warrior, the son of Drona,<br>then, O king, shrouded Suratha (the Pancala) with showers of shafts<br>before the eyes of all the Kshatriyas. At this, Suratha, that great<br>car-warrior among the Pancalas, in that battle, riding upon his car whose<br>rattle was as deep as the roar of the clouds rushed against the son of<br>Drona. Drawing his foremost of bows, firm and capable of bearing a great<br>strain, the Pancala hero covered Ashvatthama with arrows that resembled<br>flames of fire or snakes of virulent poison. Seeing the great car-warrior<br>Suratha rushing towards him in wrath, the son of Drona became filled with<br>rage like a snake struck with a stick. Furrowing his brow into three<br>lines, and licking the corners of his mouth with his tongue, he looked at<br>Suratha in rage and then rubbed his bow-string and sped a keen cloth-yard<br>shaft that resembled the fatal rod of Death. Endued with great speed,<br>that shaft pierced the heart of Suratha and passing out entered the<br>Earth, riving her through, like the thunderbolt of Shakra hurled from the<br>sky. Struck with that shaft, Suratha fell down on the Earth like a<br>mountain summit riven with thunder. After the fall of that hero, the<br>valiant son of Drona, that foremost of car-warriors speedily mounted upon<br>the vehicle of his slain foe. Then, O monarch, that warrior, invincible<br>in battle, the son of Drona, well-equipped with armour and weapons, and<br>supported by the Samsaptakas, fought with Arjuna. That battle, at the<br>hour of noon, between one and the many, enhancing the population of<br>Yama's domains, became exceedingly fierce. Wonderful was the sight that<br>we then beheld, for, noticing the prowess of all those combatants,<br>Arjuna, alone and unsupported, fought with his foes at the same time. The<br>encounter was exceedingly fierce that thus took place between Arjuna and<br>his enemies, resembling that between Indra, in days of yore, and the vast<br>host of the Asuras.'"
