                            "Sanjaya said, 'Duryodhana, with heart undepressed, beholding Bhimasena<br>in that state, rushed furiously against him, uttering a loud roar. They<br>encountered each other like two bulls encountering each other with their<br>horns. The strokes of their maces produced loud sounds like those of<br>thunderbolts. Each longing for victory, the battle that took place<br>between them was terrible, making the very hair stand on end, like that<br>between Indra and Prahlada. All their limbs bathed in blood, the two<br>high-souled warriors of great energy, both armed with maces, looked like<br>two Kinsukas decked with flowers. During the progress of that great and<br>awful encounter, the welkin looked beautiful as if it swarmed with<br>fire-flies. After that fierce and terrible battle had lasted for some<br>time, both those chastisers of foes became fatigued. Having rested for a<br>little while, those two scorchers of foes, taking up their handsome<br>maces, once again began to ward off each others' attacks. Indeed, when<br>those two warriors of great energy, those two foremost of men, both<br>possessed of great might, encountered each other after having taken a<br>little rest, they looked like two elephants infuriated with passion and<br>attacking each other for obtaining the companionship of a cow elephant in<br>season. Beholding those two heroes, both armed with maces and each equal<br>to the other in energy, the gods and Gandharvas and men became filled<br>with wonder. Beholding Duryodhana and Vrikodara both armed with maces,<br>all creatures became doubtful as to who amongst them would be victorious.<br>Those two cousins, those two foremost of mighty men, once again rushing<br>at each other and desiring to take advantage of each other's lapses,<br>waited each watching the other. The spectators, O king, beheld each armed<br>with his uplifted mace, that was heavy, fierce, and murderous, and that<br>resembled the bludgeon of Yama or the thunder-bolt of Indra. While<br>Bhimasena whirled his weapon, loud and awful was the sound that it<br>produced. Beholding his foe, the son of Pandu, thus whirling his mace<br>endued with unrivalled impetuosity, Duryodhana became filled with<br>amazement. Indeed, the heroic Vrikodara, O Bharata, as he careered in<br>diverse courses, presented a highly beautiful spectacle. Both bent upon<br>carefully protecting themselves, as they approached, they repeatedly<br>mangled each other like two cats fighting for a piece of meat. Bhimasena<br>performed diverse kinds of evolutions. He coursed in beautiful circles,<br>advanced, and receded. He dealt blows and warded off those of his<br>adversary, with wonderful activity. He took up various kinds of position<br>(for attack and defence). He delivered attacks and avoided those of his<br>antagonist. He ran at his foe, now turning to the right and now to the<br>left. He advanced straight against the enemy. He made ruses for drawing<br>his foe. He stood immovable, prepared for attacking his foe as soon as<br>the latter would expose himself to attack. He circumambulated his foe,<br>and prevented his foe from circumambulating him. He avoided the blows of<br>his foe by moving away in bent postures or jumping aloft. He struck,<br>coming up to his foe face to face, or dealt back-thrusts while moving<br>away from him. Both accomplished in encounters with the mace, Bhima and<br>Duryodhana thus careered and fought, and struck each other. Those two<br>foremost ones of Kuru's race careered thus, each avoiding the other's<br>blows. Indeed, those two mighty warriors thus coursed in circles and<br>seemed to sport with each other. Displaying in that encounter their skill<br>in battle, those two chastisers of foes sometimes suddenly attacked each<br>other with their weapons, like two elephants approaching and attacking<br>each other with their tusks. Covered with blood, they looked very<br>beautiful, O monarch, on the field. Even thus occurred that battle,<br>awfully and before the gaze of a large multitude, towards the close of<br>the day, like the battle between Vritra and Vasava. Armed with maces,<br>both began to career in circles. Duryodhana, O monarch, adopted the right<br>mandala, while Bhimasena adopted the left mandala. While Bhima was thus<br>careering in circles on the field of battle, Duryodhana, O monarch,<br>suddenly struck him a fierce blow on one of his flanks. Struck by thy<br>son, O sire, Bhima began to whirl his heavy mace for returning that blow.<br>The spectators, O monarch, beheld that mace of Bhimasena look as terrible<br>as Indra's thunder-bolt or Yama's uplifted bludgeon. Seeing Bhima whirl<br>his mace, thy son, uplifting his own terrible weapon, struck him again.<br>Loud was the sound, O Bharata, produced by the descent of thy son's mace.<br>So quick was that descent that it generated a flame of fire in the<br>welkin. Coursing in diverse kinds of circles, adopting each motion at the<br>proper time, Suyodhana, possessed of great energy, once more seemed to<br>prevail over Bhima. The massive mace of Bhimasena meanwhile, whirled with<br>his whole force, produced a loud sound as also smoke and sparks and<br>flames of fire. Beholding Bhimasena whirling his mace, Suyodhana also<br>whirled his heavy and adamantine weapon and presented a highly beautiful<br>aspect. Marking the violence of the wind produced by the whirl of<br>Duryodhana's mace, a great fear entered the hearts of all the Pandus and<br>the Somakas. Meanwhile those two chastisers of foes, displaying on every<br>side their skill in battle, continued to strike each other with their<br>maces, like two elephants approaching and striking each other with their<br>tusks. Both of them, O monarch, covered with blood, looked highly<br>beautiful. Even thus progressed that awful combat before the gaze of<br>thousands of spectators at the close of day, like the fierce battle that<br>took place between Vritra and Vasava. Beholding Bhima firmly stationed on<br>the field, thy mighty son, careering in more beautiful motions, rushed<br>towards that son of Kunti. Filled with wrath, Bhima struck the mace,<br>endued with great impetuosity and adorned with gold, of the angry<br>Duryodhana. A loud sound with sparks of fire was produced by that clash<br>of the two maces which resembled the clash of two thunder-bolts from<br>opposite directions. Hurled by Bhimasena, his impetuous mace, as it fell<br>down, caused the very earth to tremble. The Kuru prince could not brook<br>to see his own mace thus baffled in that attack. Indeed, he became filled<br>with rage like an infuriated elephant at the sight of a rival elephant.<br>Adopting the left mandala, O monarch, and whirling his mace, Suyodhana<br>then, firmly resolved, struck the son of Kunti on the head with his<br>weapon of terrible force. Thus struck by thy son, Bhima, the son of<br>Pandu, trembled not, O monarch, at which all the spectators wondered<br>exceedingly. That amazing patience, O king, of Bhimasena, who stirred not<br>an inch though struck so violently, was applauded by all the warriors<br>present there. Then Bhima of terrible prowess hurled at Duryodhana his<br>own heavy and blazing mace adorned with gold. That blow the mighty and<br>fearless Duryodhana warded off by his agility. Beholding this, great was<br>the wonder that the spectators felt. That mace, hurled by Bhima, O king,<br>as it fell baffled of effect, produced a loud sound like that of the<br>thunderbolt and caused the very earth to tremble. Adopting the manoeuvre<br>called Kausika, and repeatedly jumping up, Duryodhana, properly marking<br>the descent of Bhima's mace, baffled the latter. Baffling Bhimasena thus,<br>the Kuru king, endued with great strength, at last in rage struck the<br>former on the chest. Struck very forcibly by thy son in that dreadful<br>battle, Bhimasena became stupefied and for a time knew not what to do. At<br>that time, O king, the Somakas and the Pandavas became greatly<br>disappointed and very cheerless. Filled with rage at that blow, Bhima<br>then rushed at thy son like an elephant rushing against an elephant.<br>Indeed, with uplifted mace, Bhima rushed furiously at Duryodhana like a<br>lion rushing against a wild elephant. Approaching the Kuru king, the son<br>of Pandu, O monarch, accomplished in the use of the mace, began to whirl<br>his weapon, taking aim at thy son. Bhimasena then struck Duryodhana on<br>one of his flanks. Stupefied at that blow, the latter fell down on the<br>earth, supporting himself on his knees. When that foremost one of Kuru's<br>race fell upon his knees, a loud cry arose from among the Srinjayas, O<br>ruler of the world! Hearing that loud uproar of the Srinjayas, O bull<br>among men, thy son became filled with rage. The mighty-armed hero, rising<br>up, began to breathe like a mighty snake, and seemed to burn Bhimasena by<br>casting his glances upon him. That foremost one of Bharata's race then<br>rushed at Bhimasena, as if he would that time crush the head of his<br>antagonist in that battle. The high-souled Duryodhana of terrible prowess<br>then struck the high-souled Bhimasena on the forehead. The latter,<br>however, moved not an inch but stood immovable like a mountain. Thus<br>struck in that battle, the son of Pritha, O monarch, looked beautiful, as<br>he bled profusely, like an elephant of rent temples with juicy secretions<br>trickling adown. The elder brother of Dhananjaya, then, that crusher of<br>foes, taking up his hero-slaying mace made of iron and producing a sound<br>loud as that of the thunder-bolt, struck his adversary with great force.<br>Struck by Bhimasena, thy son fell down, his frame trembling all over,<br>like a gigantic Sala in the forest, decked with flowers, uprooted by the<br>violence of the tempest. Beholding thy son prostrated on the earth, the<br>Pandavas became exceedingly glad and uttered loud cries. Recovering his<br>consciousness, thy son then rose, like an elephant from a lake. That ever<br>wrathful monarch and great car-warrior then careering with great skill,<br>struck Bhimasena who was standing before him. At this, the son of Pandu,<br>with weakened limbs, fell down on the earth.<br><br>"Having by his energy prostrated Bhimasena on the ground, the Kuru prince<br>uttered a leonine roar. By the descent of his mace, whose violence<br>resembled that of the thunder, he had fractured Bhima's coat of mail. A<br>loud uproar was then heard in the welkin, made by the denizens of heaven<br>and the Apsaras. A floral shower, emitting great fragrance, fell, rained<br>by the celestials. Beholding Bhima prostrated on the earth and weakened<br>in strength, and seeing his coat of mail laid open, a great fear entered<br>the hearts of our foes. Recovering his senses in a moment, and wiping his<br>face which had been dyed with blood, and mustering great patience,<br>Vrikodara stood up, with rolling eyes steadying himself with great<br>effort."
