                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the fallen boxes of cars, as also the cars of<br>high-souled warriors, and the elephants and foot-soldiers, O sire, slain<br>in battle, seeing the field of battle assume an aspect as awful as that<br>of the sporting ground of Rudra, observing the inglorious end obtained by<br>hundreds and thousands of kings, witnessing also the prowess of Partha<br>after the retreat of thy son with grief-stricken heart and when thy<br>troops, filled with anxiety and fallen into great distress, O Bharata,<br>were deliberating as to what they should next do, hearing also the loud<br>wails of the Kaurava warriors that were being crushed, and marking the<br>displayed and disordered tokens of great kings, the Kuru leader Kripa of<br>great energy, possessed of years and good conduct and filled with<br>compassion, and endued with eloquence, approached king Duryodhana, and<br>angrily said these words unto him, "O Duryodhana, listen, O Bharata, to<br>these words that I will say unto thee. Having heard them, O monarch, do<br>thou act according to them, O sinless one, if it pleases thee. There is<br>no path, O monarch, that is better than the duty of battle. Having<br>recourse to that path, Kshatriyas, O bull of the Kshatriya order, engage<br>in battle. He who lives in the observance of Kshatriya practices fights<br>with son, sire, brother, sister's son, and maternal uncle, and relatives,<br>and kinsmen. If he is slaughtered in battle, there is great merit in it.<br>Similarly, there is great sin in it if he flies from the field. It is for<br>this that the life of a person desirous of living by the adoption of<br>Kshatriya duties is exceedingly terrible. Unto thee, as regards this, I<br>will say a few beneficial words. After the fall of Bhishma and Drona and<br>the mighty car-warrior Karna, after the slaughter of Jayadratha and thy<br>brothers, O sinless one, and thy son Lakshmana, what is there now for us<br>to do? They upon whom we had rested all burdens of sovereignty we had<br>been enjoying, have all gone to regions of blessedness attainable by<br>persons conversant with Brahma, casting off their bodies. As regards<br>ourselves, deprived of those great car-warriors possessed of numerous<br>accomplishments, we shall have to pass our time in grief, having caused<br>numerous kings to perish. When all those heroes were alive, even then<br>Vibhatsu could not be vanquished. Having Krishna, for his eyes, that<br>mighty-armed hero is incapable of being defeated by the very gods. The<br>vast (Kaurava) host, approaching his Ape-bearing standard that is lofty<br>as an Indra's pole (set up in the season of spring) and that is effulgent<br>as Indra's bow, hath always trembled in fear. At the leonine roars of<br>Bhimasena and the blare of Panchajanya and the twang of Gandiva, our<br>heart will die away within us. Moving like flashes of lightning, and<br>blinding our eyes, Arjuna's Gandiva is seen to resemble a circle of fire.<br>Decked with pure gold, that formidable bow as it is shaken, looks<br>lightning's flash moving about on every side. Steeds white in hue and<br>possessed of great speed and endued with the splendour of the Moon or the<br>Kasa grass, and that run devouring the skies, are yoked unto his car.<br>Urged on by Krishna, like the masses of clouds driven by the wind, and<br>their limbs decked with gold, they bear Arjuna to battle. That foremost<br>of all persons conversant with arms, Arjuna, burned that great force of<br>thine like a swelling conflagration consuming dry grass in the forest in<br>the season of winter. Possessed of the splendour of Indra himself, while<br>penetrating into our ranks, we have seen Dhananjaya to look like an<br>elephant with four tusks. While agitating thy army and inspiring the<br>kings with fear, we have seen Dhananjaya to resemble an elephant<br>agitating a lake overgrown with lotuses. While terrifying all the<br>warriors with the twang of his bow, we have again seen the son of Pandu<br>to resemble a lion inspiring smaller animals with dread. Those two<br>foremost of bowmen in all the worlds, those two bulls among all persons<br>armed with the bow, the two Krishnas, clad in mail, are looking<br>exceedingly beautiful. Today is the seventeenth day of this awful battle,<br>O Bharata, of those that are being slaughtered in the midst of this<br>fight. The diverse divisions of thy army are broken and dispersed like<br>autumnal clouds dispersed by the wind. Savyasaci, O monarch, caused thy<br>army to tremble and reel like a tempest-tossed boat exposed on the bosom<br>of the ocean. Where was the Suta's son, where was Drona with all his<br>followers, where was I, where wert thou, where was Hridika's son, where<br>thy brother Duhshasana accompanied by his brothers (when Jayadratha was<br>slain)? Upon beholding Jayadratha and finding him within the range of his<br>arrows, Arjuna, putting forth his process upon all thy kinsmen and<br>brothers and allies and maternal uncles, and placing his feet upon their<br>heads, slew king Jayadratha in the very sight of all. What then is there<br>for us to do now? Who is there among thy troops now that would vanquish<br>the son of Pandu? That high-souled warrior possesses diverse kinds of<br>celestial weapons. The twang, again, of Gandiva robbeth us of our<br>energies. This army of thine that is now without a leader is like a night<br>without the Moon, or like a river that is dried up with all the trees on<br>its banks broken by elephants. The mighty-armed Arjuna of white steeds<br>will, at his pleasure, career amid this thy masterless host, like a<br>blazing conflagration amid a heap of grass. The impetuosity of those two,<br>Satyaki and Bhimasena, would split all the mountains or dry up all the<br>oceans. The words that Bhima spoke in the midst of the assembly have all<br>been nearly accomplished by him, O monarch. That which remains<br>unaccomplished will again be accomplished by him. While Karna was<br>battling before it, the army of the Pandavas, difficult to be defeated,<br>was vigorously protected by the wielder of Gandiva. You have done many<br>foul wrongs, without any cause, unto the righteous Pandavas. The fruits<br>of those acts have now come. For the sake of thy own objects thou hadst,<br>with great care, mustered together a large force. That vast force, as<br>also thyself, O bull of Bharata's race, have fallen into great danger.<br>Preserve thy own self now, for self is the refuge of everything. If the<br>refuge is broken, O sire, everything inhering thereto is scattered on<br>every side. He that is being weakened should seek peace by conciliation.<br>He that is growing should make war. This is the policy taught by<br>Brihaspati. We are now inferior to the sons of Pandu as regards the<br>strength of our army. Therefore, O lord, I think, peace with the Pandavas<br>is for our good. He that does not know what is for his good, or (knowing)<br>disregards what is for his good, is soon divested of his kingdom and<br>never obtains any good. If, by bowing unto king Yudhishthira sovereignty<br>may still remain to us, even that would be for our good, and not, O king,<br>to sustain through folly defeat (at the hands of the Pandavas).<br>Yudhishthira is compassionate. At the request of Vichitravirya's son and<br>of Govinda, he will allow you to continue as king. Whatever Hrishikesa<br>will say unto the victorious king Yudhishthira and Arjuna and Bhimasena,<br>all of them will, without doubt, obey. Krishna will not, I think, be able<br>to transgress the words of Dhritarashtra of Kuru's race, nor will the son<br>of Pandu be able to transgress those of Krishna. A cessation of<br>hostilities with the sons of Pritha is what I consider to be for thy<br>good. I do not say this unto thee from any mean motives nor for<br>protecting my life. I say, O king, that which I regard to be beneficial.<br>Thou wilt recollect these words when thou wilt be on the point of death<br>(if thou neglectest them now)." Advanced in years, Kripa the son of<br>Saradwat said these words weepingly. Breathing long and hot breaths, he<br>then gave way to sorrow and almost lost his senses.'"
