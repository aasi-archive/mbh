                            Vaishampayana said, "At the outset, O Janamejaya a fierce wordy encounter<br>took place between the two heroes. With respect to that, king<br>Dhritarashtra, filled with grief, said this, 'Oh, fie on man, who hath<br>such an end! My son, O sinless one, had been the lord of eleven chamus of<br>troops He had all the kings under his command and had enjoyed the<br>sovereignty of the whole earth! Alas, he that had been so, now a warrior<br>proceeding to battle, on foot, shouldering his mace! My poor son, who had<br>before been the protector of the universe, was now himself without<br>protection! Alas, he had, on that occasion, to proceed on foot,<br>shouldering his mace! What can it be but Destiny? Alas, O Sanjaya, great<br>was the grief that was felt by my son now!' Having uttered these words,<br>that ruler of men, afflicted with great woe, became silent.<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Deep-voiced like a cloud, Duryodhana then roared from joy<br>like a bull. Possessed of great energy, he challenged the son of Pritha<br>to battle. When the high-souled king of the Kurus thus summoned Bhima to<br>the encounter, diverse portents of an awful kind became noticeable.<br>Fierce winds began to blow with loud noises at intervals, and a shower of<br>dust fell. All the points of the compass became enveloped in a thick<br>gloom. Thunderbolts of loud peal fell on all sides, causing a great<br>confusion and making the very hair to stand on end. Hundreds of meteors<br>fell, bursting with a loud noise from the welkin. Rahu swallowed the Sun<br>most untimely, O monarch! The Earth with her forests and trees shook<br>greatly. Hot winds blew, bearing showers of hard pebbles along the<br>ground. The summits of mountains fell down on the earth's surface.<br>Animals of diverse forms were seen to run in all directions. Terrible and<br>fierce jackals, with blazing mouths, howled everywhere. Loud and terrific<br>reports were heard on every side, making the hair stand on end. The four<br>quarters seemed to be ablaze and many were the animals of ill omen that<br>became visible. The water in the wells on every side swelled up of their<br>own accord. Loud sounds came from every side, without, O king, visible<br>creatures to utter them. Beholding these and other portents, Vrikodara<br>said unto his eldest brother, king Yudhishthira the just, "This Suyodhana<br>of wicked soul is not competent to vanquish me in battle! I shall today<br>vomit that wrath which I have been cherishing for a long while in the<br>secret recesses of my heart, upon this ruler of the Kurus like Arjuna<br>throwing fire upon the forest of Khandava! Today, O son of Pandu, I shall<br>extract the dart that lies sticking to thy heart! Slaying with my mace<br>this sinful wretch of Kuru's race, I shall today place around thy neck<br>the garland of Fame! Slaying this wight of sinful deeds with my mace on<br>the field of battle, I shall today, with this very mace of mine, break<br>his body into a hundred fragments! He shall not have again to enter the<br>city called after the elephant. The setting of snakes at us while we were<br>asleep, the giving of poison to us while we ate, the casting of our body<br>into the water at Pramanakoti, the attempt to burn us at the house of<br>lac, the insult offered us at the assembly, the robbing us of all our<br>possessions, the whole year of our living in concealment, our exile into<br>the woods, O sinless one, of all these woes, O best of Bharata's race, I<br>shall today reach the end, O bull of Bharata's line! Slaying this wretch,<br>I shall, in one single day, pay off all the debts I owe him! Today, the<br>period of life of this wicked son of Dhritarashtra, of uncleansed soul,<br>hath reached its close, O chief of the Bharatas! After this day he shall<br>not again look at his father and mother! Today, O monarch, the happiness<br>of this wicked king of the Kurus hath come to an end! After this day, O<br>monarch, he shall not again cast his eyes on female beauty! Today this<br>disgrace of Santanu's line shall sleep on the bare Earth, abandoning his<br>life-breath, his prosperity, and his kingdom! Today king Dhritarashtra<br>also, hearing of the fall of his son, shall recollect all those evil acts<br>that were born of Shakuni's brain!" With these words, O tiger among<br>kings, Vrikodara of great energy, armed with mace, stood for fight, like<br>Shakra challenging the asura Vritra. Beholding Duryodhana also standing<br>with uplifted mace like mount Kailasa graced with its summit, Bhimasena,<br>filled with wrath, once more addressed him, saying, "Recall to thy mind<br>that evil act of thyself and king Dhritarashtra that occurred at<br>Varanavata! Remember Draupadi who was ill-treated, while in her season,<br>in the midst of the assembly! Remember the deprivation of the king<br>through dice by thyself and Subala's son! Remember that great woe<br>suffered by us, in consequence of thee, in the forest, as also in<br>Virata's city as if we had once more entered the womb! I shall avenge<br>myself of them all today! By good luck, O thou of wicked soul, I see thee<br>today! It is for thy sake that that foremost of car-warriors, the son of<br>Ganga, of great prowess, struck down by Yajnasena's son, sleepeth on a<br>bed of arrows! Drona also hath been slain, and Karna, and Shalya of great<br>prowess! Subala's son Shakuni, too, that root of these hostilities, hath<br>been slain! The wretched Pratikamin, who had seized Draupadi's tresses,<br>hath been slain! All thy brave brothers also, who fought with great<br>valour, have been slain! These and many other kings have been slain<br>through thy fault! Thee too I shall slay today with my mace! There is not<br>the slightest doubt in this." While Vrikodara, O monarch, was uttering<br>these words in a loud voice, thy fearless son of true prowess answered<br>him, saying, "What use of such elaborate bragging? Fight me, O Vrikodara!<br>O wretch of thy race, today I shall destroy thy desire of battle! Mean<br>vermin as thou art, know that Duryodhana is not capab le, like an<br>ordinary person, of being terrified by a person like thee! For a long<br>time have I cherished this desire! For a long time hath this wish been in<br>my heart! By good luck the gods have at last brought it about, a mace<br>encounter with thee! What use of long speeches and empty bragging, O<br>wicked-souled one! Accomplish these words of thine in acts. Do not tarry<br>at all!" Hearing these words of his, the Somakas and the other kings that<br>were present there all applauded them highly. Applauded by all,<br>Duryodhana's hair stood erect with joy and he firmly set his heart on<br>battle. The kings present once again cheered thy wrathful son with<br>clapping, like persons exciting an infuriated elephant to an encounter.<br>The high-souled Vrikodara, the son of Pandu, then, uplifting his mace,<br>rushed furiously at thy high-souled son. The elephants present there<br>trumpeted aloud and the steeds neighed repeatedly. The weapons of the<br>Pandavas who longed for victory blazed forth of their own accord.'"
