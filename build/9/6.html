                            "Sanjaya said, 'On that table land at the foot of Himavat, those<br>warriors, O monarch, delighting at the prospect of battle and assembled<br>together, passed the night. Indeed, Shalya and Chitrasena and the mighty<br>car-warrior Shakuni and Ashvatthama and Kripa and Kritavarma of the<br>Satwata race, and Sushena and Arishtasena and Dhritasena of great energy<br>and Jayatsena and all these kings passed the night there. After the<br>heroic Karna had been slain in battle, thy sons, inspired with fright by<br>the Pandavas desirous of victory, failed to obtain peace anywhere else<br>than on the mountains of Himavat. All of them then, O king, who were<br>resolved on battle, duly worshipped the king and said unto him, in the<br>presence of Shalya, these words, "It behoveth thee to fight with the<br>enemy, after having made some one the generalissimo of thy army,<br>protected by whom in battle we will vanquish our foes." Then Duryodhana,<br>without alighting from his car (proceeded towards) that foremost of<br>car-warriors, that hero conversant with all the rules of battle<br>(Ashvatthama), who resembled the Destroyer himself in battle. Possessed<br>of beautiful limbs, of head well covered, of a neck adorned with three<br>lines like those in a conch shell, of sweet speech, of eyes resembling<br>the petals of a full blown lotus, and of a face like that of the dignity<br>of Meru, resembling the bull of Mahadeva as regards neck, eyes, tread,<br>and voice, endued with arms that were large, massive, and well-joined,<br>having a chest that was broad and well-formed, equal unto Garuda or the<br>wind in speed and might, gifted with a splendour like that of the rays of<br>the Sun, rivalling Usanas himself in intelligence and the Moon in beauty<br>and form and charms of face, with a body that seemed to be made of a<br>number of golden lotuses, with well-made joints, of well-formed thighs<br>and waist and hips, of beautiful fingers, and beautiful nails, he seemed<br>to have been made by the Creator with care after collecting one after<br>another all the beautiful and good attributes of creation. Possessed of<br>every auspicious mark, and clever in every act, he was an ocean of<br>learning. Ever vanquishing his foes with great speed, he was incapable of<br>being forcibly vanquished by foes. He knew, in all its details, the<br>science of weapons consisting of four padas and ten angas. He knew also<br>the four Vedas with all their branches, and the Akhyanas as the fifth.<br>Possessed of great ascetic merit, Drona, himself not born of woman,<br>having worshipped the Three-eyed deity with great attention and austere<br>vows, begat him upon a wife not born of woman. Approaching that personage<br>of unrivalled feats, that one who is unrivalled in beauty on Earth, that<br>one who has mastered all branches of learning, that ocean of<br>accomplishments, that faultless Ashvatthama, thy son told him these<br>words, "Thou, O preceptor's son, art today our highest refuge. Tell us,<br>therefore, who is to be the generalissimo of my forces now, placing whom<br>at our head, all of us, united together, may vanquish the Pandavas?"<br><br>"'(Thus addressed), the son of Drona answered, "Let Shalya become the<br>leader of our army. In descent, in prowess, in energy, in fame, in beauty<br>of person, and in every other accomplishment, he is superior. Mindful of<br>the services rendered to him, he has taken up our side, having abandoned<br>the sons of his own sister. Owning a large force of his own, that<br>mighty-armed one is like a second (Kartikeya, the) celestial<br>generalissimo. Making that king the commander of our forces, O best of<br>monarchs, we will be able to gain victory, like the gods, after making<br>the unvanquished Skanda their commander." After Drona's son had said<br>these words, all the kings stood, surrounding Shalya, and cried victory<br>to him. Having made up their minds for battle, they felt great joy. Then<br>Duryodhana, alighting from his car, joined his hands and addressing<br>Shalya, that rival of Drona and Bhishma in battle, who was on his car,<br>said these words, "O thou that art devoted to friends, that time has now<br>come for thy friends when intelligent men examine persons in the guise of<br>friends as to whether they are true friends or otherwise. Brave as thou<br>art, be thou our generalissimo at the van of our army. When thou wilt<br>proceed to battle, the Pandavas, with their friends, will become<br>cheerless, and the Pancalas will be depressed."<br><br>"'Shalya answered, "I will, O king of the Kurus, accomplish that which<br>thou askest me to accomplish. Everything I have&#8212;my life breath, my<br>kingdom, my wealth&#8212;is at thy service."<br><br>"'Duryodhana said, "I solicit thee with offer of the leadership of my<br>army, O maternal uncle. O foremost of warriors, protect us incomparably,<br>even as Skanda protected the gods in battle. O foremost of kings, thyself<br>cause thy own self to be installed in the command as Pavaka's son<br>Kartikeya in the command of (the forces of) the celestials. O hero, slay<br>our foes in battle like Indra slaying the Danavas."'"
