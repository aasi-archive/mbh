                            "Sanjaya said, 'After that night had passed away, king Duryodhana then,<br>addressing all thy soldiers, said, "Arm, you mighty car-warriors!"<br>Hearing the command of the king, the warriors began to put on their<br>armour. Some began to yoke their steeds to their cars quickly, others ran<br>hither and thither. The elephants began to be equipped. The foot-soldiers<br>began to arm. Others, numbering thousands, began to spread carpets on the<br>terraces of cars. The noise of musical instruments, O monarch, arose<br>there, for enhancing the martial enthusiasm of the soldiers. Then all the<br>troops, placed in their proper posts, were seen, O Bharata, to stand,<br>clad in mail and resolved to make death their goal. Having made the ruler<br>of the Madras their leader, the great car-warriors of the Kauravas,<br>distributing their troops, stood in divisions. Then all thy warriors,<br>with Kripa and Kritavarma and Drona's son and Shalya and Subala's son and<br>the other kings that were yet alive, met thy son, and arrived at this<br>understanding, that none of them would individually and alone fight with<br>the Pandavas. And they said, "He amongst us that will fight, alone and<br>unsupported, with the Pandavas, or he that will abandon a comrade engaged<br>in fight, will be stained with the five grave sins and all the minor<br>sins." And they said, "All of us, united together, will fight with the<br>foe." Those great car-warriors, having made such an understanding with<br>one another placed the ruler of the Madras at their head and quickly<br>proceeded against their foes. Similarly, all the Pandavas, having arrayed<br>their troops in great battle, proceeded against the Kauravas, O king, for<br>fighting with them on every side. Soon, O chief of the Bharatas, that<br>host, whose noise resembled that of the agitated ocean, and which seemed<br>to be wonderful in consequence of its cars and elephants, presented the<br>aspect of the vast deep swelling with its surges.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'I have heard of the fall of Drona, of Bhishma and<br>of the son of Radha. Tell me now of the fall of Shalya and of my son.<br>How, indeed, O Sanjaya, was Shalya slain by king Yudhishthira the just?<br>And how was my son Duryodhana slain by Bhimasena of great might?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Hear, O king, with patience, of the destruction of human<br>bodies and the loss of elephants and steeds, as I describe (to thee) the<br>battle. The hope became strong, O king, in the breasts of thy sons that,<br>after Drona and Bhishma and the Suta's son had been overthrown, Shalya, O<br>sire, would slay all the Parthas in battle. Cherishing that hope in his<br>heart, and drawing comfort from it, O Bharata, thy son Duryodhana,<br>relying in battle upon that mighty car-warrior, the ruler of the Madras,<br>regarded himself as possessed of a protector. When after Karna's fall the<br>Parthas had uttered leonine roars, a great fear, O king, had possessed<br>the hearts of the Dhartarashtras. Assuring him duly, the valiant king of<br>the Madras, having formed, O monarch, a grand array whose arrangements<br>were auspicious in every respect, proceeded against the Parthas in<br>battle. And the valiant king of the Madras proceeded, shaking his<br>beautiful and exceedingly strong bow capable of imparting a great<br>velocity to the shafts sped from it. And that mighty car-warrior was<br>mounted upon the foremost of vehicles, having horses of the Sindhu breed<br>yoked unto it. Riding upon his car, his driver made the vehicle look<br>resplendent. Protected by that car, that hero, that brave crusher of foes<br>(Shalya), stood, O monarch, dispelling the fears of thy sons. The king of<br>the Madras, clad in mail, proceeded at the head of the array, accompanied<br>by the brave Madrakas and the invincible sons of Karna. On the left was<br>Kritavarma, surrounded by the Trigartas. On the right was Gautama (Kripa)<br>with the Sakas and the Yavanas. In the rear was Ashvatthama surrounded by<br>the Kambojas. In the centre was Duryodhana, protected by the foremost of<br>the Kuru warriors. Surrounded by a large force of cavalry and other<br>troops, Subala's son Shakuni, as also the mighty car-warrior Uluka,<br>proceeded with the others. The mighty bowmen amongst the Pandavas, those<br>chastisers of foes, dividing themselves, O monarch, into three bodies,<br>rushed against thy troops. Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi and the mighty<br>car-warrior Satyaki proceeded with great speed against the army of<br>Shalya. Then king Yudhishthira, accompanied by his troops, rushed against<br>Shalya alone, from desire of slaughtering him, O bull of Bharata's race.<br>Arjuna, that slayer of large bands of foes, rushed with great speed<br>against that great bowman Kritavarma and the Samsaptakas. Bhimasena and<br>the great car-warriors among the Somakas rushed, O monarch, against<br>Kripa, desirous of slaughtering their foes in battle. The two sons of<br>Madri, accompanied by their troops, proceeded against Shakuni and the<br>great car-warrior Uluka at the head of their forces. Similarly, thousands<br>upon thousands of warriors of thy army, armed with diverse weapons and<br>filled with rage, proceeded against the Pandavas in that battle.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'After the fall of the mighty bowmen Bhishma and<br>Drona and the great car-warrior Karna, and after both the Kurus and the<br>Pandavas had been reduced in numbers, and when, indeed, the Parthas,<br>possessed of great prowess, became once more angry in battle, what, O<br>Sanjaya, was the strength of each of the armies?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Hear, O king, how we and the enemy both stood for battle<br>on that occasion and what was then the strength of the two armies. 11,000<br>cars, O bull of Bharata's race, 10,700 elephants, and full 200,000<br>horses, and three millions of foot, composed the strength of thy army.<br>6,000 cars, 6,000 elephants, 10,000 horses, and one million of foot, O<br>Bharata, were all that composed the remnant of the Pandava force in the<br>battle. These, O bull of Bharata's race, encountered each other for<br>battle. Having distributed their forces in this way, O monarch,<br>ourselves, excited with wrath and inspired with desire of victory,<br>proceeded against the Pandavas, having placed ourselves under the command<br>of the ruler of the Madras. Similar, the brave Pandavas, those tigers<br>among men, desirous of victory, and the Pancalas possessed of great fame,<br>came to battle. Even thus, O monarch, all those tigers among men,<br>desirous of slaughtering their foes, encountered one another at dawn of<br>day, O lord. Then commenced a fierce and terrible battle between thy<br>troops and the enemy, the combatants being all engaged in striking and<br>slaughtering one another.'"
