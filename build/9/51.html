                            Vaishampayana said, "There, in that tirtha, O Bharata, where the Lord of<br>stars had in former days performed the rajasuya sacrifice, a great battle<br>was fought in which Taraka was the root of the evil. Bathing in that<br>tirtha and making many presents, the virtuous Bala of cleansed soul<br>proceeded to the tirtha of the muni named Sarasvata. There, during a<br>drought extending for twelve years, the sage Sarasvata, in former days,<br>taught the Vedas unto many foremost of brahmanas."<br><br>Janamejaya said, "Why did the sage Sarasvata, O thou of ascetic merit,<br>teach the Vedas unto the rishis during a twelve years' drought?"<br><br>Vaishampayana continued, "In days of yore, O monarch, there was an<br>intelligent sage of great ascetic merit. He was celebrated by the name of<br>Dadhica. Possessing a complete control over his senses, he led the life<br>of a brahmacari. In consequence of his excessive ascetic austerities<br>Shakra was afflicted with a great fear. The sage could not be turned<br>(away from his penance) by the offer of even diverse kinds of rewards. At<br>last the chastiser of Paka, for tempting the sage, despatched unto him<br>the exceedingly beautiful and celestial apsara, by name Alambusa. Thither<br>where on the banks of the Sarasvati the high-souled sage was engaged in<br>the act of gratifying the gods, the celestial damsel named above, O<br>monarch, made her appearance. Beholding that damsel of beautiful limbs,<br>the vital seed of that ascetic of cleansed soul came out. It fell into<br>the Sarasvati, and the latter held it with care. Indeed, O bull among<br>men, the River, beholding that seed, held it in her womb. In time the<br>seed developed into a foetus and the great river held it so that it might<br>be inspired with life as a child. When the time came, the foremost of<br>rivers brought forth that child and then went, O lord, taking it with<br>her, to that rishi.<br><br>Beholding that best of rishis in a conclave, Sarasvati, O monarch, while<br>making over the child, said these words, 'O regenerate rishi, this is thy<br>son whom I held through devotion for thee! That seed of thine which fell<br>at sight of the apsara Alambusa, had been held by me in my womb, O<br>regenerate rishi, through devotion for thee, well knowing that that<br>energy of thine would never suffer destruction! Given by me, accept this<br>faultless child of thy own!' Thus addressed by her, the rishi accepted<br>the child and felt great joy. Through affection, that foremost of<br>brahmanas then smelt the head of his son and held him in a close embrace,<br>O foremost one of Bharata's race, for some time. Gratified with the<br>River, the great ascetic Dadhica then gave a boon to her, saying, 'The<br>vishvadevas, the rishis, and all the tribes of the gandharvas and the<br>apsaras, will henceforth, O blessed one, derive great happiness when<br>oblations of thy water are presented unto them!'<br><br>Having said so unto that great river, the sage, gratified and filled with<br>joy, then praised her in these words. Listen to them duly, O king! 'Thou<br>hast taken thy rise, O highly blessed one, from the lake of Brahman in<br>days of old. All ascetics of rigid vows know thee, O foremost of rivers!<br>Always of agreeable features, thou hast done me great good! This thy<br>great child, O thou of the fairest complexion, will be known by the name<br>of Sarasvata! This thy son, capable of creating new worlds, will become<br>known after thy name! Indeed, that great ascetic will be known by the<br>name of Sarasvata! During a drought extending for twelve years, this<br>Sarasvata, O blessed one, will teach the Vedas unto many foremost of<br>brahmanas! O blessed Sarasvati, through my grace, thou shalt, O beautiful<br>one, always become the foremost of all sacred rivers!' Even thus was the<br>great River praised by the sage after the latter had granted her boons.<br>The River then, in great joy, went away, O bull of Bharata's race, taking<br>with her that child.<br><br>Meanwhile, on the occasion of a war between the gods and the danavas,<br>Shakra wandered through the three worlds in search of weapons. The great<br>god, however, failed to find such weapons as were fit to slay the foes of<br>the celestials. Shakra then said unto the gods. 'The great asuras are<br>incapable of being dealt with by me! Indeed, without the bones of<br>Dadhica, our foes could not be slain! Ye best of celestials, repair,<br>therefore, to that foremost of rishis and solicit him, saying, "Grant us,<br>O Dadhica, thy bones! With them we will slay our foes!"<br><br>Besought by them for his bones, that foremost of rishis, O chief of<br>Kuru's race, unhesitatingly gave up his life. Having done what was<br>agreeable to the gods, the sage obtained many regions of inexhaustible<br>merit. With his bones, meanwhile, Shakra joyfully caused to be made many<br>kinds of weapons, such as thunderbolts, discs, heavy maces, and many<br>kinds of clubs and bludgeons. Equal unto the Creator himself, Dadhica,<br>had been begotten by the great rishi Bhrigu, the son of the Lord of all<br>creatures, with the aid of his austere penances. Of stout limbs and<br>possessed of great energy, Dadhica had been made the strongest of<br>creatures in the world. The puissant Dadhica, celebrated for his glory,<br>became tall like the king of mountains. The chastiser of Paka had always<br>been anxious on account of his energy. With the thunderbolt born of<br>brahma energy, and inspired with mantras, O Bharata, Indra made a loud<br>noise when he hurled it, and slew nine and ninety heroes among the<br>daityas. After a long and dreadful time had elapsed since then, a<br>drought, O king, occurred that extended for twelve years. During that<br>drought extending for twelve years, the great rishis, for the sake of<br>sustenance, fled away, O monarch, on all sides.<br><br>Beholding them scattered in all directions, the sage Sarasvata also set<br>his heart on flight. The river Sarasvati then said unto him, 'Thou needst<br>not, O son, depart hence, for I will always supply thee with food even<br>here by giving thee large fishes! Stay thou, therefore, even here!' Thus<br>addressed (by the river), the sage continued to live there and offer<br>oblations of food unto the rishis and the gods. He got also his daily<br>food and thus continued to support both himself and the gods.<br><br>After that twelve year's drought had passed away, the great rishis<br>solicited one another for lectures on the Vedas. While wandering with<br>famished stomachs, the rishis had lost the knowledge of the Vedas. There<br>was, indeed, not one amongst them that could understand the scriptures.<br>It chanced that someone amongst them encountered Sarasvata, that foremost<br>of rishis, while the latter was reading the Vedas with concentrated<br>attention. Coming back to the conclave of rishis, he spoke to them of<br>Sarasvata of unrivalled splendour and god-like mien engaged in reading<br>the Vedas in a solitary forest. Then all the great rishis came to that<br>spot, and jointly spoke unto Sarasvata, that best of ascetics, these<br>words, 'Teach us, O sage!' Unto them the ascetic replied, saying, 'Become<br>ye my disciples duly!' The conclave of ascetics answered, 'O son, thou<br>art too young in years!' Thereupon he answered the ascetics, 'I must act<br>in such a way that my religious merit may not suffer a diminution! He<br>that teaches improperly, and he that learns improperly, are both lost in<br>no time and come to hate each other! It is not upon years, or<br>decrepitude, or wealth, or the number of kinsmen, that rishis found their<br>claim to merit! He amongst us is great who is capable of reading and<br>understanding the Vedas!'<br><br>Hearing these words of his, those munis duly became his disciples and<br>obtaining from him their Vedas, once more began to praise their rites.<br>60,000 munis became disciples of the regenerate rishi Sarasvata for the<br>sake of acquiring their Vedas from him. Owning obedience to that<br>agreeable rishi, though a boy, the munis each brought a handful of grass<br>and offered it to him for his seat. The mighty son of Rohini, and elder<br>brother of Keshava, having given away wealth in that tirtha, then<br>joyfully proceeded to another place where lived (in days of yore) an old<br>lady without having passed through the ceremony of marriage."
