                            Janamejaya said, "Why, O regenerate one, did that maiden betake herself<br>to ascetic penances, in days of old? For what reason did she practise<br>penances, and what was her vow? Unrivalled and fraught with mystery is<br>the discourse that I have already heard from thee! Tell me (now) all the<br>particulars in detail regarding how that maid engaged herself in<br>penances."<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "There was a rishi of abundant energy and great fame,<br>named Kuni-Garga. That foremost of ascetics, having practised the<br>austerest of penances, O king, created a fair-browed daughter by a fiat<br>of his will. Beholding her, the celebrated ascetic Kuni-Garga became<br>filled with joy. He abandoned his body, O king, and then went to heaven.<br>That faultless and amiable and fair-browed maiden, meanwhile, of eyes<br>like lotus petals continued to practise severe and very rigid penances.<br>She worshipped the pitris and the gods with fasts. In the practice of<br>such severe penances a long period elapsed. Though her sire had been for<br>giving her away to a husband, she yet did not wish for marriage, for she<br>did not see a husband that could be worthy of her.<br><br>Continuing to emaciate her body with austere penances, she devoted<br>herself to the worship of the pitris and the gods in that solitary<br>forest. Although engaged in such toil, O monarch, and although she<br>emaciated herself by age and austerities, yet she regarded herself happy.<br>At last when she (became very old so that she) could no longer move even<br>a single step without being aided by somebody, she set her heart upon<br>departing for the other world.<br><br>Beholding her about to cast off her body, Narada said unto her, 'O<br>sinless one, thou hast no regions of blessedness to obtain in consequence<br>of thy not having cleansed thyself by rite of marriage! O thou of great<br>vows, we have heard this in heaven! Great hath been thy ascetic<br>austerities, but thou hast no claim to regions of blessedness!'<br><br>Hearing these words of Narada, the old lady went to a concourse of rishis<br>and said, 'I shall give him half my penances who will accept my hand in<br>marriage!' After she had said those words, Galava's son, a rishi, known<br>by the name of Sringavat, accepted her hand, having proposed this compact<br>to her, 'With this compact, O beautiful lady, I shall accept thy hand,<br>that thou shalt live with me for only one night!' Having agreed to that<br>compact, she gave him her hand.<br><br>Indeed, Galava's son, according to the ordinances laid down and having<br>duly poured libations on the fire, accepted her hand and married her. On<br>that night, she became a young lady of the fairest complexion, robed in<br>celestial attire and decked in celestial ornaments and garlands and<br>smeared with celestial unguents and perfumes. Beholding her blazing with<br>beauty, Galava's son became very happy and passed one night in her<br>company.<br><br>At morn she said unto him, 'The compact, O brahmana, I had made with<br>thee, hath been fulfilled, O foremost of ascetics! Blessed be thou, I<br>shall now leave thee!' After obtaining his permission, she once more<br>said, 'He that will, with rapt attention, pass one night in this tirtha<br>after having gratified the denizens of heaven with oblations of water,<br>shall obtain that merit which is his who observes the vow of brahmacarya<br>for eight and fifty years!' Having said these words, that chaste lady<br>departed for heaven.<br><br>The Rishi, her lord, became very cheerless, by dwelling upon the memory<br>of her beauty. In consequence of the compact he had made, he accepted<br>with difficulty half her penances. Casting off his body he soon followed<br>her, moved by sorrow, O chief of Bharata's race, and forced to it by her<br>beauty.<br><br>Even this is the glorious history of the old maid that I have told thee!<br>Even this is the account of her brahmacarya and her auspicious departure<br>for heaven. While there Baladeva heard of the slaughter of Shalya. Having<br>made presents unto the brahmanas there, he gave way to grief, O scorcher<br>of his foes, for Shalya who had been slain by the Pandavas in battle.<br>Then he of Madhu's race, having come out of the environs of<br>Samantapanchaka, enquired of the rishis about the results of the battle<br>at Kurukshetra. Asked by that lion of Yadu's race about the results of<br>the battle at Kurukshetra, those high-souled ones told him everything as<br>it had happened."
