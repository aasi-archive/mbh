                            "Sanjaya said, 'After those three car-warriors had left that spot, the<br>Pandavas arrived at that lake within which Duryodhana was resting<br>himself. Having reached the banks of the Dvaipayana lake, O chief of<br>Kuru's race, they beheld that receptacle of waters enchanted by thy son.<br>Then Yudhishthira, addressing Vasudeva, said, "Behold, the son of<br>Dhritarashtra hath applied his power of illusion to these waters! Having<br>enchanted the waters, he lieth within them. He can have now no fear (of<br>injury) from man! Having invoked a celestial illusion, he is now within<br>the waters! By an act of deception, that wight conversant with every<br>deception hath sought this refuge! He shall not, however, escape me with<br>life! Even if the wielder of the thunderbolt himself aid him in battle,<br>people, O Madhava, shall yet behold him slain today!'<br><br>"'Vasudeva said, "With thy own powers of illusion, O Bharata, destroy<br>this illusion of Duryodhana who is an adept in it! One conversant with<br>illusion should be slain with illusion! This is the truth, O<br>Yudhishthira! With acts and means and applying thy power of illusion to<br>these waters, slay, O chief of the Bharatas, this Suyodhana, who is the<br>very soul of illusion! With acts and means Indra himself slew the Daityas<br>and the Danavas! Vali himself was bound by that high-souled one<br>(Upendra), with the aid of many acts and means! The great Asura<br>Hiranyaksha, as also that other one, Hiranyakasipu, was slain by the aid<br>of many acts and means. Without doubt, O king, Vritra also was slain by<br>the aid of acts! Similarly was the Rakshasa Ravana of Pulastya's race,<br>with his relatives and followers, slain by Rama! Relying upon acts and<br>contrivances, do thou also display thy powers! Those two ancient Daityas,<br>Taraka and Viprachitti of great energy, were in ancient times, O king,<br>slain by the aid of acts and means! Similarly, Vatapi and Ilwala, and<br>Trisiras, O lord, and the Asuras Sunda and Upasunda, were all slain by<br>the aid of means! Indra himself enjoys heaven by the aid of acts and<br>means! Acts are very efficacious, O king, and nothing else so, O<br>Yudhishthira! Daityas and Danavas and Rakshasas and kings had been slain<br>by the aid of acts and means. Do thou take therefore, the help of act!"'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed by Vasudeva, Pandu's son of rigid<br>vows, smiling the while, addressed, O monarch, thy son of great might,<br>who, O Bharata, was then within the waters of that lake, saying, "Why, O<br>Suyodhana, hast thou entered these waters, after having caused all the<br>Kshatriyas to perish and after having, O king, caused thy own race to be<br>annihilated? Why hast thou entered into this lake today, wishing to save<br>thy own life? Arise, O king, and fight us, O Suyodhana! Where, O foremost<br>of men, hath that pride and that sense of honour which thou hadst now<br>gone, since, O king, thou hast enchanted these waters and art now lying<br>within them? All men speak of thee in assemblies as a hero. All that,<br>however, is entirely untrue, I think, since thou art now concealed within<br>these waters! Arise, O king, and fight, for thou art a Kshatriya born of<br>a noble race! Thou art Kauraveya in particular! Remember thy birth! How<br>canst thou boast of thy birth in Kuru's race when thou concealest thyself<br>within the depths of this lake, having fled away from battle in fear?<br>This is not the eternal duty of a Kshatriya, staying away from battle!<br>Flight from battle, O king, is not the practice of those that are<br>honourable, nor does it lead to heaven! How is it that without having<br>attained to the end of this war, inspired though thou wert with the<br>desire of victory, thou stayest now within this lake, after having caused<br>and witnessed the slaughter of thy sons and brothers and sires and<br>relatives and friends and maternal uncles and kinsmen? Ever boastful of<br>thy courage, thou art, however, not a hero! Falsely dost thou describe<br>thyself, O Bharata, when thou sayst in the hearing of all men that thou<br>art a hero, O thou of wicked understanding! They that are heroes never<br>fly away at sight of foes! Or, tell us, O hero, about (the nature of)<br>that courage in consequence of which thou hast fled from battle! Arise, O<br>prince, and fight, casting off thy fears! Having caused all thy troops<br>and thy brothers to be slain, O Suyodhana, thou shouldst not, if thou art<br>inspired with righteous motives, think now of saving thy life! One like<br>thee, O Suyodhana, that has adopted Kshatriya duties, should not act in<br>this way! Relying upon Karna, as also upon Shakuni the son of Subala,<br>thou hadst regarded thyself immortal and hadst, from folly, failed to<br>understand thy own self! Having perpetrated such grievous sin, fight now,<br>O Bharata! How dost that flight from battle recommend itself to one like<br>thee? Surely, thou forgettest thyself! Where is that manliness of thine,<br>O sire, and where, O Suyodhana, is that pride cherished by thee! Where<br>hath that prowess of thine now gone, and where also that swelling and<br>great energy which thou hadst? Where is that accomplishment of thine in<br>weapons? Why dost thou lie within this lake now? Arise, O Bharata, and<br>fight, observing the duties of a Kshatriya! Either rule the wide earth<br>after vanquishing us, or sleep, O Bharata, on the bare ground, slain by<br>us! Even this is thy highest duty, as laid down by the illustrious<br>Creator himself! Act as it has been laid down truly in the scriptures,<br>and be a king, O great car-warrior!"'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed, O monarch, by the intelligent son of<br>Dharma, thy son answered him from within the waters in these words.<br><br>"'Duryodhana said, "It is not at all a matter of surprise, O king, that<br>fear should enter the hearts of living creatures. As regards myself,<br>however, O Bharata, I have not fled from the field of battle actuated by<br>the fear of life! My car was destroyed, my quivers were gone, and my<br>Parshni drivers were killed! I was alone, without a single follower to<br>stand by me in battle! It was for this that I desired a little rest! It<br>was not for the sake of saving my life, it was not from fear, it was not<br>from grief, O king, that I entered these waters! It was only in<br>consequence of fatigue that I did so! Do thou, O son of Kunti, rest a<br>while with those that follow thee! Rising from this lake I will certainly<br>fight all of you in battle!"<br><br>"'Yudhishthira said, 'All of us have rested sufficiently. For a long<br>while we were engaged in a search after thee! Rise then, even now, O<br>Suyodhana, and give us battle! Either slaying the Parthas in battle make<br>this kingdom that swelleth with prosperity thy own, or slain by us in<br>battle, proceed to those regions that are reserved for heroes!"<br><br>"'Duryodhana said, "They amongst the Kurus, O son of Kurus' race, for<br>whose sake I desired sovereignty, that is, those brothers of mine, O<br>king, all lie dead on the field! I do not, again, like to enjoy any<br>longer the earth that is now shorn of wealth and reft of superior<br>Kshatriyas, and that hath, therefore, become like a widowed lady! I,<br>however, still hope to vanquish thee, O Yudhishthira, after curbing the<br>pride, O bull of Bharata's race, of the Pancalas and the Pandus! There<br>is, however, no longer any need for battle when Drona and Karna have been<br>quieted and when our grandsire Bhishma hath been slain! This shorn earth,<br>O king, now exists for thee! What king is there that would like to rule a<br>kingdom divested of friends and allies? Having caused friends such as I<br>had to be slain and even sons and brothers and sires, and seeing my<br>kingdom wrested by you, who is there like myself that would like to live?<br>Clad in deer-skins I would retire into the woods! I have no desire for<br>kingdom, deprived as I am of friends and allies, O Bharata! Reft almost<br>entirely of friends and allies, of heroes and elephants, this earth<br>exists for thee, O king! Do thou enjoy her now cheerfully! As for myself,<br>clad in deerskins, I shall go to the woods! Friendless as I am, I have no<br>desire, O lord, for even life! Go, O monarch, and rule the earth<br>destitute of lords, without warriors, reft of wealth, and without<br>citadels, as thou choosest!"'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing these words of poignant grief the<br>illustrious Yudhishthira addressed thy son Duryodhana who was still<br>within those waters, saying, "Do not utter such ravings of sorrow, O<br>sire, from within the waters! I do not, like Shakuni, feel any compassion<br>for thee, O king, for such words as these! Thou mayest now, O Suyodhana,<br>be willing to make a gift of the earth to me. I, however, do not wish to<br>rule the earth thus given by thee! I cannot sinfully accept this earth<br>from thee! Acceptance of a gift, O king, is not the duty laid down for a<br>Kshatriya! I do not, therefore, wish to have the wide earth thus given<br>away by thee! I shall, on the other hand, enjoy the earth after<br>vanquishing thee in battle! Thou art now the lord of the earth! Why then<br>dost thou desire to make a gift of that over which thou hast no dominion?<br>Why, O king, didst thou not then give us the earth when we, observant of<br>the rules of righteousness and desirous of the welfare of our race, had<br>begged thee for our portion? Having first refused the request of the<br>mighty Krishna, why dost thou now desire to give away the earth? What is<br>this folly of thine? What king is there, who, assailed by foes, would<br>wish to give away his kingdom? O son of Kuru's race, today thou art not<br>competent to give away the earth! Why then dost thou wish to make a gift<br>of that over which thou hast no power? Vanquishing me in battle, rule<br>thou this earth! Thou didst not formerly agree to give me even that much<br>of the earth which would be covered by the point of a needle! How then, O<br>monarch, dost thou make me a gift of the whole earth? How is it that<br>thou, who couldst not formerly abandon even that much of land which the<br>point of a needle would cover, now wishest to abandon the whole earth?<br>What fool is there that would, after having obtained such prosperity and<br>ruled the entire earth, think of making a gift of that earth to his<br>enemies? Stupefied by folly, thou seest not the impropriety of this!<br>Although thou desirest to give away the earth, thou shalt not yet escape<br>me with life! Either rule the earth after having vanquished us, or go to<br>regions of blessedness after being slain by us! If both of us, that is,<br>thyself and myself, be alive, then all creatures will remain in doubt<br>about to whom the victory belongs. Thy life, O thou of limited foresight,<br>now depends upon me! If I like, I can suffer thee to live, but thou art<br>not capable of protecting thy own life! Thou hadst at one time especially<br>endeavoured to burn us to death and to take our lives by means of snakes<br>and other kinds of poison and by drowning us! We were also wronged by<br>thee, O king, by the deprivation of our kingdom, by the cruel words<br>spoken by thee, and by thy maltreatment of Draupadi! For these reasons, O<br>wretch, thy life must be taken! Rise, rise, and fight us! That will<br>benefit thee!"'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'In this strain, O king, those heroes, the Pandavas,<br>flushed with victory, repeatedly spoke there (rebuking and mocking<br>Duryodhana).'"
