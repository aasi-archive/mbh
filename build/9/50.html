                            Vaishampayana said, "In that tirtha lived in days of yore a Rishi of<br>virtuous soul, named Asita-Devala, observant of the duties of<br>Domesticity. Devoted to virtue, he led a life of purity and<br>self-restraint. Possessed of great ascetic merit, he was compassionate<br>unto all creatures and never injured anyone. In word, deed, and thought,<br>he maintained an equal behaviour towards all creatures. Without wrath, O<br>monarch, censure and praise were equal to him. Of equal attitude towards<br>the agreeable and the disagreeable, he was, like Yama himself, thoroughly<br>impartial. The great ascetic looked with an equal eye upon gold and a<br>heap of pebbles. He daily worshipped the gods and guests, and Brahmanas<br>(that came to him). Ever devoted to righteousness, he always practised<br>the vow of brahmacarya. Once upon a time, an intelligent ascetic, O<br>monarch, of the name of Jaigishavya, devoted to Yoga and rapt in<br>meditation and leading the life of a mendicant, came to Devala's asylum.<br>Possessed of great splendour, that great ascetic, ever devoted to Yoga, O<br>monarch, while residing in Devala's asylum, became crowned with ascetic<br>success. Indeed, while the great Muni Jaigishavya resided there, Devala<br>kept his eyes on him, never neglecting him at any time. Thus, O monarch,<br>a long time was passed by the two in days of yore. On one occasion,<br>Devala lost sight of Jaigishavya, that foremost of ascetics. At the hour,<br>however, of dinner, O Janamejaya, the intelligent and righteous ascetic,<br>leading a life of mendicancy, approached Devala for soliciting alms.<br>Beholding that great ascetic re-appear in the guise of a mendicant,<br>Devala showed him great honour and expressed much gratification. And<br>Devala worshipped his guest, O Bharata, according to the measure of his<br>abilities, after the rites laid down by the Rishis and with great<br>attention for many years. One day, however, O king, in the sight of that<br>great Muni, a deep anxiety perturbed the heart of the highsouled Devala.<br>The latter thought within himself, 'Many years have I passed in<br>worshipping this ascetic. This idle mendicant, however, hath not yet<br>spoken to me a single word!' Having thought of this, the blessed Devala<br>proceeded to the shores of the ocean, journeying through the welkin and<br>bearing his earthen jug with him. Arrived at the coast of the Ocean, that<br>lord of rivers, O Bharata, the righteous-souled Devala saw Jaigishavya<br>arrived there before him. The lord Asita, at this sight, became filled<br>with wonder and thought within himself, 'How could the mendicant come to<br>the ocean and perform his ablutions even before my arrival?' Thus thought<br>the great Rishi Asita. Duly performing his ablutions there and purifying<br>himself thereby, he then began to silently recite the sacred mantras.<br>Having finished his ablutions and silent prayers, the blessed Devala<br>returned to his asylum, O Janamejaya, bearing with him his earthen vessel<br>filled with water. As the ascetic, however, entered his own asylum, he<br>saw Jaigishavya seated there. The great ascetic Jaigishavya never spoke a<br>word to Devala, but lived in the latter's asylum as if he were a piece of<br>wood. Having beheld that ascetic, who was an ocean of austerities,<br>plunged in the waters of the sea (before his own arrival there), Asita<br>now saw him returned to his hermitage before his own return. Witnessing<br>this power, derived through Yoga, of Jaigishavya's penances, Asita<br>Devala, O king, endued with great intelligence, began to reflect upon the<br>matter. Indeed that best of ascetics, O monarch, wondered much, saying,<br>'How could this one be seen in the ocean and again in my hermitage?'<br>While absorbed in such thoughts, the ascetic Devala, conversant with<br>mantras, then soared aloft, O monarch, from his hermitage into the sky,<br>for ascertaining who Jaigishavya, wedded to a life of mendicancy, really<br>was. Devala saw crowds of sky-ranging Siddhas rapt in meditation, and he<br>saw Jaigishavya reverentially worshipped by those Siddhas. Firm in the<br>observance of his vows and persevering (in his efforts), Devala became<br>filled with wrath at the sight. He then saw Jaigishavya set out for<br>heaven. He next beheld him proceed to the region of the Pitris. Devala<br>saw him then proceed to the region of Yama. From Yama's region the great<br>ascetic Jaigishavya was then seen to soar aloft and proceed to the abode<br>of Soma. He was then seen to proceed to the blessed regions (one after<br>another) of the performers of certain rigid sacrifices. Thence he<br>proceeded to the regions of the Agnihotris and thence to the region of<br>those ascetics that perform the Darsa and the Paurnamasa sacrifices. The<br>intelligent Devala then saw him proceed from those regions of persons<br>performing sacrifices by killing animals to that pure region which is<br>worshipped by the very gods. Devala next saw the mendicant proceed to the<br>place of those ascetics that perform the sacrifice called Chaturmasya and<br>diverse others of the same kind. Thence he proceeded to the region<br>belonging to the performers of the Agnishtoma sacrifice. Devala then saw<br>his guest repair to the place of those ascetics that perform the<br>sacrifice called Agnishutta. Indeed, Devala next saw him in the regions<br>of those highly wise men that perform the foremost of sacrifices,<br>Vajapeya, and that other sacrifice in which a profusion of gold is<br>necessary. Then he saw Jaigishavya in the region of those that perform<br>the Rajasuya and the Pundarika. He then saw him in the regions of those<br>foremost of men that perform the horse-sacrifice and the sacrifice in<br>which human beings are slaughtered. Indeed, Devala saw Jaigishavya in the<br>regions also of those that perform the sacrifice called Sautramani and<br>that other in which the flesh, so difficult to procure, of all living<br>animals, is required. Jaigishavya was then seen in the regions of those<br>that perform the sacrifice called Dadasaha and diverse others of similar<br>character. Asita next saw his guest sojourning in the region of<br>Mitravaruna and then in that of the Adityas. Asita then saw his guest<br>pass through the regions of the Rudras, the Vasus and Brihaspati. Having<br>soared next into the blessed region called Goloka, Jaigishavya was next<br>seen to pass into these of the Brahmasatris. Having by his energy passed<br>through three other regions, he was seen to proceed to those regions that<br>are reserved for women that are chaste and devoted to their husbands.<br>Asita, however, at this point, O chastiser of foes, lost sight of<br>Jaigishavya, that foremost of ascetics, who, rapt in yoga, vanished from<br>his sight. The highly blessed Devala then reflected upon the power of<br>Jaigishavya and the excellence of his vows as also upon the unrivalled<br>success of his yoga. Then the self-restrained Asita, with joined hands<br>and in a reverential spirit, enquired of those foremost of Siddhas in the<br>regions of the Brahmasatris, saying, 'I do not see Jaigishavya! Tell me<br>where that ascetic of great energy is. I desire to hear this, for great<br>is my curiosity.'<br><br>"The Siddhis said, 'Listen, O Devala of rigid vows, as we speak to thee<br>the truth. Jaigishavya hath gone to the eternal region of Brahman.'"<br><br>Vaishampayana continued, "Hearing these words of those Siddhas residing<br>in the regions of the Brahmasatris, Asita endeavoured to soar aloft but<br>he soon fell down. The Siddhas then, once more addressing Devala, said<br>unto him, 'Thou, O Devala, art not competent to proceed thither, to the<br>abode of Brahman, whither Jaigishavya hath gone!'"<br><br>Vaishampayana continued, "Hearing those words of the Siddhas, Devala came<br>down, descending from one region to another in due order. Indeed, he<br>repaired to his own sacred asylum very quickly, like a winged insect. As<br>soon as he entered his abode he beheld Jaigishavya seated there. Then<br>Devala, beholding the power derived through Yoga of Jaigishavya's<br>penances, reflected upon it with his righteous understanding and<br>approaching that great ascetic, O king, with humility, addressed the<br>high-souled Jaigishavya, saying, 'I desire, O adorable one, to adopt the<br>religion of Moksha (Emancipation)! Hearing these words of his,<br>Jaigishavya gave him lessons. And he also taught him the ordinances of<br>Yoga and the supreme and eternal duties and their reverse. The great<br>ascetic, seeing him firmly resolved, performed all the acts (for his<br>admission into that religion) according to the rites ordained for that<br>end. Then all creatures, with the Pitris, beholding Devala resolved to<br>adopt the religion of Moksha, began to weep, saying, 'Alas, who will<br>henceforth give us food!' Hearing these lamentations of all creatures<br>that resounded through the ten points, Devala set his heart upon<br>renouncing the religion of Moksha. Then all kinds of sacred fruits and<br>roots, O Bharata, and flowers and deciduous herbs, in thousands, began to<br>weep, saying, 'The wicked-hearted and mean Devala will, without doubt,<br>once more pluck and cut us! Alas, having once assured all creatures of<br>his perfect harmlessness, he sees not the wrong that he meditates to do!'<br>At this, that best of ascetics began to reflect with the aid of his<br>understanding, saying, 'Which amongst these two, the religion of Moksha<br>or that of Domesticity, will be the better for me? Reflecting upon this,<br>Devala, O best of kings, abandoned the religion of Domesticity and<br>adopted that of Moksha. Having indulged in those reflections, Devala, in<br>consequence of that resolve obtained the highest success, O Bharata, and<br>the highest Yoga. The celestials then, headed by Brihaspati, applauded<br>Jaigishavya and the penances of that ascetic. Then that foremost of<br>ascetics, Narada, addressing the gods, said, 'There is no ascetic penance<br>in Jaigishavya since he filled Asita with wonder!' The denizens of heaven<br>then, addressing Narada who said such frightful words, said, 'Do not say<br>so about the great ascetic Jaigishavya! There is no one superior or even<br>equal to this high-souled one in force of energy and penance and Yoga!'<br>Even such was the power of Jaigishavya as also of Asita. This is the<br>place of those two, and this the tirtha of those two high-souled persons.<br>Bathing there and giving away wealth unto the Brahmanas, the high-souled<br>wielder of the plough, of noble deeds, earned great merit and then<br>proceeded to the tirtha of Soma."
