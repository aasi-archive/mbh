                            Vaishampayana said, "Then Valadeva, O king, proceeded to Vinasana where<br>the Sarasvati hath become invisible in consequence of her contempt for<br>Sudras and Abhiras. And since the Sarasvati, in consequence of such<br>contempt, is lost at that spot, the Rishis, for that reason, O chief of<br>the Bharatas, always name the place as Vinasana. Having bathed in that<br>tirtha of the Sarasvati, the mighty Baladeva then proceeded to Subhumika,<br>situated on the excellent bank of the same river. There many<br>fair-complexioned Apsaras, of beautiful faces, are always engaged in<br>sports of a pure character without any intermission. The gods and the<br>Gandharvas, every month, O ruler of men, repair to that sacred tirtha<br>which is the resort of Brahman himself. The Gandharvas and diverse tribes<br>of Apsaras are to be seen there, O king, assembled together and passing<br>the time as happily as they like. There the gods and the Pitris sport in<br>joy, with sacred and auspicious flowers repeatedly rained over them, and<br>all the creepers also were adorned with flowery loads. And because, O<br>king, that spot is the beautiful sporting ground of those Apsaras,<br>therefore is that tirtha on the excellent bank of the Sarasvati called<br>Subhumika. Baladeva of Madhu's race, having bathed in that tirtha and<br>given away much wealth unto the Brahmanas, heard the sound of those<br>celestial songs and musical instruments. He also saw there many shadows<br>of gods, Gandharvas, and Rakshasas. The son of Rohini then proceeded to<br>the tirtha of the Gandharvas. There many Gandharvas headed by Viswavasu<br>and possessed of ascetic merit, pass their time in dance and song of the<br>most charming kind. Giving away diverse kinds of wealth unto the<br>Brahmanas, as also goats and sheep and kine and mules and camels and gold<br>and silver, and feeding many Brahmanas and gratifying them with many<br>costly gifts that were desired by them. Baladeva of Madhu's race<br>proceeded thence, accompanied by many Brahmanas and eulogised by them.<br>Leaving that tirtha resorted to by Gandharvas, that mighty-armed<br>chastiser of foes, having but one earring, then proceeded to the famous<br>tirtha called Gargasrota. There, in that sacred tirtha of the Sarasvati,<br>the illustrious Garga of venerable years and soul cleansed by ascetic<br>penances, O Janamejaya, had acquired a knowledge of Time and its course,<br>of the deviations of luminous bodies (in the firmament), and of all<br>auspicious and inauspicious portents. That tirtha, for this reason, came<br>to be called after his name as Gargasrota. There, O king, highly blessed<br>Rishis of excellent vows always waited upon Garga, O lord, for obtaining<br>a knowledge of Time. Smeared with white sandal-paste, O king, Baladeva,<br>repairing to that tirtha, duly gave away wealth unto many ascetics of<br>cleansed souls. Having given also many kinds of costly viands unto the<br>Brahmanas, that illustrious one attired in blue robes then proceeded to<br>the tirtha called Sankha. There, on the bank of the Sarasvati, that<br>mighty hero having the palmyra on his banner beheld a gigantic tree,<br>called Mohasankha, tall as Meru, looking like the White-mountain, and<br>resorted to by Rishis. There dwell Yakshas, and Vidyadharas, and<br>Rakshasas of immeasurable energy and Pisachas of immeasurable might, and<br>Siddhas, numbering thousands. All of them, abandoning other kinds of<br>food, observe vows and regulations, and take at due seasons the fruits of<br>that lord of the forest for their sustenance and wander in separate<br>bands, unseen by men, O foremost of human beings! That monarch of the<br>forest, O king, is known for this throughout the world! That tree is the<br>cause of this celebrated and sacred tirtha on the Sarasvati. Having given<br>away in that tirtha many milch cows, and vessels of copper and iron, and<br>diverse kinds of other vessels, that tiger of Yadu's race, Baladeva,<br>having the plough for his weapon, worshipped the Brahmanas and was<br>worshipped by them in return. He then, O king, proceeded to the Dwaita<br>lake. Arrived there, Vala saw diverse kinds of ascetics in diverse kinds<br>of attire. Bathing in its waters, he worshipped the Brahmanas. Having<br>given away unto the Brahmanas diverse articles of enjoyment in profusion,<br>Baladeva then, O king, proceeded along the southern bank of the<br>Sarasvati. The mighty-armed and illustrious Rama of virtuous soul and<br>unfading glory then proceeded to the tirtha called Nagadhanwana. Swarming<br>with numerous snakes, O monarch, it was the abode of Vasuki of great<br>splendour, the king of the snakes. There 14,000 Rishis also had their<br>permanent home. The celestials, having come there (in days of yore), had<br>according to due rites, installed the excellent snake Vasuki as king of<br>all the snakes. There is no fear of snakes in that place, O thou of<br>Kuru's race! Duly giving away many valuables there unto the Brahmanas,<br>Baladeva then set out with face towards the east and reached, one after<br>another, hundreds and thousands of famous tirthas that occurred at every<br>step. Bathing in all those tirthas, and observing fasts and other vows as<br>directed by the Rishis, and giving away wealth in profusion, and saluting<br>all the ascetics who had taken up their residence there, Baladeva once<br>more set out, along the way that those ascetics pointed out to him, for<br>reaching that spot where the Sarasvati turns in an eastward direction,<br>like torrents of rain bent by the action of the wind. The river took that<br>course for beholding the high-souled Rishis dwelling in the forest of<br>Naimisha. Always smeared with white sandalpaste, Vala, having the plough<br>for his weapon, beholding that foremost of rivers change her course,<br>became, O king, filled with wonder."<br><br>Janamejaya said, "Why, O Brahmana, did the Sarasvati bend her course<br>there in an easternly direction? O best of Adharyus, it behoveth thee to<br>tell me everything relating to this! For what reason was that daughter of<br>the Yadus filled with wonder? Why, indeed, did that foremost of rivers<br>thus alter her course?"<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "Formerly, in the Krita age, O king, the ascetics<br>dwelling in Naimisha were engaged in a grand sacrifice extending for<br>twelve years. Many were the Rishis, O king, that came to that sacrifice.<br>Passing their days, according to due rites, in the performance of that<br>sacrifice, those highly blessed ones, after the completion of that twelve<br>years' sacrifice at Naimisha, set out in large number for visiting the<br>tirthas. In consequence of the number of the Rishis, O king, the tirthas<br>on the southern banks of the Sarasvati all looked like towns and cities.<br>Those foremost of Brahmanas, O tiger among men, in consequence of their<br>eagerness for enjoying the merits of tirthas, took up their abodes on the<br>bank of the river up to the site of Samantapanchaka. The whole region<br>seemed to resound with the loud Vedic recitations of those Rishis of<br>cleansed souls, all employed in pouring libations on sacrificial fires.<br>That foremost of rivers looked exceedingly beautiful with those blazing<br>homa fires all around, over which those high-souled ascetics poured<br>libations of clarified butter. Valkhilyas and Asmakuttas,<br>Dantolakhalinas, Samprakshanas and other ascetics, as also those that<br>subsisted on air, and those that lived on water, and those that lived on<br>dry leaves of trees, and diverse others that were observant of diverse<br>kinds of vows, and those that forswore beds for the bare and hard earth,<br>all came to that spot in the vicinity of the Sarasvati. And they made<br>that foremost of rivers exceedingly beautiful, like the celestials<br>beautifying (with their presence) the heavenly stream called Mandakini.<br>Hundreds upon hundreds of Rishis, all given to the observance of<br>sacrifices, came thither. Those practisers of high vows, however, failed<br>to find sufficient room on the banks of the Sarasvati. Measuring small<br>plots of land with their sacred threads, they performed their Agnihotras<br>and diverse other rites. The river Sarasvati beheld, O monarch, that<br>large body of Rishis penetrated with despair and plunged into anxiety for<br>want of a broad tirtha wherein to perform their rites. For their sake,<br>that foremost of streams came there, having made many abodes for herself<br>in that spot, through kindness for those Rishis of sacred penances, O<br>Janamejaya! Having thus, O monarch, turned her course for their sake, the<br>Sarasvati, that foremost of rivers, once more flowed in a westerly<br>direction, as if she said, 'I must go hence, having prevented the arrival<br>of these Rishis from becoming futile!' This wonderful feat, O king, was<br>accomplished there by that great river. Even thus those receptacles of<br>water, O king, were formed in Naimisha. There, at Kurukshetra, O foremost<br>of Kuru's care, do thou perform grand sacrifices and rites! As he beheld<br>those many receptacles of water and seeing that foremost of rivers turn<br>her course, wonder filled the heart of the high-souled Rama. Bathing in<br>those tirthas duly and giving away wealth and diverse articles of<br>enjoyment unto the Brahmanas, that delighter of Yadu's race also gave<br>away diverse kinds of food and diverse desirable articles unto them.<br>Worshipped by those regenerate ones, Vala, O king, then set out from that<br>foremost of all tirthas on the Sarasvati (Sapta-Saraswat). Numerous<br>feathery creatures have their home there. And it abounded with Vadari,<br>Inguda, Ksamarya, Plaksha, Aswattha, Vibhitaka, Kakkola, Palasa, Karira,<br>Pilu, and diverse other kinds of trees that grow on the banks of the<br>Sarasvati. And it was adorned with forest of Karushakas, Vilwas, and<br>Amratakas, and Atimuktas and Kashandas and Parijatas. Agreeable to the<br>sight and most charming, it abounded with forests of plantains. And it<br>was resorted to by diverse tribes of ascetics, some living on air, some<br>on water, some on fruit, some on leaves, some on raw grain which they<br>husked with the aid only of stones, and some that were called Vaneyas.<br>And it resounded with the chanting of the Vedas, and teemed with diverse<br>kinds of animals. And it was the favourite abode of men without malice<br>and devoted to righteousness. Valadeva, having the plough for his weapon,<br>arrived at that tirtha called Sapta-Saraswat, where the great ascetic<br>Mankanaka had performed his penances and became crowned with success."
