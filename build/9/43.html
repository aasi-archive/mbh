                            Vaishampayana said, "Cursed by the intelligent Vishvamitra in anger,<br>Sarasvati, in that auspicious and best of tirthas, flowed, bearing blood<br>in her current. Then, O king, many Rakshasas came, O Bharata, and lived<br>happily there, drinking the blood that flowed. Exceedingly gratified with<br>that blood, cheerfully and without anxiety of any kind, they danced and<br>laughed there like persons that have (by merit) attained to heaven. After<br>some time had passed away, some Rishis, possessed of wealth of<br>asceticism, came to the Sarasvati, O king, on a sojourn to her tirthas.<br>Those foremost of Munis, having bathed in all the tirthas and obtained<br>great happiness, became desirous of acquiring more merit. Those learned<br>persons at last came, O king, to that tirtha where the Sarasvati ran a<br>bloody current. Those highly blessed ones, arriving at that frightful<br>tirtha, saw the water of the Sarasvati mixed with blood and that<br>innumerable Rakshasas, O monarch, were drinking it. Beholding those<br>Rakshasas, O king, those ascetics of rigid vows made great endeavours for<br>rescuing the Sarasvati from that plight. Those blessed ones of high vows,<br>arrived there, invoked that foremost of rivers and said these words unto<br>her, 'Tell us the reason, O auspicious lady, why this lake in thee hath<br>been afflicted with such distress Hearing it, we shall endeavour (to<br>restore it to its proper condition).' Thus questioned, Sarasvati,<br>trembling as she spoke, informed them of everything that had occurred.<br>Seeing her afflicted with woe, those ascetics said, 'We have heard the<br>reason. We have heard of thy curse, O sinless lady! All of us shall exert<br>ourselves!' Having said these words unto that foremost of rivers, they<br>then consulted with one another thus, 'All of us shall emancipate<br>Sarasvati from her curse.' Then all those Brahmanas, O king, worshipping<br>Mahadeva, that lord of the universe and protector of all creatures, with<br>penance and vows and fasts and diverse kinds of abstinences and painful<br>observances, emancipated that foremost of rivers, the divine Sarasvati.<br>Beholding the water of Sarasvati purified by those Munis, the Rakshasas<br>(that had taken up their abode there), afflicted with hunger, sought the<br>protection of those Munis themselves. Afflicted with hunger, the<br>Rakshasas, with joined hands, repeatedly said unto those ascetics filled<br>with compassion, these words, 'All of us are hungry! We have swerved from<br>eternal virtue! That we are sinful in behaviour is not of our free will!<br>Through the absence of your, grace and through our own evil acts, as also<br>through the sexual sins of our women, our demerits increase and we have<br>become Brahma-Rakshasas! So amongst Vaisyas and Sudras, and Kshatriyas,<br>those that hate and injure Brahmanas became Rakshasas. Ye best of<br>Brahmanas, make arrangements then for our relief! Ye are competent to<br>relieve all the worlds!' Hearing these words of theirs, those ascetics<br>praised the great river. For the rescue of those Rakshasas, with rapt<br>minds those ascetics said, 'The food over which one sneezed, that in<br>which there are worms and insects, that which may be mixed with any<br>leavings of dishes, that which is mixed with hair, that which is mixed<br>with tears, that which is trodden upon shall form the portion of these<br>Rakshasas! The learned man, knowing all this, shall carefully avoid these<br>kinds of food. He that shall take such food shall be regarded as eating<br>the food of Rakshasas!' Having purified the tirtha in this way, those<br>ascetics thus solicited that river for the relief of those Rakshasas.<br>Understanding the views of those great Rishis, that foremost of rivers<br>caused her body, O bull among men, to assume a new shape called Aruna.<br>Bathing in that new river (a branch of the Sarasvati) the Rakshasas cast<br>off their bodies and went to heaven. Ascertaining all this, the chief of<br>the celestials, (Indra of a hundred sacrifices), bathed in that foremost<br>of tirthas and became cleansed of a grievous sin."<br><br>Janamejaya said, "For what reason was Indra tainted with the sin of<br>Brahmanicide? How also did he become cleansed by bathing in that tirtha?"<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "Listen to that history, O ruler of men! Hear of<br>those occurrences as they happened! Hear how Vasava, in days of yore,<br>broke his treaty with Namuchi! The Asura Namuchi, from fear of Vasava,<br>had entered a ray of the Sun. Indra then made friends with Namuchi and<br>entered into a covenant with him, saying, 'O foremost of Asuras, I shall<br>not slay thee, O friend, with anything that is wet or with anything that<br>is dry! I shall not slay thee in the night or in the day! I swear this to<br>thee by truth. Having made this covenant, the lord Indra one day beheld a<br>fog. He then, O king, cut off Namuchi's head, using the foam of water (as<br>his weapon). The severed head of Namuchi thereupon pursued Indra from<br>behind, saying unto him from a near point these words, 'O slayer of a<br>friend, O wretch!' Urged on incessantly by that head, Indra repaired to<br>the Grandsire and informed him, in grief, of what had occurred. The<br>Supreme Lord of the universe said unto him, 'Performing a sacrifice,<br>bathe with due rites, O chief of the celestials, in Aruna, that tirtha<br>which saveth from the fear of sin! The water of that river, O Shakra,<br>hath been made sacred by the Munis! Formerly the presence of that river<br>at its site was concealed. The divine Sarasvati repaired to the Aruna,<br>and flooded it with her waters. This confluence of Sarasvati and Aruna is<br>highly sacred! Thither, O chief of the celestials, perform a sacrifice!<br>Give away gifts in profusion! Performing thy ablutions there, thou shall<br>be freed from thy sin.' Thus addressed, Shakra, at these words of Brahma,<br>O Janamejaya, performed in that abode of Sarasvati diverse sacrifices.<br>Giving away many gifts and bathing in that tirtha, he of a hundred<br>sacrifices, the piercer of Vala, duly performed certain sacrifices and<br>then plunged in the Aruna. He became freed from the sin arising out of<br>the slaughter of a Brahmana. The lord of heaven then returned to heaven<br>with a joyful heart. The head of Namuchi also fell into that stream, O<br>Bharata, and the Asura obtained many eternal regions, O best of kings,<br>that granted every wish."<br><br>Vaishampayana continued, "The high-souled Baladeva having bathed in that<br>tirtha and given away many kinds of gifts, obtained great merit. Of<br>righteous deeds, he then proceeded to the great tirtha of Soma. There, in<br>days of yore, Soma himself, O king of kings, had performed the Rajasuya<br>sacrifice. The high-souled Atri, that foremost of Brahmanas, gifted with<br>great intelligence became the Hotri in that grand sacrifice. Upon the<br>conclusion of that sacrifice, a great battle took place between the gods<br>(on the one side) and the Danavas, the Daityas, and the Rakshasas (on the<br>other). That fierce battle is known after the name of (the Asura) Taraka.<br>In that battle Skanda slew Taraka. There, on that occasion, Mahasena<br>(Skanda), that destroyer of Daityas, obtained the command of the<br>celestial forces. In that tirtha is a gigantic Aswattha tree. Under its<br>shade, Kartikeya, otherwise called Kumara, always resides in person."
