                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Kicked at the head, his thighs broken, prostrated<br>on the ground, exceedingly proud, what, O Sanjaya, did my son then say?<br>King Duryodhana was exceedingly wrathful and his hostility to the sons of<br>Pandu was deep-rooted. When therefore this great calamity overtook him,<br>what did he next say on the field?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Listen to me, O monarch, as I describe to thee what<br>happened. Listen, O king, to what Duryodhana said when overtaken by<br>calamity. With his thighs broken, the king, O monarch, covered with dust,<br>gathered his flowing locks, casting his eyes on all sides. Having with<br>difficulty gathered his locks, he began to sigh like a snake. Filled with<br>rage and with tears flowing fast from his eyes, he looked at me. He<br>struck his arms against the Earth for a while like an infuriated<br>elephant. Shaking his loose locks, and gnashing his teeth, he began to<br>censure the eldest son of Pandu. Breathing heavily, he then addressed me,<br>saying, "Alas, I who had Santanu's son Bhishma for my protector, and<br>Karna, that foremost of all wielders of weapons and Gotama's son,<br>Shakuni, and Drona, that first of all wielders of arms, and Ashvatthama,<br>and the heroic Shalya, and Kritavarma, alas, even I have come to this<br>plight! It seems that Time is irresistible! I was the lord of eleven<br>Chamus of troops and yet I have come to this plight! O mighty-armed one,<br>no one can rise superior to Time! Those of my side that have escaped with<br>life from this battle should be informed, how I have been struck down by<br>Bhimasena in contravention of the rules of fair fight! Many have been the<br>very unfair and sinful acts that have been perpetrated towards<br>Bhurishrava, and Bhishma, and Drona of great prosperity! This is another<br>very infamous act that the cruel Pandavas have perpetrated, for which, I<br>am certain, they will incur the condemnation of all righteous men! What<br>pleasure can a righteously disposed person enjoy at having gained a<br>victory by unfair acts? What wise man, again, is there that would accord<br>his approbation to a person contravening the rules of fairness? What<br>learned man is there that would rejoice after having won victory by<br>unrighteousness as that sinful wretch, Vrikodara the son of Pandu,<br>rejoices? What can be more amazing than this, that Bhimasena in wrath<br>should with his foot touch the head of one like me while lying with my<br>thighs broken? Is that person, O Sanjaya, worthy of honour who behaveth<br>thus towards a man possessed of glory endued with prosperity, living in<br>the midst of friends? My parents are not ignorant of the duties of<br>battle. Instructed by me, O Sanjaya, tell them that are afflicted with<br>grief these words: I have performed sacrifices, supported a large number<br>of servants properly, governed the whole earth with her seas! I stayed on<br>the heads of my living foes! I gave wealth to my kinsmen to the extent of<br>my abilities, and I did what was agreeable to friends. I withstood all my<br>foes. Who is there that is more fortunate than myself? I have made<br>progresses through hostile kingdoms and commanded kings as slaves. I have<br>acted handsomely towards all I loved and liked. Who is there more<br>fortunate than myself? I honoured all my kinsmen and attended to the<br>welfare of all my dependants. I have attended to the three ends of human<br>existence, Religion, Profit, and Pleasure! Who is there more fortunate<br>than myself? I laid my commands on great kings, and honour, unattainable<br>by others, was mine, I always made my journeys on the very best of<br>steeds. Who is there more fortunate than myself? I studied the Vedas and<br>made gifts according to the ordinance. My life has passed in happiness.<br>By observance of the duties of my own order, I have earned many regions<br>of blessedness hereafter. Who is there more fortunate than myself? By<br>good luck, I have not been vanquished in battle and subjected to the<br>necessity of serving my foes as masters. By good luck, O lord, it is only<br>after my death that my swelling prosperity abandons me for waiting upon<br>another! That which is desired by good Kshatriyas observant of the duties<br>of their order, that death, is obtained by me! Who is there so fortunate<br>as myself? By good luck, I did not suffer myself to be turned away from<br>the path of hostility and to be vanquished like an ordinary person! By<br>good luck, I have not been vanquished after I had done some base act!<br>Like the slaughter of a person that is asleep or that is heedless, like<br>the slaughter of one by the administration of poison, my slaughter hath<br>taken place, for I have been slain as unrighteously, in contravention of<br>the rules of fair fight! The highly blessed Ashvatthama, and Kritavarma<br>of the Satwata race, and Saradwat's son Kripa, should be told these words<br>of mine, 'You should never repose any confidence upon the Pandavas, those<br>violators of rules, who have perpetrated many unrighteous acts!' After<br>this, thy royal son of true prowess addressed our message-bearers in<br>these words, "I have, in battle, been slain by Bhimasena most<br>unrighteously! I am now like a moneyless wayfarer and shall follow in the<br>wake of Drona who has already gone to heaven, of Karna and Shalya, of<br>Vrishasena of great energy, of Shakuni the son of Subala, of Jalasandha<br>of great valour, of king Bhagadatta, of Somadatta's son, that mighty<br>bowman, of Jayadratha, the king of the Sindhus, of all my brothers headed<br>by Duhshasana and equal unto myself, of Duhshasana's son of great<br>prowess, and of Lakshmana, my son, and thousands of others that fought<br>for me. Alas how shall my sister, stricken with woe, live sorrowfully,<br>after hearing of the slaughter of her brothers and her husband! Alas,<br>what shall be the plight of the old king, my sire, with Gandhari, and his<br>daughters-in-law and grand-daughters-in-law! Without doubt, the beautiful<br>and large-eyed mother of Lakshmana, made sonless and husbandless, will<br>soon meet with her death! If Charvaka, the mendicant devotee who is a<br>master of speech, learns everything, that blessed man will certainly<br>avenge himself of my death! By dying upon the sacred field of<br>Samantapanchaka, celebrated over the three worlds, I shall certainly<br>obtain many eternal regions!" Then, O sire, thousands of men, with eyes<br>full of tears, fled away in all directions, having heard these<br>lamentations of the king. The whole Earth, with her forests and seas,<br>with all her mobile and immobile creatures, began to tremble violently,<br>and produce a loud noise. All the points of the compass became murky. The<br>messengers, repairing to Drona's son, represented to him all that had<br>happened regarding the conduct of the mace-encounter and the fall of the<br>king. Having represented everything unto Drona's son, O Bharata, all of<br>them remained in a thoughtful mood for a long while and then went away,<br>grief-stricken, to the place they came from.'"
