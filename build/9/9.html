                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then commenced the battle between the Kurus and the<br>Srinjayas, O monarch, that was as fierce and awful as the battle between<br>the gods and the Asuras. Men and crowds of cars and elephants, and<br>elephant-warriors and horsemen by thousands, and steeds, all possessed of<br>great prowess, encountered one another. The loud noise of rushing<br>elephants of fearful forms was then heard there resembling the roars of<br>the clouds in the welkin, in the season of rains. Some car-warriors,<br>struck by elephants, were deprived of their cars. Routed by those<br>infuriate animals other brave combatants ran on the field. Well-trained<br>car-warriors, O Bharata, with their shafts, despatched large bodies of<br>cavalry and the footmen that urged and protected the elephants, to the<br>other world. Well-trained horsemen, O king, surrounding great<br>car-warriors, careered on the field, striking and slaying the latter with<br>spears and darts and swords. Some combatants armed with bows,<br>encompassing great car-warriors, despatched them to Yama's abode, the<br>many unitedly battling against individual ones. Other great car-warriors,<br>encompassing elephants and foremost warriors of their own class, slew<br>some mighty one amongst that fought on the field, careering all around.<br>Similarly, O king, elephants, encompassing individual car-warriors<br>excited with wrath and scattering showers of shafts, despatched them to<br>the other world. Elephant-warrior rushing against elephant-warrior and<br>car-warrior against car-warrior in that battle slew each other with darts<br>and lances and cloth-yard shafts, O Bharata. Cars and elephants and<br>horses, crushing foot-soldiers in the midst of battle, were seen to make<br>confusion worse confounded. Adorned with yak-tails, steeds rushed on all<br>sides, looking like the swans found on the plains at the foot of Himavat.<br>They rushed with such speed that they seemed ready to devour the very<br>Earth. The field, O monarch, indented with the hoofs of those steeds,<br>looked beautiful like a beautiful woman bearing the marks of (her<br>lover's) nails on her person. With the noise made by the tread of heroes,<br>the wheels of cars, the shouts of foot-soldiers, the grunts of elephants,<br>the peal of drums and other musical instruments, and the blare of conchs,<br>the Earth began to resound as if with deafening peals of thunder. In<br>consequence of twanging bows and flashing sabres and the glaring armour<br>of the combatants, all became so confused there, that nothing could be<br>distinctly marked. Invulnerable arms, lopped off from human bodies, and<br>looking like the tusks of elephants, jumped up and writhed and moved<br>furiously about. The sound made, O monarch, by heads falling on the field<br>of battle, resembled that made by the falling fruits of palmyra trees.<br>Strewn with those fallen heads that were crimson with blood, the Earth<br>looked resplendent as if adorned with gold-coloured lotuses in their<br>season. Indeed, with those lifeless heads with upturned eyes, that were<br>exceedingly mangled (with shafts and other weapons), the field of battle,<br>O king, looked resplendent as if strewn with full blown lotuses. With the<br>fallen arms of the combatants, smeared with sandal and adorned with<br>costly Keyuras, the earth looked bright as if strewn with the gorgeous<br>poles set up in Indra's honour. The field of battle became covered with<br>the thighs of kings, cut off in that battle and looking like the tapering<br>trunks of elephants. Teeming with hundreds of headless trunk and strewn<br>with umbrellas and yak-tails, that vast army looked beautiful like a<br>flowering forest. Then, on the field of battle, O monarch, warriors<br>careered fearlessly, their limbs bathed in blood and therefore looking<br>like flowering Kinsukas. Elephants also, afflicted with arrows and<br>lances, fell down here and there like broken clouds dropped from the<br>skies. Elephant divisions, O monarch, slaughtered by high-souled<br>warriors, dispersed in all directions like wind-tossed clouds. Those<br>elephants, looking like clouds, fell down on the Earth, like mountains<br>riven with thunder, O lord, on the occasion of the dissolution of the<br>world at the end of the Yuga. Heaps upon heaps, looking like mountains,<br>were seen, lying on the ground, of fallen steeds with their riders. A<br>river appeared on the field of battle, flowing towards the other world.<br>Blood formed its waters and cars its eddies. Standards formed its trees,<br>and bones its pebbles. The arms (of combatants) were its alligators, bows<br>its current, elephants its large rocks, and steeds its smaller ones. Fat<br>and marrow formed its mire, umbrellas its swans, and maces its rafts.<br>Abounding with armour and head-gears, banners constituted its beautiful<br>trees. Teeming with wheels that formed its swarms of Chakravakas, it was<br>covered with Trivenus and Dandas. Inspiring the brave with delight and<br>enhancing the fears of the timid, that fierce river set in, whose shores<br>abounded with Kurus and Srinjayas. Those brave warriors, with arms<br>resembling spiked bludgeons, by the aid of their vehicles and animals<br>serving the purposes of rafts and boats, crossed that awful river which<br>ran towards the region of the dead. During the progress of that battle, O<br>monarch, in which no consideration was shown by anybody for anyone, and<br>which, fraught with awful destruction of the four kinds of forces,<br>therefore, resembled the battle between the gods and the Asuras in days<br>of old, some among the combatants, O scorcher of foes, loudly called upon<br>their kinsmen and friends. Some, called upon by crying kinsmen, returned,<br>afflicted with fear. During the progress of that fierce and awful battle,<br>Arjuna and Bhimasena stupefied their foes. That vast host of thine, O<br>ruler of men, thus slaughtered, swooned away on the field, like a woman<br>under the influence of liquor. Having stupefied that army, Bhimasena and<br>Dhananjaya blew their conchs and uttered leonine roars. As soon as they<br>heard that loud peal, Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi, placing king<br>Yudhishthira at their head, rushed against the ruler of the Madras.<br>Exceedingly wonderful and terrible, O monarch, was the manner in which<br>those heroes, unitedly and as separate bodies, then fought with Shalya.<br>The two sons of Madri, endued with great activity, accomplished in<br>weapons, and invincible in battle, proceeded with great speed against thy<br>host, inspired with desire of victory. Then thy army, O bull of Bharata's<br>race, mangled in diverse ways with shafts by the Pandavas eager for<br>victory, began to fly away from the field. That host, thus struck and<br>broken by firm bowmen, O monarch, fled away on all sides in the very<br>sight of thy sons. Loud cries of "Oh!" and "Alas!" O Bharata, arose from<br>among thy warriors, while some illustrious Kshatriyas among the routed<br>combatants, desirous of victory, cried out saying, "Stop, stop!" For all<br>that, those troops of thine, broken by the Pandavas, fled away, deserting<br>on the field their dear sons and brothers and maternal, uncles and<br>sister's sons and relatives by marriage and other kinsmen. Urging their<br>steeds and elephants to greater speed, thousands of warriors fled away, O<br>bull of Bharata's race, bent only upon their own safety.'"
