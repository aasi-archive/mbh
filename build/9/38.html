                            Janamejaya said, "Why was that tirtha called Sapta-Saraswat? Who was the<br>ascetic Mankanaka? How did that adorable one become crowned with success?<br>What were his vows and observances? In whose race was he born? What books<br>did that best of regenerate ones study? I desire to hear all this, O<br>foremost of regenerate ones!"<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "O king, the seven Sarasvatis cover this universe!<br>Whithersoever the Sarasvati was summoned by persons of great energy,<br>thither she made her appearance. These are the seven forms of the<br>Sarasvati: Suprava, Kanchanakshi, Visala, Manorama, Oghavati, Surenu, and<br>Vimalodaka. The Supreme Grandsire had at one time performed a great<br>sacrifice. While that sacrifice was in course of performance on the<br>ground selected, many regenerate ones crowned with ascetic success came<br>there. The spot resounded with the recitation of sacred hymns and the<br>chanting of the Vedas. In the matter of those sacrificial rites, the very<br>gods lost their coolness (so grand were the preparations). There, O<br>monarch, while the Grandsire was installed in the sacrifice and was<br>performing the grand ceremony capable of bestowing prosperity and every<br>wish, many notable ones conversant with righteousness and profit were<br>present. As soon as they thought of the articles of which they stood in<br>need, these, O monarch, immediately appeared before the regenerate ones<br>(among the guests) that came there. The Gandharvas sang and the diverse<br>tribes of Apsaras danced. And they played upon many celestial instruments<br>all the time. The wealth of provisions procured in that sacrifice<br>satisfied the very gods. What shall I say then of human beings? The very<br>celestials became filled with wonder! During the continuance of that<br>sacrifice at Pushkara and in the presence of the Grandsire, the Rishis, O<br>king, said, 'This sacrifice cannot be said to possess high attributes,<br>since that foremost of rivers, Sarasvati, is not to be seen here!'<br>Hearing these words, the divine Brahman cheerfully thought of Sarasvati.<br>Summoned at Pushkara by the Grandsire engaged in the performance of a<br>sacrifice, Sarasvati, O king, appeared there, under the name of Suprava.<br>Beholding Sarasvati quickly pay that regard to the Grandsire, the Munis<br>esteemed that sacrifice highly. Even thus that foremost of rivers, the<br>Sarasvati, made her appearance at Pushkara for the sake of the Grandsire<br>and for gratifying the Munis. (At another time), O king, many Munis,<br>mustering together at Naimisha, took up their residence there. Delightful<br>disquisition occurred among them, O king, about the Vedas. There where<br>those Munis, conversant with diverse scriptures, took up their abode,<br>there they thought of the Sarasvati. Thus thought of, O monarch, by those<br>Rishis performing a sacrifice, the highly blessed and sacred Sarasvati,<br>for rendering assistance, O king, to those high-souled Munis assembled<br>together, made her appearance at Naimisha and came to be called<br>Kanchanakshi. That foremost of rivers, worshipped by all, thus came<br>there, O Bharata! While (king) Gaya was engaged in the performance of a<br>great sacrifice at Gaya, the foremost of rivers, Sarasvati, summoned at<br>Gaya's sacrifice (made her appearance there). The Rishis of rigid vows<br>that were there, named this form of hers at Gaya as Visala. That river of<br>swift current flows from the sides of the Himavat. Auddalaka had also, O<br>Bharata, performed a sacrifice. A large concourse of Munis had been<br>gathered there. It was on that sacred region, the northern part of<br>Kosala, O king, that the sacrifice of high-souled Auddalaka was<br>performed. Before Auddalaka began his sacrifice, he had thought of the<br>Sarasvati. That foremost of rivers came to that region for the sake of<br>those Rishis. Worshipped by all those Munis clad in barks and deer-skins<br>she became known by the name of Manorama, as those Rishis mentally called<br>her. While, again, the high-souled Kuru was engaged in a sacrifice at<br>Kurukshetra, that foremost of rivers, the highly blessed Sarasvati, made<br>her appearance there. Summoned, O monarch, by the high-souled Vasishtha<br>(who assisted Kuru in his sacrifice), the Sarasvati, full of celestial<br>water appeared at Kurukshetra under the name of Oghavati. Daksha at one<br>time performed a sacrifice at the source of Ganga. The Sarasvati appeared<br>there under the name of the fast-flowing Surenu. Once again, while<br>Brahman was engaged in a sacrifice on the sacred forest of the Himavat<br>mountains, the adorable Sarasvati, summoned (by him), appeared there. All<br>these seven forms then came and joined together in that tirtha where<br>Baladeva came. And because the seven mingled together at that spot,<br>therefore is that tirtha known on Earth by the name of Sapta Sarasvati.<br>Thus have I told thee of the seven Sarasvatis, according to their names.<br>I have also told thee of the sacred tirtha called Sapta Saraswat. Listen<br>now to a great feat of Mankanaka, who had from his youth led the life of<br>a brahmacari. While employed in performing his ablutions in the river, he<br>beheld (one day), O Bharata, a woman of faultless limbs and fair brows,<br>bathing in the river at will, her person uncovered. At this sight, O<br>monarch, the vital seed of the Rishi fell unto the Sarasvati. The great<br>ascetic took it up and placed it within his earthen pot. Kept within that<br>vessel, the fluid became divided into seven parts. From those seven<br>portions were born seven Rishis from whom sprang the (nine and forty)<br>Maruts. The seven Rishis were named Vayuvega, Vayuhan, Vayumandala,<br>Vayujata, Vayuretas, and Vayuchakra of great energy. Thus were born these<br>progenitors of the diverse Maruts. Hear now a more wonderful thing, O<br>king, a fact exceedingly marvellous on Earth, about the conduct of the<br>great Rishi, which is well known in the three worlds. In days of yore,<br>after Mankanaka had become crowned with success, O king, his hand, on one<br>occasion, became pierced with a Kusa blade. Thereupon, a vegetable juice<br>came out of the wound (and not red blood). Seeing that vegetable juice,<br>the Rishi became filled with joy and danced about on the spot. Seeing him<br>dance, all mobile and immobile creatures, O hero, stupefied by his<br>energy, began to dance. Then the gods with Brahman at their head, and the<br>Rishis possessed of wealth of asceticism, O king, all went to Mahadeva<br>and informed him of the act of the Rishi (Mankanaka). And they said unto<br>him, 'It behoveth thee, O god, to do that which may prevent the Rishi<br>from dancing!' Then Mahadeva, seeing the Rishi filled with great joy, and<br>moved by the desire of doing good unto the gods, addressed him, saying,<br>'Why, O Brahmana, dost thou dance in this way, acquainted as thou art<br>with thy duties? What grave cause is there for such joy of thine, O sage,<br>that, an ascetic as thou art, O best of Brahmanas, and walking as thou<br>dost along the path of virtue, thou shouldst act in this way?'<br><br>"The Rishi said, 'Why, seest thou not, O Brahmana, that a vegetable juice<br>is flowing from this wound of mine? Seeing this, O lord, I am dancing in<br>great joy!' Laughing at the Rishi who was stupefied by passion, the god<br>said, 'I do not, O Brahmana, at all wonder at this! Behold me!' Having<br>said this unto that foremost of Rishis, Mahadeva of great intelligence<br>struck his thumb with the end of one of his fingers. Thereupon, O king,<br>ashes, white as snow, came out of that wound. Seeing this, the Rishi<br>became ashamed, O monarch, and fell at the feet of the god. He understood<br>the god to be none else than Mahadeva. Filled with wonder, he said, 'I do<br>not think that thou art any one else than Rudra, that great and Supreme<br>being! O wielder of the trident, thou art the refuge of this universe<br>consisting of gods and Asuras! The wise say that this universe hath been<br>created by thee! At the universal destruction, everything once more<br>enters thee! Thou art incapable of being known by the gods, how then<br>canst thou be known by me? All forms of being that are in the universe<br>are seen in thee! The gods with Brahman at their head worship thy boon<br>giving self, O sinless one! Thou art everything! Thou art the creator of<br>the gods and it was thou who hadst caused them to be created! Through thy<br>grace, the gods pass their time in joy and perfect fearlessness!' Having<br>praised Mahadeva in this manner, the Rishi bowed to him, 'Let not this<br>absence of gravity, ridiculous in the extreme, that I displayed, O god,<br>destroy my ascetic merit! I pray to thee for this!' The god, with a<br>cheerful heart, once more said unto him 'Let thy asceticism increase a<br>thousandfold, O Brahmana, through my grace! I shall also always dwell<br>with thee in this asylum! For the man that will worship me in the tirtha<br>Sapta-Saraswat there will be nothing unattainable here or hereafter.<br>Without doubt, such a one shall go to the region called Saraswat (in<br>heaven) after death!' Even this is the history of Mankanaka of abundant<br>energy. He was a son begotten by the god of wind upon (the lady) Sukanya."
