                            Janamejaya said, "On the eve of the great battle (between the Kurus and<br>the Pandus), the lord Rama, with Keshava's leave, had gone away (from<br>Dwaraka) accompanied by many of the Vrishnis. He had said unto Keshava,<br>'I will render aid neither unto the son of Dhritarashtra nor unto the<br>sons of Pandu, but will go whithersoever I like!' Having said these<br>words, Rama, that resister of foes, had gone away. It behoveth thee, O<br>Brahmana, to tell me everything about his return! Tell me in detail how<br>Rama came to that spot, how he witnessed the battle. In my opinion thou<br>art well-skilled in narration!"<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "After the high-souled Pandavas had taken up their<br>post at Upaplavya, they despatched the slayer of Madhu to Dhritarashtra's<br>presence, for the object of peace, O mighty-armed one, and for the good<br>of all creatures. Having gone to Hastinapura and met Dhritarashtra,<br>Keshava spoke words of true and especially beneficial import. The king,<br>however, as I have told thee before, listened not to those counsels.<br>Unable to obtain peace, the mighty-armed Krishna, that foremost of men,<br>came back, O monarch, to Upaplavya. Dismissed by Dhritarashtra's son,<br>Krishna returned (to the Pandava camp), and upon the failure of his<br>mission, O tiger among kings, said these words unto the Pandavas, 'Urged<br>by Fate, the Kauravas are for disregarding my words! Come, ye sons of<br>Pandu, with me (to the field of battle), setting out under the<br>constellation Pushya!' After this, while the troops (of both sides) were<br>being mustered and arrayed, the high-souled son of Rohini, that foremost<br>of all persons endued with might, addressed his brother Krishna, saying,<br>'O mighty-armed one, O slayer of Madhu, let us render assistance to the<br>Kurus!' Krishna, however, did not listen to those words of his. With<br>heart filled with rage (at this), that illustrious son of Yadu's race,<br>the wielder of the plough then set out on a pilgrimage to the Sarasvati.<br>Accompanied by all the Yadavas, he set out under the conjunction of the<br>asterism called Maitra. The Bhoja chief (Kritavarma), however, adopted<br>the side of Duryodhana. Accompanied by Yuyudhana, Vasudeva adopted that<br>of the Pandavas. After the heroic son of Rohini had set out under the<br>constellation Pushya, the slayer of Madhu, placing the Pandavas in his<br>van, proceeded against the Kurus. While proceeding, Rama ordered his<br>servants on the way, saying, 'Bring all things that are necessary for a<br>pilgrimage, that is, every article of use! Bring the (sacred) fire that<br>is at Dwaraka, and our priests. Bring gold, silver, kine, robes, steeds,<br>elephants, cars, mules, camels, and other draft cattle! Bring all these<br>necessaries for a trip to the sacred waters, and proceed with great speed<br>towards the Sarasvati! Bring also some priests to be especially employed,<br>and hundreds of foremost of Brahmanas!' Having given these orders to the<br>servants, the mighty Valadeva set out on a pilgrimage at that time of<br>great calamity to the Kurus. Setting out towards the Sarasvati, he<br>visited all the sacred places along her course, accompanied by priests,<br>friends, and many foremost of Brahmanas, as also with cars and elephants<br>and steeds and servants, O bull of Bharata's race, and with many vehicles<br>drawn by kine and mules and camels. Diverse kinds of necessaries of life<br>were given away in large measure and in diverse countries unto the weary<br>and worn, children and the old, in response, O king, to solicitations.<br>Everywhere, O king, Brahmanas were promptly gratified with whatever<br>viands they desired. At the command of Rohini's son, men at different<br>stages of the journey stored food and drink in large quantities. Costly<br>garments and bedsteads and coverlets were given for the gratification of<br>Brahmanas, desirous of ease and comfort. Whatever Brahmana or Kshatriya<br>solicited whatever thing, that O Bharata, it was seen to be ungrudgingly<br>given to him. All who formed the party proceeded with great happiness and<br>lived happily. The people (of Valarama's train) gave away vehicles to<br>persons desirous of making journeys, drinks to them that were thirsty,<br>and savoury viands to them that were hungry, as also robes and ornaments,<br>O bull of Bharata's race, to many! The road, O king, along which the<br>party proceeded, looked resplendent, O hero, and was highly comfortable<br>for all, and resembled heaven itself. There were rejoicings everywhere<br>upon it, and savoury viands were procurable everywhere. There were shops<br>and stalls and diverse objects exposed for sale. The whole way was,<br>besides, crowded with human beings. And it was adorned with various kinds<br>of trees and creatures, and various kinds of gems. The high-souled<br>Valadeva, observant of rigid vows, gave away unto the Brahmanas much<br>wealth and plentiful sacrificial presents, O king, in diverse sacred<br>spots. That chief of Yadu's race also gave away thousands of milch kine<br>covered with excellent cloths and having their horns cased in gold, many<br>steeds belonging to different countries, many vehicles, and many<br>beautiful slaves. Even thus did the high-souled Rama give away wealth in<br>diverse excellent tirthas on the Sarasvati. In course of his wanderings,<br>that hero of unrivalled power and magnanimous conduct at last came to<br>Kurukshetra."<br><br>Janamejaya said, "Tell me, O foremost of men, the features, the origin,<br>and the merits of the several tirthas on the Sarasvati and the ordinances<br>to be observed while sojourning there! Tell me these, in their order, O<br>illustrious one! My curiosity is irrepressible, O foremost of all persons<br>acquainted with Brahma!"<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "The subject of the features and origin of all these<br>tirthas, O king, is very large. I shall, however, describe them to thee.<br>Listen to that sacred account in its entirety, O king! Accompanied by his<br>priests and friends, Valadeva first proceeded to the tirtha called<br>Prabhasa. There, the Lord of the constellations (Soma), who had been<br>affected with phthisis, became freed from his curse. Regaining energy<br>there, O king, he now illuminates the universe. And because that foremost<br>of tirthas on earth had formerly contributed to invest Soma with<br>splendour (after he had lost it), it is, therefore, called Prabhasa."<br><br>Janamejaya said, "For what reason was the adorable Soma afflicted with<br>phthisis? How also did he bathe in that tirtha? How did he, having bathed<br>in that sacred water, regain his energy? Tell me all this in detail, O<br>great Muni!"<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "Daksha had seven and twenty daughters, O king! These<br>he bestowed (in marriage) upon Soma. Connected with the several<br>constellations, those wives, O king, of Soma of auspicious deeds, served<br>to help men in calculating time. Possessed of large eyes, all of them<br>were unrivalled in beauty in the world. In wealth of beauty, however,<br>Rohini was the foremost of them all. The adorable Soma took great delight<br>in her. She became very agreeable to him, and therefore, he enjoyed the<br>pleasures of her company (exclusively). In those days of yore, O monarch,<br>Soma lived long with Rohini (exclusively). For this, those other wives of<br>his, they that were called the constellations, became displeased with<br>that high-souled one. Repairing speedily to their sire (Daksha), that<br>Lord of creation, they said unto him, 'Soma doth not live with us! He<br>always payeth court to Rohini only! All of us, therefore, O Lord of<br>creatures, shall dwell by thy side, on regulated diet and observant of<br>austere penances!' Hearing these words of theirs, Daksha (saw Soma and)<br>said unto him, 'Behave equally towards all thy wives! Let not a great sin<br>stain thee!' And Daksha then said unto those daughters of his, 'Go, all<br>of you, to the presence of Sasin. At my command, he, (otherwise called)<br>Candramas, will behave equally towards all of you!' Dismissed by him,<br>they then proceeded to the abode of him having cool rays. Still the<br>adorable Soma, O lord of earth, continued to act as before, for pleased<br>with Rohini alone, he continued to live with her exclusively. His other<br>wives then once more came together to their sire and said unto him,<br>'Employed in serving thee, we will dwell in thy asylum! Soma does not<br>live with us and is unmindful of thy commands!' Hearing these words of<br>theirs, Daksha once more said unto Soma, 'Behave equally towards all thy<br>wives! Let me not, O Virochana, curse thee!' Disregarding, however, these<br>words of Daksha, the adorable Soma continued to live with Rohini alone.<br>At this, his other wives became once more angry. Repairing to their sire,<br>they bowed unto him by lowering their heads, and said, 'Soma doth not<br>live with us! Give us thy protection! The adorable Candramas always lives<br>with Rohini exclusively! He sets no importance to thy words, and does not<br>wish to show us any affection! Therefore, save us so that Soma may accept<br>us all!' Hearing these words, the adorable Daksha, O king, became angry<br>and in consequence thereof hurled the curse of phthisis upon Soma. Thus<br>did that disease overtake the Lord of the stars. Afflicted with phthisis,<br>Sasin began to waste away day by day. He made many endeavours for freeing<br>himself from that disease by performing diverse sacrifices, O monarch!<br>The maker of night, however, could not free himself from that curse. On<br>the other hand, he continued to endure waste and emaciation. In<br>consequence, however, of the wasting of Soma, the deciduous herbs failed<br>to grow. Their juices dried up and they became tasteless, and all of them<br>became deprived of their virtues. And, in consequence of this decadence<br>of the deciduous herbs, living creatures also began to decay. Indeed,<br>owing to the wasting of Soma, all creatures began to be emaciated. Then<br>all the celestials, coming to Soma, O king, asked him, saying, 'Why is it<br>that thy form is not so beautiful and resplendent (as before)? Tell us<br>the reason whence hath proceeded this great calamity! Hearing thy answer,<br>we shall do what is needed for dispelling thy fear!' Thus addressed, the<br>god having the hare for his mark, replied unto them and informed them of<br>the cause of the curse and the phthisis with which he was afflicted. The<br>gods then, having heard those words, repaired to Daksha and said, 'Be<br>gratified, O adorable one, with Soma! Let this curse of thine be<br>withdrawn! Candramas is very emaciated! Only a small portion of him may<br>be seen! In consequence of his wasting, O Lord of the celestials, all<br>creatures also are wasting! Creepers and herbs of diverse kinds are also<br>wasting! In their waste we ourselves also are suffering emaciation!<br>Without us, what will this universe be? Knowing this, O master of the<br>universe, it behoveth thee to be gratified (with Soma)!' Thus addressed<br>(Daksha), that Lord of creatures, said these words unto the celestials,<br>'It is impossible to make my words become otherwise! By some contrivance,<br>however, ye blessed ones, my words may be withdrawn! Let Sasin always<br>behave equally towards all his wives! Having bathed also in that foremost<br>of tirthas on the Sarasvati, the god having the hare for his mark shall,<br>ye gods, grow once more! These words of mine are true! For half the month<br>Soma shall wane every day, and for half the month (following) he will wax<br>every day! These words of mine are true! Proceeding to the western Ocean<br>at the spot where the Sarasvati mingles with the Ocean, that vast<br>receptacle of waters, let him adore that God of gods (Mahadeva) there! He<br>will then regain his form and beauty!' At this command of the (celestial)<br>Rishi (Daksha), Soma then proceeded to the Sarasvati. He arrived at that<br>foremost of tirthas called Prabhasa belonging to the Sarasvati. Bathing<br>there on the day of the new moon, that god of great energy and great<br>effulgence got back his cool rays and continued once more to illumine the<br>worlds. All the creatures also, O monarch, having repaired to Prabhasa,<br>returned with Soma amongst them to the place where Daksha was. (Receiving<br>them duly) that Lord of creatures then dismissed them. Pleased with Soma,<br>the adorable Daksha once more addressed him, saying, 'Do not, O son,<br>disregard women, and never disregard Brahmanas! Go and attentively obey<br>my commands!' Dismissed by him, Soma came back to his own abode. All<br>creatures, filled with joy, continued to live as before. I have thus told<br>thee everything about how the maker of the night had been cursed, and,<br>how also Prabhasa became the foremost of all tirthas. On every recurring<br>day of the new moon, O monarch, the god having the hare for his mark<br>bathes in the excellent tirtha of Prabhasa and regains his form and<br>beauty. It is for this reason, O lord of earth, that that tirtha is known<br>by the name of Prabhasa, since bathing there, Candramas regained his<br>great (Prabha) effulgence. After this, the mighty Baladeva of undecaying<br>glory proceeded to Chamasodbheda, that is, to that tirtha which is called<br>by that name. Giving away many costly gifts at that place, the hero<br>having the plough for his weapon passed one night there and performed his<br>ablutions duly. The elder brother of Keshava then proceeded quickly to<br>Udapana. Although the Sarasvati seems to be lost there, yet persons<br>crowned with ascetic success, in consequence of their obtaining great<br>merits and great blessedness at that spot, and owing also to the coolness<br>of the herbs and of the land there, know that the river has an invisible<br>current, O monarch, through the bowels of the earth there."
