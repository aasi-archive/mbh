                            "Sanjaya said, 'Hearing these words of the (Kuru) king, the valiant<br>monarch (Shalya), O king, said these words unto Duryodhana in reply, "O<br>mighty-armed Duryodhana, listen to me, O foremost of eloquent men. Thou<br>regardest the two Krishnas, when on their car, to be the foremost of<br>car-warriors. They are not, however, together equal to me in might of<br>arms. What need I say of the Pandavas? When angry, I can fight, at the<br>van of battle, with the whole world consisting of gods, Asuras, and men,<br>risen up in arms. I will vanquish the assembled Parthas and the Somakas<br>in battle. Without doubt, I will become the leader of thy troops. I will<br>form such an array that our enemies will not be able to overmaster it. I<br>say this to thee, O Duryodhana. There is no doubt in this." Thus<br>addressed (by Shalya), king Duryodhana cheerfully poured sanctified<br>water, without losing any time, O best of the Bharatas, on the ruler of<br>the Madras, in the midst of his troops, according to the rites ordained<br>in the scriptures, O monarch. After Shalya had been invested with the<br>command, loud leonine roars arose among thy troops and diverse musical<br>instruments also, O Bharata, were beat and blown. The Kaurava warriors<br>became very cheerful, as also the mighty car-warriors among the Madrakas.<br>And all of them praised the royal Shalya, that ornament of battle,<br>saying, "Victory to thee, O king. Long life to thee! Slay all the<br>assembled foes! Having obtained the might of thy arms, let the<br>Dhartarashtras endued with great strength, rule the wide Earth without a<br>foe. Thou art capable of vanquishing in battle the three worlds<br>consisting of the gods, the Asuras, what need be said of the Somakas and<br>the Srinjayas that are mortal?" Thus praised, the mighty king of the<br>Madrakas obtained great joy that is unattainable by persons of unrefined<br>souls.<br><br>"'Shalya said, "Today, O king, I will either slay all the Pancalas with<br>the Pandavas in battle, or, slain by them, proceed to heaven. Let the<br>world behold me today careering (on the field of battle) fearlessly.<br>Today let all the sons of Pandu, and Vasudeva, and Satyaki, and the sons<br>of Draupadi, and Dhrishtadyumna, and Shikhandi, and all the Prabhadrakas,<br>behold my prowess and the great might of my bow, and my quickness, and<br>the energy of my weapons, and the strength of my arms, in battle. Let the<br>Parthas, and all the Siddhas, with the Charanas behold today the strength<br>that is in my arms and the wealth of weapons I possess. Beholding my<br>prowess today, let the mighty car-warriors of the Pandavas, desirous of<br>counteracting it, adopt diverse courses of action. Today I will rout the<br>troops of the Pandavas on all sides. Surpassing Drona and Bhishma and the<br>Suta's son, O lord, in battle, I will career on the field, O Kauravas,<br>for doing what is agreeable to thee."'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'After Shalya had been invested with the command, O<br>giver of honours, no one among thy troops, O bull of Bharata's race, any<br>longer felt any grief on account of Karna. Indeed, the troops became<br>cheerful and glad. They regarded the Parthas as already slain and brought<br>under the power of the ruler of the Madras. Having obtained great joy,<br>thy troops, O bull of Bharata's race, slept that night happily and became<br>very cheerful. Hearing those shouts of thy army, king Yudhishthira,<br>addressing him of Vrishni's race, said these words, in the hearing of all<br>the Kshatriyas, "The ruler of the Madras, Shalya, that great bowman who<br>is highly regarded by all the warriors hath, O Madhava, been made the<br>leader of his forces by Dhritarashtra's son. Knowing this that has<br>happened, do, O Madhava, that which is beneficial. Thou art our leader<br>and protector. Do that which should next be done." Then Vasudeva, O<br>monarch, said unto that king, "I know Artayani, O Bharata, truly. Endued<br>with prowess and great energy, he is highly illustrious. He is<br>accomplished, conversant with all the modes of warfare, and possessed of<br>great lightness of hand. I think that the ruler of the Madras is in<br>battle equal to Bhishma or Drona or Karna, or perhaps, superior to them.<br>I do not, O ruler of men, even upon reflection, find the warrior who may<br>be a match for Shalya while engaged in fight. In battle, he is superior<br>in might to Shikhandi and Arjuna and Bhima and Satyaki and<br>Dhrishtadyumna, O Bharata. The king of the Madras, O monarch, endued with<br>the prowess of a lion or an elephant, will career fearlessly in battle<br>like the Destroyer himself in wrath amongst creatures at the time of the<br>universal destruction. I do not behold a match for him in battle save<br>thee, O tiger among men, that art possessed of prowess equal to that of a<br>tiger. Save thee there is no other person in either heaven or the whole<br>of this world, who, O son of Kuru's race, would be able to slay the ruler<br>of the Madras while excited with wrath in battle. Day after day engaged<br>in fight, he agitates thy troops. For this, slay Shalya in battle, like<br>Maghavat slaying Samvara. Treated with honour by Dhritarashtra's son,<br>that hero is invincible in battle. Upon the fall of the ruler of the<br>Madras in battle, thou art certain to have victory. Upon his slaughter,<br>the vast Dhartarashtra host will be slain. Hearing, O monarch, these<br>words of mine now, proceed, O Partha, against that mighty car-warrior,<br>the ruler of the Madras. Slay that warrior, O thou of mighty arms, like<br>Vasava slaying the Asura Namuchi. There is no need of showing any<br>compassion here, thinking that this one is thy maternal uncle. Keeping<br>the duties of a Kshatriya before thee, slay the ruler of the Madras.<br>Having crossed the fathomless oceans represented by Bhishma and Drona and<br>Karna, do not sink, with thy followers, in the print of a cow's hoof<br>represented by Shalya. Display in battle the whole of thy ascetic power<br>and thy Kshatriya energy. Slay that car-warrior." Having said these<br>words, Keshava, that slayer of hostile heroes, proceeded to his tent in<br>the evening, worshipped by the Pandavas. After Keshava had gone, king<br>Yudhishthira the just, dismissing all his brothers and the Somakas,<br>happily slept that night, like an elephant from whose body the darts have<br>been plucked out. All those great bowmen of the Pancalas and Pandavas,<br>delighted in consequence of the fall of Karna, slept that night happily.<br>Its fever dispelled, the army of the Pandavas, abounding with great<br>bowmen and mighty car-warriors having reached the shore as it were,<br>became very happy that night, in consequence of the victory, O sire, it<br>had won by the slaughter of Karna.'"
