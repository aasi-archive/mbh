                            "Sanjaya said, 'Thy son, Chitrasena, O Bharata, resisted (Nakula's son)<br>Satanika who was engaged in scorching thy host with his keen shafts.<br>Nakula's son pierced Chitrasena with five arrows. The letter then pierced<br>the former in return with ten whetted shafts. And once more Chitrasena, O<br>monarch, in that battle, pierced Satanika in the chest with nine keen<br>shafts. Then the son of Nakula with many straight shafts cut Chitrasena's<br>armour from off his body. This feat of his seemed exceedingly wonderful.<br>Divested of his armour, thy son, O king, looked exceedingly beautiful,<br>like a snake, O monarch, having cast off his slough at the proper season.<br>Then Nakula's son, with many keen shafts, cut off the struggling<br>Chitrasena's standard, and then his bow, O monarch, in that encounter.<br>His bow cut off in that combat, and deprived also of his armour, that<br>mighty car-warrior, then, O king, took up another bow capable of piercing<br>every foe. Then Chitrasena, that mighty car-warrior amongst the<br>Bharata's, quickly pierced the son of Nakula with many straight arrows.<br>Then mighty Satanika, excited with rage, O Bharata, slew the four steeds<br>of Chitrasena and then his driver. The illustrious Chitrasena, endued<br>with great strength, jumping down from that car, afflicted the son of<br>Nakula with five and twenty arrows. Then Nakula's son with a<br>crescent-shaped arrow, cut off in that combat the gold-decked bow of<br>Chitrasena while the latter was engaged in thus striking him. Bowless and<br>carless and steedless and driverless, Chitrasena then quickly ascended<br>the car of the illustrious son Hridika.<br><br>"Vrishasena, O king, rushed with great speed, scattering shafts in<br>hundreds, against the mighty car-warrior Drupada, advancing at the head<br>of his troops against Drona.[224] Yajnasena, in that encounter pierced<br>that mighty car-warrior, viz., the son of Karna in the arms and the<br>chest, O lord, with sixty arrows. Vrishasena, then, excited with rage,<br>quickly pierced Yajnasena, standing on his car, with many shafts in the<br>centre of the chest. Those two warriors mangled by arrows, and with<br>shafts sticking to their bodies, looked beautiful like a couple of<br>porcupines with their quills erect. Bathed in blood in consequence of the<br>wounds caused by those straight arrows of keen points and golden wings,<br>they looked exceedingly beautiful in that dreadful encounter. Indeed, the<br>spectacle they presented was that of a couple of beautiful and radiant<br>Kalpa trees or of a couple of Kinsukas rich with their flowery burthens.<br>Then Vrishasena, O king, having pierced Drupada with nine arrows, once<br>more pierced him with seventy, and then again with three other arrows.<br>Then shooting thousands of arrows, Karna's son, O monarch, looked<br>beautiful in that battle, like a cloud pouring torrents of rain. Then<br>Drupada, inflamed with wrath, cut off Vrishasena's bow into two<br>fragments, with a broad-headed arrow, sharp and well-tempered. Taking,<br>then, another gold-decked bow that was new and strong, and drawing out of<br>his quiver a strong, whetted, well-tempered, sharp and broad-headed<br>arrow, and fixing it on his string, and carefully aiming it-at Drupada,<br>he let it off with great force, inspiring all the Somakas with fear. That<br>arrow, piercing through the breast of Drupada, fell on the surface of the<br>earth. The king (of the Panchalas), then, thus pierced through with<br>Vrishasena's arrow, swooned away. His driver, then, recollecting his own<br>duty, bore him away from the field. After the retreat, O monarch, of that<br>mighty car-warrior of the Panchalas, the (Kaurava) army, on that terrible<br>night, rushed furiously against Drupada's troops whose coats of mail had<br>been cut off by means of the arrows of the foe. In consequence of the<br>blazing lamps dropped by the combatants all around, the earth, O king,<br>looked beautiful like the cloudless firmament bespangled with planets and<br>stars. With the fallen Angadas of the combatants, the earth looked<br>resplendent, O king, like a mass of clouds in the rainy season with<br>flashes of lightning. Afflicted with the fear of Karna's son, the<br>Panchalas fled away on all sides, like the Danavas from fear of Indra in<br>the great battle of yore between the gods and the Asuras. Thus afflicted<br>in battle by Vrishasena, the Panchalas and the Somakas, O monarch,<br>illumined by lamps, looked exceedingly beautiful.[225] Having vanquished<br>them in battle, Karna's son looked beautiful like the son, O Bharata,<br>when he reaches the meridian. Amongst all those thousands of kings of thy<br>side and their the valiant Vrishasena then seemed to be the only<br>resplendent luminary. Having defeated in battle many heroes and all the<br>mighty car-warriors among the Somakas, he quickly proceeded, O king, to<br>the spot where king Yudhishthira was stationed.<br><br>"Thy son Duhsasana proceeded against that mighty car-warrior, viz.,<br>Prativindhya, who was advancing (against Drona), scorching his foes in<br>battle. The encounter that took place between them, O king, looked<br>beautiful, like that of Mercury and Venus in the cloudless firmament.<br>Duhsasana pierced Prativindhya, who was accomplishing fierce feats in<br>battle, with three arrows on the forehead. Deeply pierced by that mighty<br>bowman, thy son, Prativindhya, O monarch, looked beautiful like a crested<br>hill. The mighty car-warrior Prativindhya, then, piercing Duhsasana with<br>three arrows, once more pierced him with seven, Thy son, then, O Bharata,<br>achieved there an exceedingly difficult feat, for he felled<br>Prativindhya's steeds with many arrows. With another broad-headed arrow<br>he also felled the latter's driver, and then his standard. And then he<br>cut off, O king, into a thousand fragments the car of Prativindhya, armed<br>with the bow. Excited with rage, O lord, thy son also cut off, with his<br>straight shafts, into numberless fragments the banner, the quivers, the<br>strings, and the traces (of his antagonist's car). Deprived of his car,<br>the virtuous Prativindhya stood, bow in hand, and contended with thy son<br>scattering numberless arrows. Then Duhsasana, displaying great lightness<br>of hand, cut off Prativindhya's bow. And then he afflicted his bowless<br>antagonist with ten shafts. Beholding their brother, (Prativindhya) in<br>that plight, his brothers, all mighty car-warriors, rushed impetuously to<br>that spot with a large force. He then ascended the resplendent of<br>Sutasoma. Taking up another bow, he continued, O king, to pierce thy son.<br>Then many warriors on thy side, accompanied by a large force, rushed<br>impetuously and surrounded thy son (for rescuing him). Then commenced a<br>fierce battle between thy troops and theirs, O Bharata, at that dreadful<br>hour of midnight, increasing the population of Yama's kingdom.'"
