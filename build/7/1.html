                            (Dronabhisheka Parva)<br><br>OM! HAVING BOWED down unto Narayan, and unto that most exalted of male<br>beings, viz., Nara, and unto the goddess Saraswati also, must the word<br>Jaya be uttered.<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'Hearing that his sire Devavrata of unrivalled vigour<br>and sturdiness, and might, energy and prowess, had been slain by<br>Sikhandin, the prince of the Panchalas, what, indeed, O regenerate Rishi,<br>did the powerful king Dhritarashtra with eyes bathed in tears do? O<br>illustrious one, his son (Duryodhana) wished for sovereignty after<br>vanquishing those mighty bowmen, viz., the sons of Panda, through Bhishma<br>and Drona and other great car-warriors. Tell me, O thou that hast wealth<br>of asceticism, all that he, of Kura's race, did after that chief of all<br>bowmen had been slain.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing that his sire had been slain, king<br>Dhritarashtra of Kura's race filled with anxiety and grief, obtained no<br>peace of mind. And while he, of Kura's race, was thus continually<br>brooding over that sorrow, Gavalgana's son of pure soul once more came to<br>him. Then, O monarch, Dhritarashtra, the son of Amvika, addressed<br>Sanjaya, who had that night come back from the camp to the city called<br>after the elephant. With a heart rendered exceedingly cheerless in<br>consequence of his having heard of Bhishma's fall, and desirous of the<br>victory of his sons, he indulged in these lamentations in great distress.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'After having wept for the high-souled Bhishma of<br>terrible prowess, what, O son, did the Kauravas, urged by fate, next do?<br>Indeed, when that high-souled and invincible hero was slain, what did the<br>Kauravas do, sunk as they were in an ocean of grief? Indeed, that<br>swelling and highly efficient host of the high-souled Pandavas, would, O<br>Sanjaya, excite the keenest fears of even the three worlds. Tell me,<br>therefore, O Sanjaya, what the (assembled) kings did after Devavrata,<br>that bull of Kura's race, had fallen.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Listen, O king, with undivided attention, to me as I<br>recite what thy sons did after Devavrata had been killed in battle. When<br>Bhishma, O monarch, of prowess incapable of being baffled, was slain, thy<br>warriors as also the Pandavas both reflected by themselves (on the<br>situation). Reflecting on the duties of the Kshatriya order, they were<br>filled with wonder and joy; but acting according to those duties of their<br>own order, they all bowed to that high-souled warrior. Then those tigers<br>among men contrived for Bhishma of immeasurable prowess a bed with a<br>pillow made of straight shafts. And having made arrangements for<br>Bhishma's protection, they addressed one another (in pleasant converse).<br>Then bidding Ganga's son their farewell and walking round him, and<br>looking at one another with eyes red in anger, those Kshatriyas, urged by<br>fate, once more went out against one another for battle. Then by the<br>blare of trumpets and the beat of drums, the divisions of thy army as<br>also those of the foe, marched out. After the fall of Ganga's son, O<br>king, when the best part of the day had passed away, yielding to the<br>influence of wrath, with hearts afflicted by fate, and disregarding the<br>words, worthy of acceptance, of the high-souled Bhishma, those foremost<br>ones of Bharata's race went out with great speed, armed with weapons. In<br>consequence of thy folly and of thy son's and of the slaughter of<br>Santanu's son, the Kauravas with all the kings seemed to be summoned by<br>Death himself. The Kurus, deprived of Devavrata, were filled with great<br>anxiety, and resembled a herd of goats and sheep without a herdsman, in a<br>forest abounding with beasts of prey. Indeed, after the fall of that<br>foremost one of Bharata's race, the Kuru host looked like the firmament<br>divested of stars, or like the sky without the atmosphere, or like the<br>earth with blasted crops, or like an oration disfigured by bad<br>grammar,[1] or like the Asura host of old after Vali had been smitten<br>down, or like a beautiful damsel deprived of husband,[2] or like a river<br>whose waters have been dried up, or like a roe deprived of her mate and<br>encompassed in the woods by wolves; or like a spacious mountain cave with<br>its lion killed by a Sarabha.[3] Indeed, O chief of the Bharatas, the<br>Bharata host, on the fall of Ganga's son, became like a frail boat on the<br>bosom of the ocean, tossed by a tempest blowing from every side.<br>Exceedingly afflicted by the mighty and heroic Pandavas of sure aim, the<br>Kaurava host, with its steeds, car-warriors and elephants much troubled,<br>became exceedingly distressed, helpless, and panic-stricken. And the<br>frightened kings and the common soldiers, no longer relying upon one<br>another, of that army, deprived of Devavrata, seemed to sink into the<br>nethermost region of the world. Then the Kauravas remembered Karna, who<br>indeed, was equal to Devavrata himself. All hearts turned to that<br>foremost of all wielders of arms, that one resembling a guest resplendent<br>(with learning and ascetic austerities). And all hearts turned to him, as<br>the heart of a man in distress turneth to a friend capable of relieving<br>that distress. And, O Bharata, the kings then cried out saying, Karna!<br>Karna! The son of Radha, our friend, the son of a Suta, that one who is<br>ever prepared to lay down his life in battle! Endued with great fame,<br>Karna, with his followers and friends, did not fight for these ten days.<br>O, summon him soon!' The mighty-armed hero, in the presence of all the<br>Kshatriyas, during the mention of valiant and mighty car-warriors, was by<br>Bhishma classed as an Ardha-ratha, although that bull among men is equal<br>to two Maharathas! Even thus was he classed during the counting of Rathas<br>and Atirathas, he that is the foremost (of all Rathas and Atirathas), he<br>that is respected by all heroes, he that would venture to fight even with<br>Yama, Kuvera, Varuna, and Indra. Through anger caused by this, O king, he<br>had said unto Ganga's son these words: 'As long as thou livest, O thou of<br>Kuru's race, I will never fight! if thou, however, succeedest in slaying<br>the sons of Pandu in great battle, I shall, O Kaurava, with Duryodhana's<br>permission, retire into the woods. If, on the other hand, thou, O<br>Bhishma, slain by the Pandavas, attainest to heaven, I shall then, on a<br>single car, slay all of them, whom thou regardest as great car-warriors.'<br>Having said this, mighty-armed Karna of great fame, with thy son's<br>approval, did not fight for the first ten days. Bhishma, of great prowess<br>in battle and of immeasurable might, slew, O Bharata, a very large number<br>of warriors belonging to Yudhishthira's army. When, however, that hero of<br>sure aim and great energy was slain, thy sons thought of Karna, like<br>persons desirous of crossing a river thinking, of a boat. Thy warriors<br>and thy sons, together with all the kings, cried out, saying, Karna! And<br>they all said, 'Even this is the time for the display of his prowess.'<br>Our hearts are turned to that Karna who derived his knowledge of weapons<br>from Jamadagni's son, and whose prowess is incapable of being resisted!<br>He, indeed, O king, is competent to save us from great dangers, like<br>Govinda always saving the celestials from great dangers.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Unto Sanjaya who was thus repeatedly applauding<br>Karna, Dhritarashtra sighing like a snake, said those words.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, '[I understand] that the hearts of all of you are<br>turned towards Vikartana's son Karna, and that all of you, saw that son<br>of Radha, that hero of the Suta caste, ever prepared to lay down his life<br>in battle. I hope that hero of prowess incapable of being baffled, did<br>not falsify the expectations of Duryodhana and his brothers, all of whom<br>were then afflicted with grief and fear, and desirous of being relieved<br>from their danger. When Bhishma, that refuge of Kauravas, was slain,<br>could Karna, that foremost of bowmen, succeed in filling up the gap<br>caused? Filling up that gap, could Karna fill the foe with fear? Could he<br>also crown with fruit the hopes, entertained by my sons, of victory?'"
