                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Were there, O Sanjaya, no mighty car-warriors in<br>that army of mine who could slay or resist that Satyaki while he<br>proceeded (towards Arjuna)? Of prowess incapable of being baffled, and<br>endued with might equal to that of Sakra himself, alone he achieved feats<br>in battle like the great Indra amidst the Danavas! Or, perhaps, the track<br>by which Satyaki proceeded was empty? Alas, possessed of true prowess,<br>alone he hath crushed numberless warriors! Tell me, O Sanjaya, how the<br>grandson of Sini, alone as he was, passed through that vast force<br>struggling with him in battle?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'O king, the fierce exertions and the uproar made by thy<br>host which abounded with cars and elephants and steeds and foot-soldiers,<br>resembled what is seen at the end of the yuga. O giver of honours, when<br>thy assembled host was (daily) mustered, it seemed to me that another<br>assemblage like that of thy army had never been on earth. The gods and<br>the Charanas, who came there said, 'This muster will be the last of its<br>kind on earth.' Indeed, O king, never had such an array been formed<br>before as that which was formed by Drona on the day of Jayadratha's<br>slaughter. The uproar made by those vast bodies of soldiers rushing at<br>one another in battle resembled that of the ocean itself lashed into fury<br>by the tempest. In that host of thine, as also in that of the Pandavas,<br>there were hundreds and thousands of kings, O best of men. The noise made<br>by those angry heroes of fierce deeds while engaged in battle was<br>tremendous and made the hair-stand on end. Then Bhimasena and<br>Dhrishtadyumna, O sire, and Nakula and Sahadeva and king Yudhishthira the<br>Just, loudly shouted, 'Come, Strike, Rush! The brave Madhava and Arjuna<br>have entered the hostile army! Do that quickly by which they may easily<br>go to where Jayadratha's car is.' Saying this, they urged their soldiers.<br>And they continued, 'If Satyaki and Arjuna be slain, Kurus will have<br>achieved their objects, and ourselves shall be defeated. All of you,<br>therefore, uniting together, quickly agitate this ocean-like army (of the<br>foe) like impetuous winds agitating the deep.' The warriors, O king, thus<br>urged by Bhimasena and the prince of the Panchalas, smothered the<br>Kauravas, becoming reckless of their very lives. Endued with great<br>energy, all of them, desiring death in battle, at the point or the edge<br>of weapons in expectation of heaven, showed not the least regard for<br>their lives in fighting for their friends. Similarly, thy warriors, O<br>king, desirous of great renown, and nobly resolved upon battle, stood on<br>the field, determined to fight. In that fierce and terrible battle,<br>Satyaki having vanquished all the combatants proceeded towards Arjuna.<br>The rays of the sun being reflected from the bright armour of the<br>warriors, the combatants were obliged to withdraw their eyes from those.<br>Duryodhana also, O king, penetrated the mighty host of the high-souled<br>Pandavas vigorously struggling in battle. The encounter that took place<br>between him on the one side and them on the other, was exceedingly<br>fierce, and great was the carnage that occurred there on the occasion.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'When the Pandava host was thus proceeding to<br>battle, Duryodhana, in penetrating it, must have been placed in great<br>distress. I hope, he did not turn his back upon the field, O Suta! That<br>encounter between one and the many in dreadful battle, the one, again,<br>being a king, seems to me to have been very unequal. Besides, Duryodhana<br>hath been brought up in great luxury, in wealth and possessions, he is a<br>king of men. Alone encountering many, I hope he did not turn back from<br>fight.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Listen to me, O king, as I describe, O Bharata, that<br>wonderful battle fought by thy son, that encounter between one and the<br>many. Indeed, the Pandava army was agitated by Duryodhana in that battle,<br>like an assemblage of lotus-stalks in a lake by an elephant. Seeing then<br>that army thus smitten by thy son, O king, the Panchalas headed by<br>Bhimasena rushed at them. Then Duryodhana pierced Bhimasena with ten<br>arrows and each of the twins with three and king Yudhishthira with seven.<br>And he pierced Virata and Drupada with six arrows, and Sikhandin with a<br>hundred. And piercing Dhrishtadyumna with twenty arrows, he struck each<br>of the five sons of Draupadi with three arrows. With his fierce shafts he<br>cut off hundreds of other combatants in that battle, including elephants<br>and car-warriors, like the Destroyer himself in wrath exterminating<br>creatures. In consequence of his skill cultured by practice and of the<br>power of his weapons, he seemed, as he was engaged in striking down his<br>foes, to bend his bow incessantly drawn to a circle whether when aiming<br>or letting off his shafts. Indeed, that formidable bow of his, the back<br>of whose staff was decked with gold, was seen by people to be drawn into<br>a perpetual circle as he was employed in slaying his enemies. Then king<br>Yudhishthira, with a couple of broad-headed shafts, cut off the bow of<br>thy son, O thou of Kuru's race, as the latter struggled in fight. And<br>Yudhishthira also pierced him deeply with ten excellent and foremost of<br>shafts. Those arrows, however, touching the armour of Duryodhana, quickly<br>broke into pieces. Then the Parthas, filled with delight surrounded<br>Yudhishthira, like the celestials and great Rishis in days of old<br>surrounding Sakra on the occasion of the slaughter of Vritra. Thy valiant<br>son then, taking up another bow, addressed king Yudhishthira, the son of<br>Pandu, saying, 'Wait, Wait,' and rushed against him. Beholding thy son<br>thus advancing in great battle, the Panchalas, cheerfully and with hopes<br>of victory, advanced to receive him. Then Drona, desirous of rescuing the<br>(Kuru) king, received the rushing Panchalas, like a mountain receiving<br>masses of rain-charged clouds driven by tempest. The battle then, O king,<br>that took place there was exceedingly fierce, making the hair stand on<br>end, between the Pandavas, O thou of mighty arms, and thy warriors.<br>Dreadful was the carnage of all creatures that then took place,<br>resembling the sport of Rudra himself (at the end of the Yuga). Then<br>there arose a loud uproar at the place where Dhananjaya was. And that<br>uproar, O lord, making the hair stand on end, rose above all other<br>sounds. Thus, O mighty-armed one, progressed the battle between Arjuna<br>and thy bowmen. Thus progressed the battle between Satyaki and thy men in<br>the midst of thy army. And thus continued the fight between Drona and his<br>enemies at the gate of the array. Thus, indeed, O lord of the earth,<br>continued that carnage on the earth, when Arjuna and Drona and the mighty<br>car-warrior Satyaki were all excited with wrath.'"
