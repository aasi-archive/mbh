                            "Narada said, 'Nabhaga's son, Amvarisha, O Srinjaya, we hear, fell a prey<br>to death. Alone he battled a thousand times with a thousand kings.<br>Desirous of victory, those foes, accomplished in weapons, rushed against<br>him in battle from all sides, uttering fierce exclamations. Aided by his<br>strength and activity and the skill he had acquired by practice, he cut<br>off, by the force of his weapons, the umbrellas, the weapons, the<br>standards, the cars, and the lances of those enemies, and dispelled his<br>anxieties.[105] Desirous of saving their lives, those men, doffing their<br>coats of mail, implored him (for mercy). They sought his protection,<br>saying, 'We yield ourselves to thee.' Reducing them to subjection and<br>conquering the whole earth, he performed a hundred sacrifices of the best<br>kind, according to the rites ordained in the scriptures, O sinless one!<br>Food possessed of every agreeable quality was eaten (at those sacrifices)<br>by large classes of people. At those sacrifices, the Brahmanas were<br>respectfully worshipped and greatly gratified. And the regenerate classes<br>ate sweet-meats, and Purikas and Puras, and Apupas and Sashkalis of good<br>taste and large size, and Karambhas and Prithumridwikas, and diverse<br>kinds of dainties, and various kinds of soup, and Maireyaka, and<br>Ragakhandavas, and diverse kinds of confectionary, well-prepared, soft,<br>and of excellent fragrance, and clarified butter, and honey, and milk,<br>and water, and sweet curds, and many kinds of fruits and roots agreeable<br>to the taste.[106] And they that were habituated to wine drank in due<br>time diverse kinds of intoxicating drinks for the sake of the pleasure<br>that those produced, and sang and played upon their musical instruments.<br>Avid others, by thousands, intoxicated with what they drank, danced and<br>merrily sang hymns to the praise of Amvarisha; while others, unable to<br>keep themselves erect, fell down on the earth. In those sacrifices, king<br>Amvarisha gave, as sacrificial presents, the kingdoms of hundreds and<br>thousands of kings unto the ten million priests (employed by him) Having<br>performed diverse sacrifices the king gave unto the Brahmanas, as<br>sacrificial presents, numbers of princes and kings whose coronal locks<br>had undergone the sacred bath, all cased in golden coats of mail, all<br>having white umbrellas spread over their heads, all seated on golden<br>cars, all attired in excellent robes and having large trains of<br>followers, and all bearing their sceptres, and in possession of their<br>treasuries. The great Rishis, seeing what he did, were highly gratified,<br>and said, 'None amongst men in past times did, none in future will be<br>able to do, what king Amvarisha of profuse liberality, is doing now. When<br>he, O Srinjaya, died who was superior to thee in respect of the four<br>cardinal virtues and who superior to thee, was, much more superior to thy<br>son, thou shouldst not, therefore, saying, 'Oh, Swaitya, Oh, Swaitya',<br>grieve for the latter who performed no sacrifice and made no sacrificial<br>present.'"
