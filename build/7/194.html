                            "Sanjaya said, 'Upon the fall of Drona, O king, the Kurus, afflicted with<br>weapons, deprived of their leader, broken and routed, became filled with<br>exertion, and deprived of energy through grief. Uttering loud wails, they<br>grief, Seeing their foes (the Pandavas) prevailing over them, they<br>repeatedly trembled. Their eyes filled with tears, and hearts inspired<br>with fear, they became, O king, melancholy an cheerless, and destitute of<br>gathered round thy son. Covered with dust, trembling (with fear), casting<br>vacant looks on all sides, and their voice choked with fear, they<br>resembled the Daityas after the fall of Hiranyaksha in the days of yore.<br>Surrounded by them all, as if by small animals struck with fear, thy son,<br>unable to stay in their midst, moved away. Afflicted with hunger and<br>thirst, and scorched by the sun, thy warriors, then, O Bharata, became<br>exceedingly cheerless. Beholding the fall of Bharadwaja's son, which was<br>like unto the dropping of the sun down upon the earth, or the drying up<br>of the ocean, or the transplantation of Meru, or the defeat of Vasava,<br>beholding that act, incapable of being quietly witnessed, the Kauravas, O<br>king, fled away in fear,&#8212;terror lending them greater speed. The ruler of<br>the Gandharas Sakuni, beholding Drona of the golden car slain, fled with<br>the car-warriors of his division, with speed that was much greater. Even<br>the Suta's son fled away in fear, taking with him his own vast division,<br>that was retreating with great speed with all its standards. The ruler of<br>the Madras, viz., Salya, also, casting vacant looks around, fled away in<br>fear, taking with him his division, teeming with cars and elephants and<br>steeds. Saradwat's son, Kripa, too, fled away, saying, 'Alas. Alas,'<br>taking with him his division of elephants and foot-soldiers, the greater<br>part thereof having been slain. Kritavarman, O king, also fled away,<br>borne by his swift steeds, and surrounded by the remnant of his Bhoja,<br>Kalinga, Aratta, and Valhika troops. Uluka, O king, beholding Drona<br>slain, fled away with speed, afflicted with fear and accompanied by a<br>large body of foot-soldiers. Handsome and endued with youth, and reputed<br>for his bravery, Duhsasana, also, in great anxiety, fled away surrounded<br>by his elephant division. Taking with him ten thousand cars and three<br>thousand elephants, Vrishasena also fled with speed at the sight of<br>Drona's fall. Accompanied by his elephants and horses and cars, and<br>surrounded also by foot-soldiers, thy son, the mighty car-warrior,<br>Duryodhana, too, fled away, O king, taking with him the remnant of the<br>Samsaptakas whom Arjuna had not yet slaughtered. Susarman, O king, fled<br>away, beholding Drona slain. Riding on elephants and cars and steeds, all<br>the warriors of the Kaurava army fled away from the field, seeing Drona,<br>of golden car, slain. Some urging their sires on, some their brothers,<br>some their maternal uncles, some their sons, some their friends, the<br>Kauravas fled away. Others urging on their brethren in arms or, their<br>sisters' sons, their kinsmen, fled away on all sides. With dishevelled<br>hair, and accoutrements loosened, all fled away in such a manner that<br>even two persons could not be seen running together.&#8212;The Kuru army has<br>been totally destroyed,&#8212;even this was the belief of every body. Others<br>amongst thy troops, fled away, O king, throwing off their coats of mail.<br>The soldiers loudly called upon one another, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>saying,&#8212;'Wait, Wait, do not fly,' but none of them that said so<br>themselves stood on the field. Abandoning their vehicles and cars decked<br>with ornaments, the warriors, riding on steeds or using their legs, fled<br>away with great speed.<br><br>"While the troops, deprived of energy, were thus flying away with speed,<br>only Drona's son, Aswatthaman, like a huge alligator coming up against<br>the current of a stream, rushed against his foes. A fierce battle took<br>place between him and many warriors headed by Sikhandin and the<br>Prabhadrakas, the Panchalas, the Chedis, and the Kaikeyas. Slaying many<br>warriors of the Pandava army that were incapable of being defeated with<br>ease, and escaping with difficulty from the press of battle, that hero,<br>possessed of the tread of an infuriated elephant, saw the (Kaurava) host<br>running away, resolved on flight. Proceeding towards Duryodhana, Drona's<br>son, approaching the Kuru king, said, 'Why, O Bharata, are the troops<br>flying away as if in fear? Although flying away, thus, O monarch, why<br>dost thou not yet rally them in battle? Thyself, too, O king, dost not<br>seem to be in thy usual frame of mind. Upon the slaughter of that lion<br>among car-warriors, O monarch, hath thy force fallen into this plight. O<br>Kaurava, O king, all these that are headed (even) by Karna, wait not on<br>the field. In no battle fought before did the army fly away thus. Hath<br>any evil befallen thy troops, O Bharata?' Hearing these words of Drona's<br>son on that occasion, Duryodhana, that bull among kings, felt himself<br>unable to impart the bitter intelligence. Indeed, thy son seemed to sink<br>into an ocean of grief, like a foundered boat. Beholding Drona's son on<br>his car, the king became bathed in tears. Suffused with shame, O monarch,<br>the king then addressed Saradwat's son, saying, 'Blessed be thou, say<br>thou, before others, why the army is thus flying away'. Then Saradwat's<br>son, O king, repeatedly feeling great anguish, told Drona's son how his<br>sire had been slain.'<br><br>"Kripa said, 'Placing Drona, that foremost of car-warriors, at our head,<br>we commenced to fight with only the Panchalas. When the battle commenced,<br>the Kurus and the Somakas, mingled together, roared at one another and<br>began to strike down one another with their weapons. During the progress<br>of that battle the Dhartarashtras began to be thinned. Seeing this, thy<br>sire, filled with rage, invoked into existence a celestial weapon.<br>Indeed, Drona, that bull among men, having invoked the Brahma weapon,<br>slew his enemies with broad-headed arrows, by hundreds, and<br>thousands.[256] Urged by fate, the Pandavas, the Kaikeyas, the Matsyas,<br>and the Panchalas, O foremast of regenerate ones, approaching Drona's<br>car, began to perish. With his Brahma weapon, Drona despatched unto<br>Yama's abode a thousand brave warriors and two thousand elephants. Of a<br>dark complexion, with his gray locks hanging down to his ears, and full<br>five and eighty years old, the aged Drona used to careen in battle like a<br>youth of sixteen, When the enemy's troops were thus afflicted and the<br>kings were being slain, the Panchalas, though filled with desire of<br>revenge, turned back from the fight. When the enemy, turning back,<br>partially lost their order, that vanquisher of foes, (viz., Drona),<br>invoking celestial weapons into the existence, shone resplendent like the<br>risen sun. Indeed, thy valiant sire, getting into the midst of the<br>Pandavas, and having arrows for the rays that emanated from him,<br>resembled the midday sun at whom none could gaze. Scorched by Drona, as<br>if by the blazing sun, they became cheerless and deprived of their energy<br>and senses. Beholding them thus afflicted by Drona with his shafts, the<br>slayer of Madhu, desirous of victory to the son of Pandu, said these<br>words: 'Truly, this foremost of all wielders of arms, this leader of the<br>leaders is incapable of being vanquished in battle by the slayer of<br>Vritra himself. Ye sons of Pandu, laying aside righteousness, take care<br>of victory, so that Drona of the golden car may not slay all of you in<br>battle. I think he will not fight after the fall of Aswatthaman. Let some<br>man falsely tell him that Aswatthaman has been slain in battle.' Hearing<br>these words Kunti's son, Dhananjaya, approved them not. The advice,<br>however, met with the approval of all others, and even of Yudhishthira<br>with some difficulty. Then, Bhimasena, with a tinge of bashfulness, said<br>unto thy sire, 'Aswatthaman hath been slain.' Thy sire, however, did not<br>believe him. Suspecting the intelligence to be false, thy father, so<br>affectionate towards thee, enquired of Yudhishthira as to whether thou<br>wert really dead or not. Afflicted with the fear of a lie, solicitous at<br>the same time of victory, Yudhishthira, beholding a mighty elephant, huge<br>as a hill and called Aswatthaman, belonging to the Malava chief,<br>Indravarman, slain on the field by Bhima, approached Drona and answered<br>him, saying, 'He for whom thou wieldest weapons, he, looking upon whom<br>thou livest that ever dear son of thine, viz., Aswatthaman, hath been<br>slain, Deprived of life he lieth on the bare ground like a young lion.'<br>Aware fully of the evil consequences of falsehood, the king spoke those<br>words unto that best of Brahmans, indistinctly adding elephant (after<br>Aswatthaman). Hearing of the fall of his son, he began to wail aloud,<br>afflicted with grief, Restraining (the force of) his celestial weapons,<br>he fought not as before. Beholding him filled with anxiety, and almost<br>deprived of his senses by grief, the son of the Panchala king, of cruel<br>deeds, rushed towards him. Seeing the prince who had been ordained as his<br>slayer, Drona, verse in all truths about men and things, abandoned all<br>his celestial weapons and sat in Praya on the field of battle. Then<br>Prishata's son, seizing Drona's head with his left hand and disregarding<br>the loud admonitions of all the heroes, cut off that head.' Drona should<br>not be slain, even these were the words uttered from every side.<br>Similarly, Arjuna also, jumping down from his car, quickly ran towards<br>Prishata's son, with arms upraised and repeatedly saying, 'O thou that<br>art acquainted with the ways of morality, do not slay the preceptor but<br>bring him alive.' Though thus forbidden by the Kauravas as also by<br>Arjuna, Dhrishtadyumna killed thy father. For this, afflicted with fear,<br>the troops are all flying away. Ourselves also, for the same reason, in<br>great cheerlessness, O sinless one, are doing the same.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing of the slaughter of his sire in battle,<br>Drona's son, like a snake struck with the foot, became filled with fierce<br>wrath. And filled with rage, O sire, Aswatthaman blazed up in that battle<br>like a fire fed with a large quantity of fuel. As he squeezed his hands<br>and ground his teeth, and breathed like a snake, his eyes became red as<br>blood.'"
