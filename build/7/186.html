                            "Sanjaya said, 'When three-fourths of that night had worn away, the<br>battle, O king, once more commenced between the Kurus and the Pandavas.<br>Both sides were elated with joy. Soon after, Aruna, the charioteer of<br>Surya, weakening the splendour of the moon, appeared, causing the welkin<br>to assume a coppery hue. The east was soon reddened with the red rays of<br>the sun that resembled a circular plate of gold. Then all the warriors of<br>the Kuru and the Pandava hosts, alighting from cars and steeds and<br>vehicles borne by men, stood, with joined hands, facing the sun, and<br>uttered the prayers of the twilight of dawn. The Kuru army having been<br>divided into two bodies, Drona, with Duryodhana before him, proceeded<br>(with one of those divisions) against the Somakas, the Pandavas, and the<br>Panchalas. Beholding the Kuru host divided into two bodies, Madhava<br>addressed Arjuna and said, 'Keeping thy foes to thy left, place this<br>division (commanded by Drona) to thy right. Obedient to the counsels of<br>Madhava in respect of the Kurus, Dhananjaya moved to the left of those<br>two mighty bowmen, viz., Drona, and Karna. Understanding the intentions<br>of Krishna, that subjugator of hostile cities, viz., Bhimasena,<br>addressing Partha who was then staying at the van of battle, said these<br>words.<br><br>"Bhimasena said, 'O Arjuna, O Vibhatsu, listen to these words of mine.<br>The time for that object for which Kshatriya ladies bring forth sons has<br>now come. If at such a time thou dost not strive to win prosperity, thou<br>shalt then act meanly like a veritable wretch. Putting forth thy prowess,<br>pay the debt thou owest to Truth, Prosperity, Virtue, and Fame! O<br>foremost of warriors, pierce this division, and keep these to thy right.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus urged by Bhima and Kesava, Savyasachin<br>prevailing over Drona and Karna, began to resist the foe all round. Many<br>foremost of Kshatriyas (among the Kurus), putting forth all their<br>prowess, failed to withstand Arjuna who advanced at the very van of his<br>troops, and who, like a raging conflagration, was consuming the foremost<br>ones among his foes. Then Duryodhana and Karna, and Sakuni, the son of<br>Suvala, covered Kunti's son, Dhananjaya, with showers of shafts. Baffling<br>the weapons of all those warriors, that foremost of all persons<br>well-skilled in weapons, O monarch, covered them (in return) with his<br>shafts. Aiming at their weapons with his (and thus baffling them all),<br>Arjuna, endued with great lightness of hand and possessing a complete<br>control over his senses, pierced every one of those warriors with ten<br>keen-pointed shafts. The welkin was then covered with dust. Thick showers<br>of arrows fell. Darkness set in, and a loud and terrible uproar arose.<br>When such was the state of things, neither the welkin, nor the earth, nor<br>the points of the compass, could any longer be seen. Stupefied by the<br>dust, all the troops became blind. Neither the foe, O king, nor we, could<br>distinguish each other. For this reason, the kings began to fight, guided<br>by conjecture and the names they uttered. Deprived of their cars,<br>car-warriors, O king, encountering one another, lost all order and became<br>a tangled mass. Their steeds killed and drivers slain, many of them,<br>becoming inactive, preserved their lives and looked exceedingly<br>affrighted. Slain steeds with riders deprived of lives were seen to lie<br>on slain elephants as if stretched on mountain-breasts. Then Drona,<br>moving away from that battle towards the north took up his station<br>there., and seemed to resemble a smokeless fire. Beholding him move away<br>from the battle towards the north, the Pandava troops, O king, began to<br>tremble. Indeed, beholding Drona resplendent and handsome and blazing<br>with energy, the enemy, inspired with fright became pale and wavered on<br>the field, O Bharata! While summoning the hostile army to battle, and<br>looking like an elephant in rut, the enemy became perfectly hopeless of<br>vanquishing him, like the Danavas hopeless of vanquishing Vasava. Some<br>among them became perfectly cheerless, and some, endued with energy,<br>became inspired with wrath. And some were filled with wonder, and some<br>became incapable of brooking (the challenge). And some of the kings<br>squeezed their hands, and some deprived of their senses by rage, bit<br>their lips. And some whirled their weapons, and some rubbed their arms;<br>and some, possessed of great energy and souls under complete control,<br>rushed against Drona. The Panchalas particularly, afflicted with the<br>shafts of Drona, O monarch, though suffering great pain, continued to<br>contend in battle.[247] Then Drupada and Virata proceeded, in that<br>battle, against Drona, that invincible warrior, who was thus careering on<br>the field. Then, O king, the three grandsons of Drupada, and those mighty<br>bowmen, viz., the Chedis, also proceeded against Drona in that encounter.<br>Drona, with three sharp shafts, took the lives of the three grandsons of<br>Drupada. Deprived of lives, the princes fell down on the earth. Drona<br>next vanquished in that battle the Chedis, the Kaikeyas, and the<br>Srinjayas. That mighty car-warrior, viz., the son of Bharadwaja, then<br>vanquished all Matsyas. Then Drupada, filled with wrath, and Virata, in<br>that battle, shot showers of shafts, O king, at Drona. Baffling that<br>arrowy shower, Drona, that grinder of Kshatriyas, covered both Drupada<br>and Virata with his shafts. Shrouded by Drona, both those warriors, with<br>rage, began to pierce him on the field of battle with their arrows. Then<br>Drona, O monarch, filled with wrath and desire of revenge, cut off, with<br>a couple of broad-headed shafts, the bows of both his antagonists. Then<br>Virata, filled with wrath, sped in that encounter ten lances and ten<br>shafts at Drona from desire of slaying him. And Drupada, in anger, hurled<br>at Drona's car a terrible dart made of iron and decked with gold and<br>resembling a large snake. Drona cut off, with a number of sharp and<br>broad-headed arrows, those ten lances (of Virata), and with certain other<br>shafts that dart (of Drupada) decked with gold and stones of lapis<br>lazuli. Then that grinder of foes, viz., the son of Bharadwaja, with a<br>couple of well-tempered and broad-headed shafts, despatched both Drupada<br>and Virata unto the abode of Yama. Upon the fall of Virata and Drupada,<br>and the slaughter of the Kshatriyas, the Chedis, the Matsyas, and the<br>Panchalas, and upon the fall of those three heroes, viz., the three<br>grandsons of Drupada, the high-souled Dhrishtadyumna, beholding those<br>feats of Drona, became filled with rage and grief, and swore in the midst<br>of all the ear-warriors, saying, 'Let me lose merits of all my religious<br>acts as also my Kshatriya and Brahma energy, if Drona escape me today<br>with life, or if he succeed in vanquishing me!'[248] Having taken that<br>oath in the midst of all the bowmen, that slayer of hostile heroes, viz.,<br>the prince of the Panchalas, supported by his own division, advanced<br>against Drona. The Panchalas then began to strike Drona from one side,<br>and Arjuna from another. Duryodhana, and Karna, and Sakuni, the son of<br>Suvala, and the uterine brothers of Duryodhana (stationed), according to<br>their precedence, began to protect Drona in battle. Drona being thus<br>protected in battle by those illustrious warriors, the Panchalas though<br>struggling vigorously, could not even gaze at him. Then Bhimasena, O<br>sire, became highly angry with Dhrishtadyumna and, O bull among men, that<br>son of Pandu pierced Dhrishtadyumna with these fierce words:[249]<br><br>"Bhimasena said, 'What man is there who being regarded as a Kshatriya and<br>who taking his birth in the race of Drupada and who being the foremost of<br>all persons possessing a knowledge of weapons, would only thus look at<br>his foe stationed before him? What man having seen his sire and son<br>slain, and especially, having sworn such an oath in the midst of the<br>king, would thus be indifferent to his enemy? Yonder stands Drona like a<br>fire swelling with its own energy. Indeed, with bow and arrows<br>constituting his fuel, he is consuming with his energy all the<br>Kshatriyas. Soon will he annihilate the Pandava army. Stand ye (as<br>spectators) and behold my feat. Against Drona himself will I proceed.<br>Having said these words, Vrikodara, filled with rage, penetrated into<br>Drona's array, began to afflict and rout that host. Then the<br>Panchalaprince Dhrishtadyumna, also, penetrating into that large host,<br>engaged himself with Drona in battle. The battle became furious. Such a<br>fierce encounter we had never seen or heard of before, O king, as that<br>which now took place at sunrise of that day. The cars, O sire, were seen<br>to be entangled with one another. The bodies of embodied creatures<br>deprived of lives were scattered all over the field. Some, while<br>proceeding towards another part of the field, were, on the way, assailed<br>by others. Some, while flying away, were struck on their backs, and<br>others on their sides. That general engagement continued to rage<br>fiercely. Soon, however, the morning sun rose.'
