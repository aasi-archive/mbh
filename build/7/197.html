                            "Sanjaya said, 'When the weapon called Narayana was invoked, violent<br>winds began to blow with showers of rain, and peals of thunder were heard<br>although the sky was cloudless. The earth trembled, and the seas swelled<br>up in agitation. The rivers began to run in a contrary course. The<br>summits of mountains, O Bharata, began to split. Diverse animals began to<br>pass by the left side of the Pandavas.[260] Darkness set in, the sun<br>became obscure. Diverse kinds of carnivorous creatures began to alight on<br>the field in joy. The gods, the Danavas, and the Gandharvas, O monarch,<br>all became inspired with fear. Beholding that tremendous agitation (in<br>nature), all began to ask one another loudly about its cause. Indeed,<br>seeing that fierce and terrible weapon invoked by Drona's son, all the<br>kings, inspired with fear, felt great pain.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Tell me, O Sanjaya, what counsel was adopted by the<br>Pandavas for the protection of Dhrishtadyumna when they saw the Kauravas<br>once more advance to battle, rallied by Drona's son who was scorched by<br>grief and unable to brook the slaughter of his sire?'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Having behold before the Dhartarashtras fly away,<br>Yudhishthira, seeing them once more prepared for furious battle,<br>addressed Arjuna, saying, 'After the preceptor Drona had been slain in<br>battle by Dhrishtadyumna, like the mighty Asura, Vritra, by the wielder<br>of the thunderbolt, (the Kurus), O Dhananjaya, becoming cheerless, gave<br>up all hopes of victory. Desirous of saving themselves, all of them fled<br>away from battle. Some kings fled, riding on cars borne along irregular<br>course without Parshni drivers, and divested of standards and banners and<br>umbrellas, and with their Kuvaras and boxes broken, and all their<br>equipments displaced. Others, struck with panic and deprived of their<br>senses, themselves striking the steeds of their cars with their feet,<br>fled precipitately. Others, riding on cars with broken yokes and wheels<br>and Akshas, fled afflicted with fear. Others on horseback were carried<br>away, their bodies half displaced from their saddles. Others, dislodged<br>from their seats, and pinned by shafts to the necks of elephants, were<br>quickly carried away by those animals. Others wore trodden to death all<br>around by elephants, afflicted and mangled with arrows. Others, deprived<br>of weapons and divested of armour, fell from their vehicles and animal<br>down upon the earth. Others were cut by car-wheels, or crushed by steeds<br>and elephants. Others loudly calling after their sires and sons, fled<br>away in fear, without recognising one another, deprived of all energy by<br>grief. Some, placing their sons and sires and friends and brothers (on<br>vehicles) and taking off their armour, were seen washing them with water.<br>After the slaughter of Drona, (the Kuru) army, fallen into such a plight,<br>fled away precipitously. By whom then hath it been rallied? Tell me, if<br>thou knowest. The sound of neighing steeds and trumpeting elephants,<br>mingled with the clatter of car-wheels, is heard loud. These sounds, so<br>fierce, occuring in the Kuru ocean, are repeatedly swelling up and<br>causing my troops to tremble. This terrific uproar, making the hair stand<br>on end, that is now heard, would, it seems, swallow the three worlds with<br>Indra at their head. I think this terrible uproar is uttered by the<br>wielder of the thunderbolt himself. It is evident that upon the fall of<br>Drona, Vasava himself is approaching (against us) for the sake of the<br>Kauravas. Our hairs have stood on their ends, our foremost of<br>car-warriors are all afflicted with anxiety. O Dhanaujaya, hearing this<br>loud and terrible noise, I ask thee who is that mighty car-warrior, like<br>the lord of the celestials himself, that rallying this terrible and<br>swelling host, is causing it to return?'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'He, relying upon whose energy the Kauravas, having<br>addressed themselves to the accomplishment of fierce feats, are blowing<br>their conchs and staying with patience, he about whom thou hast thy<br>doubts. O king, as to who he may be that is roaring so loud, having<br>rallied the Dhartarashtras after the fall of the disarmed preceptor, he,<br>who is endued with modesty, possessed of mighty arms, has the tread of an<br>infuriated elephant, owns a face like that of a tiger, always achieves<br>fierce feats, and dispels the fears of the Kurus, he upon whose birth<br>Drona gave away a thousand kine unto Brahmanas of high worth, he O king,<br>that is roaring so loud, is Aswatthaman. As soon as he was born, that<br>hero neighed like Indra's steed and caused the three worlds to tremble at<br>that sound. Hearing that sound, an invisible being, O lord, (speaking<br>audibly) bestowed upon him the name of Aswatthaman (the horse-voiced).<br>That hero, O son of Pandu, is roaring today. Prishata's son, by an<br>exceedingly cruel act, assailed Drona and took his life as if the latter<br>was without a preceptor. Yonder stayeth the preceptor of that Drona.<br>Since of the prince of the Panchalas seized my preceptor by the hair,<br>Aswatthaman, confident of his own prowess, will never forgive him. Thou,<br>O monarch, hath told thy preceptor a falsehood for the sake of kingdom!<br>Although thou art acquainted with the dictates of righteousness, thou<br>hast yet perpetrated a very sinful act. Thy ill fame, in consequence of<br>the slaughter of Drona, will be eternal in the three worlds with their<br>mobile and immobile creatures, like Rama's in consequence of the<br>slaughter of Bali![261] About thyself, Drona had thought, 'The son of<br>Pandu is possessed of every virtue; he is, besides, my disciple. He will<br>never speak an untruth to me.' Thinking so, he gave credence to what thou<br>hadst said. Although in speaking of Aswatthaman's death thou hadst added<br>the world elephant, yet thy answer to the preceptor was, after all, an<br>untruth in the garb of truth. Thus told by thee, the puissant Drona laid<br>aside his weapons and, as thou sawest, became indifferent (to<br>everything), exceedingly agitated, and almost deprived of his senses. It<br>was even a disciple who, abandoning all morality, thus slew his own<br>preceptor, full of affection for his son, while, indeed, that preceptor<br>was filled with grief and unwilling to fight. Having caused him, who had<br>laid his weapons to be unrighteously slain, protect the son of Prishata<br>if thou canst, with all thy counsellors. All of us, uniting together,<br>shall not be able to protect Prishata's son today, who will be assailed<br>by the preceptor's son in wrath and grief. That superhuman being who is<br>in that habit of displaying his friendship for all creatures, that hero,<br>hearing of the seizure of his sire's locks, will certainly consume us all<br>in battle today. Although I cried repeatedly at the top of my voice for<br>saving the preceptor's life, yet, disregarding my cries and abandoning<br>mortality, a disciple took the life of that preceptor. All of us have<br>passed the greater part of our lives. The days that remain to us are<br>limited. This exceedingly unrighteous act that we have perpetrated has<br>stained that remnant. In consequence of the affection he bore to us, he<br>was a sire unto us. According to the dictates of the scriptures also, he<br>was a sire unto us. Yet he, that preceptor of ours, has been slain by us<br>for the sake of short-lived sovereignty. Dhritarashtra, O king, had given<br>unto Bhishma and Drona the whole earth, and what was still more valuable,<br>all his children. Though honoured by our foe thus, and though he had<br>obtained such wealth from him, the preceptor still loved us as his own<br>children. Of unfading energy and prowess, the preceptor has been slain,<br>only because, induced by thy words he had laid aside his weapons. While<br>engaged in fight he was incapable of being slain by Indra himself. The<br>preceptor was venerable in years and always devoted to our welfare. Yet<br>unrighteous that we are, and stained with a levity of behaviour, we<br>scrupled not to injure him. Alas, exceedingly cruel and very heinous has<br>been the sin that we have committed, for, moved by the desire of enjoying<br>the pleasures of sovereignty, we have slain that Drona. My preceptor had<br>all along been under the impression that in consequence of my love for<br>him, I could, (for his sake) abandon all,&#8212;sire, brother, children, wife<br>and life itself. And yet moved by the desire of sovereignty, I interfered<br>not when he was about to be slain. For this fault, O king, I have, O<br>lord, already sunk into hell, overcome with shame. Having, for the sake<br>of kingdom, caused the slaughter of one who was a Brahmana, who was<br>venerable in years, who was my preceptor, who had laid aside his weapons,<br>and who was then devoted, like a great ascetic, to Yoga, death has become<br>preferable to me to life!'
