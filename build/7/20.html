                            "Sanjaya said, 'Having passed the night, that mighty car-warrior viz.,<br>Bharadwaja's son, addressed Suyodhana, O monarch, saying, 'I am<br>thine![33] I have made arrangements for Partha's encounter with the<br>Samsaptaka.'[34] After Partha went out for slaying the Samsaptakas, Drona<br>then, at the head of his troops arrayed for battle, proceeded, O chief of<br>the Bharatas, for seizing king Yudhishthira the just. Seeing that Drona<br>had arrayed his forces in the form of a Garuda, Yudhishthira disposed his<br>troops in counter array in the form of a semi-circle. In the mouth of<br>that Garuda was the mighty car-warrior Drona himself. And its head was<br>formed by king Duryodhana, surrounded by his uterine brothers. And<br>Kritavarman and the illustrious Kripa formed the two eyes of that Garuda.<br>And Bhutasarman, and Kshemasarman, and the valiant Karakaksha, and the<br>Kalingas, the Singhalas, the Easterners, the Sudras, the Abhiras, the<br>Daserakas, the Sakas, the Yavanas, the Kamvojas, the Hangsapadas, the<br>Surasenas, the Daradas, the Madras, and the Kalikeyas, with hundreds and<br>thousands of elephants, steeds, cars, and foot-soldiers were stationed at<br>its neck. And Bhurisravah. and Salya, and Somadatta, and Valhika, these<br>heroes, surrounded by a full Akshauhini, took up their position in the<br>right wing. And Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti, and Sudakshina, the ruler<br>of the Kamvojas, stationed themselves in the left wing at the head,<br>however, of Drona's son Aswatthaman. In the back (of that Garuda) were<br>the Kalingas, the Amvashthas, the Magadhas, the Paundras, the Madrakas,<br>the Gandharas, the Sakunas, the Easterners, the Mountaineers, and the<br>Vasatis. In the tail stood Vikartana's son Karna, with his sons, kinsmen<br>and friends, and surrounded by a large force raised from diverse realms,<br>Jayadratha, and Bhimaratha, and Sampati, and the Jays, and the Bhojas,<br>and Bhuminjaya, and Vrisha, and Kratha, and the mighty ruler of the<br>Nishadhas, all accomplished in battle, surrounded by a large host and<br>keeping the region of Brahma before their eyes, stood, O king, in the<br>heart of that array. That array, formed by Drona, in consequence of its<br>foot-soldiers, steeds, cars and elephants, seemed to surge like the<br>tempest-tossed ocean (as it advanced to battle). Warriors, desirous of<br>battle, began to start out from the wings and sides of that array, like<br>roaring clouds charged with lightning rushing from all sides (in the<br>welkin) at summer. And in the midst of that army, the ruler of the<br>Pragjyotishas, mounted on his duly equipped elephant, looked resplendent,<br>O king, like the rising sun. Decked, O monarch, in garlands of flower,<br>and with a white umbrella held over his head, he looked like the full<br>moon when in conjunction with the constellation Krittika. And blind with<br>the wine-like exudation, the elephant, looking like a mass of black<br>antimony, shone like a huge mountain washed by mighty clouds (with their<br>showers). And the ruler of the Pragjyotishas was surrounded by many<br>heroic kings of the hilly countries, armed with diverse weapons, like<br>Sakra himself surrounded by the celestials. Then Yudhishthira, beholding<br>that superhuman array incapable of being vanquished by foes in battle,<br>addressed Prishata's son, saying, 'O lord, O thou that ownest steeds<br>white as pigeons, let such measures be adopted that I may not be taken a<br>prisoner by the Brahmana.'<br><br>"Dhrishtadyumna said, 'O thou of excellent vows, never shalt thou be<br>placed under the power of Drona, however much may he strive. Even I shall<br>check Drona today with all his followers. As long as I am alive, O thou<br>of Kuru's race, it behoveth thee not to feel any anxiety. Under no<br>circumstances will Drona be able to vanquish me in battle.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Having said these words, the mighty son of Drupada<br>owning steeds of the hue of pigeons, scattering his shafts, rushed<br>himself at Drona. Beholding that (to him) evil omen in the form of<br>Dhrishtadyumna stationed before him, Drona soon became exceedingly<br>cheerless. Beholding this, that crusher of foes, viz., thy son Durmukha,<br>desirous of doing what was agreeable to Drona, began to resist<br>Dhrishtadyumna. Then a terrible and a fierce battle took place, O<br>Bharata, between the brave son of Prishata and thy son, Durmukha. Then<br>Prishata's son, quickly covering Durmukha, with a shower of arrows,<br>checked Bharadwaja's son also with a thick arrowy downpour. Beholding<br>Drona checked, thy son Durmukha quickly rushed at Prishata's son and<br>confounded him with clouds of arrows of diverse kinds. And while the<br>prince of the Panchalas and that foremost one of Kuru's race were thus<br>engaged in battle, Drona consumed many sections of Yudhishthira's host.<br>As a mass of clouds is dispersed in different directions by the wind,<br>even so was Yudhisthira's host, in many parts of the field, scattered by<br>Drona. For only a short while did that battle look like an ordinary<br>combat. And then, O king, it became an encounter of infuriated persons in<br>which no consideration was shown for anybody. And the combatants could no<br>longer distinguish their own men from the foe. And the battle raged on,<br>the warriors being guided by inferences and watch-words. Upon the gems on<br>their headgears, upon their necklaces and other ornaments, and upon their<br>coats of mail, rays of light like those of the Sun seemed to fall and<br>play. And cars and elephants and steeds, decked with streaming banners,<br>seemed in that battle to resemble masses of clouds with flocks of cranes<br>under them. And men slew men, and steeds of fiery metal slew steeds, and<br>car-warriors slew car-warriors and elephants slew elephants. And soon a<br>fierce and terrible encounter took place between elephants with tall<br>standards on their backs and mighty compeers (rushing against them). All<br>in consequence of those huge creatures rubbing their bodies against those<br>of hostile compeers and tearing one another (with their tusks), fires<br>mixed with smoke were generated there by (such) friction of countless<br>tusks with tusks. Shorn of the standards (on their backs), those<br>elephants, in consequence of the fires caused by their tusks, looked like<br>masses of clouds in the welkin charged with lightning. And the earth,<br>strewn with elephants dragging (hostile compeers) and roaring and falling<br>down, looked beautiful like the autumnal sky overspread with clouds. And<br>the roars of those elephants while they were being slaughtered with<br>showers of shafts and lances, sounded like the roll of clouds in the<br>rainy season. And some huge elephants, wounded with lances and shafts,<br>became panic-stricken. And others amongst those creatures, left the field<br>with loud cries.[35] And some elephants there, struck by others with<br>their tusks, uttered fierce yells of distress that resounded like the<br>roll of the all-destroying clouds at the end of the Yuga. And some,<br>turned back by huge antagonists, returned to the charge, urged on by<br>sharp hooks. And crushing hostile ranks, they began to kill all who came<br>in their way. And elephant-drivers, attacked by elephant-drivers with<br>arrows and lances, fell down from the backs of their beasts, their<br>weapons and hooks being loosened from their hands. And many elephants,<br>without riders on their backs, wandered hither and thither like clouds<br>torn from mightier masses, and then fell down, encountering one another.<br>And some huge elephants, bearing on their backs slain and fallen<br>warriors, or those whose weapons had fallen down, wandered in all<br>directions singly.[36] And in the midst of that carnage, some elephants<br>attacked, or in course of being attacked with lances, swords and battle<br>axes, fell down in course of that awful carnage, uttering sounds of<br>distress. And the earth, suddenly struck with the falling bodies, huge as<br>hills, of those creatures all around trembled and emitted sounds. And<br>with those elephants slain along with their riders and lying all about<br>with the standards on their backs, the earth looked beautiful as if<br>strewn with hills. And the drivers on the backs of many elephants, with<br>their breasts pierced by car-warriors with broad-headed shafts in that<br>battle, fell down, their lances and hooks loosened from their grasp. And<br>some elephants, struck with long shafts, uttered crane like cries and ran<br>in all directions, crushing friends and foes by trampling them to death.<br>And covered with countless bodies of elephants and steeds and<br>car-warriors, the earth, O king, became miry with flesh and blood. And<br>large cars with wheels and many without wheels, crushed by the points of<br>their tusks, were thrown up by elephants, with the warriors mounted on<br>them. Cars were seen deprived of warriors. And riderless steeds and<br>elephants ran in all directions, afflicted with wounds. And there father<br>slew his son, and son slew his sire, for the battle that took place was<br>exceedingly fierce and nothing could be distinguished. Men sank<br>ankle-deep in the gory mire and looked like tall trees whose lower parts<br>were swallowed up in a blazing forest-conflagration. And robes and coats<br>of mail and umbrellas and standards having been dyed with blood,<br>everything seemed to be bloody on the field. Large bodies of slain<br>steeds, of cars, and of men, were again cut into fragments by the rolling<br>of car-wheels. And that sea of troops having elephants for its current,<br>and slain men for its floating moss and weeds, and cars for its fierce,<br>eddies, looked terribly grim. Warriors, having steeds and elephants for<br>their large vessels, and desirous of victory as their wealth, plunged<br>into that sea, and instead of sinking in it endeavoured to deprive their<br>enemies of their senses. When all the warriors, each bearing particular<br>signs, were covered with arrowy showers, there was none amongst them lost<br>heart, though all were deprived of their signs. In that fierce and awful<br>battle, Drona confounding the senses of his foes, (at last) rushed at<br>Yudhishthira.'"
