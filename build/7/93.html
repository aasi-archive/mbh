                            "Sanjaya said, 'After the son of Kunti, impelled by the desire of slaying<br>the ruler of the Sindhus, had penetrated (into the Bharata host) having<br>pierced through the irresistible divisions of both Drona and the Bhojas,<br>after the heir of the ruler of the Kamvojas, viz., prince Sudakshina, had<br>been slain, after Savyasachin had killed the valiant Srutayudha also,<br>after the (Kuru) ranks had fled away and confusion had set in on all<br>sides, thy son, beholding his army broken, repaired to Drona. Quickly<br>coming on his car to Drona, Duryodhana said: 'That tiger among men (viz.,<br>Arjuna), having crushed this vast host hath already passed through it.<br>Aided by thy judgment, think now what should be done next for the<br>slaughter of Arjuna in view of awful carnage. Blessed be thou, adopt such<br>measures that that tiger among men may not succeed in slaying Jayadratha.<br>Thou art our sole refuge. Like a raging conflagration consuming heaps of<br>dry grass and straw, Dhananjaya-fire, urged by the wind of his wrath, is<br>consuming the grass and straw constituted by my troops. O scorcher of<br>foes, seeing the son of Kunti pass, having pierced through this host,<br>those warriors that are protecting Jayadratha have become doubtful (of<br>their ability to resist Partha). O foremost of those acquainted with<br>Brahma, it was the settled conviction of the kings that Dhananjaya would<br>never, with life, succeed in transgressing Drona. O thou of great<br>splendour, when, however, Partha has pierced through thy division in the<br>very sight, I regard my army to be very weak. Indeed, I think that I have<br>no troops. O thou that art highly blessed, I know thou art devoted to the<br>welfare of the Pandavas. I lose my reason, o regenerate one, in thinking<br>what should be done. To the best of my power, I also seek to gratify<br>thee. Thou, however, dost not bear all this in mind. O thou of<br>immeasurable prowess, although we are devoted to thee, still thou never<br>seekest our welfare. Thou art always well-pleased with the Pandavas and<br>always engaged in doing us evil. Though deriving thy livelihood from us,<br>still thou art engaged in doing evil to us. I was not aware that thou art<br>but a razor steeped in honey. If thou hadst not granted me the boon about<br>humiliating and checking the Pandavas, I would never have prevented the<br>ruler of the Sindhus from returning to his own country. Fool that I am,<br>expecting protection from thee, I assured the ruler of the Sindhus, and<br>through my folly offered him as a victim to death. A man may escape,<br>having entered the very jaws of death, but there is no escape for<br>Jayadratha, when once he comes within reach of Dhananjaya's arms. O thou<br>that ownest red steeds, do that by which the ruler of the Sindhus may yet<br>be saved. Do not give way to wrath on hearing the delirious ravings of my<br>afflicted self, O, protect ye the ruler of the Sindhus.'<br><br>"Drona said, 'I do not find fault with thy words. Thou art as dear to me<br>as Aswatthaman himself. I tell thee truly. Act, however, now according to<br>my words, O king! Of all drivers of cars, Krishna is the foremost. His<br>steeds are also the foremost of their species. Obtaining only a very<br>small space, Dhananjaya can pass very quickly through it. Seest thou not<br>that the shafts of the diadem-decked (Arjuna), countless in number, shot<br>from his bow, are falling full two miles behind his car as he is<br>proceeding? Burdened with the weight of years, I am now incapable of<br>going so fast. The whole army of the Parthas, again, is now close upon<br>our van. Yudhishthira also should be seized by me. Even so, O thou of<br>mighty arms, hath been the vow made by me in the Presence of all bowmen<br>and in the midst of all the Kshatriyas. O king! he is now staying at the<br>head of his troops, abandoned by Dhananjaya. I shall not, therefore,<br>abandoning the gate of our array, fight with Phalguna. It is meet that<br>thyself, properly supported, shouldst fight With that foe of thine, who<br>is alone and who is thy equal in lineage and feats. Do not fear. Go and<br>fight with him. Thou art the ruler of the world. Thou art a king. Thou<br>art a hero. Possessed of fame, thou art accomplished in vanquishing (thy<br>foes). O brave subjugator of hostile towns, go thyself to that spot where<br>Dhananjaya the son of Pritha is.'<br><br>"Duryodhana said, 'O preceptor, how is it possible for me to resist<br>Dhananjaya who has transgressed even thee that art the foremost of all<br>wielders of arms? The very chief of celestials, armed with the thunder,<br>is capable of being vanquished in battle, but Arjuna that subjugator of<br>hostile towns, cannot be vanquished in battle. He by whom Hridika's son<br>(Kritavarman), the ruler of the Bhojas, and thyself equal unto a<br>celestial, have both been vanquished by the power of his weapons, he by<br>whom Srutayus hath been slain, as also Sudakshina, and king Srutayus too,<br>he by whom both Srutayus and Achyutayus and myriads of Mlecchas also have<br>been slain, how can I contend in battle with that invincible son of<br>Pandu, that accomplished master of weapons, who is even like an<br>all-consuming fire? How also dost thou think me competent to fight with<br>him today? I am dependent on thee like a slave. Protect my fame.'<br><br>"Drona said, 'Thou sayest truly, O thou of Kuru's race, that Dhananjaya<br>is irresistible. I, however, will do that by which thou shalt be able to<br>bear him. Let all the bowmen in the world behold today the wonderful feat<br>of the son of Kunti being held in check by thee in the very sight of<br>Vasudeva. This thy armour of gold, O king, I will tie on thy body in such<br>a way that no weapon used by man will be able to strike thee in battle.<br>If even the three worlds with the Asuras and the celestials, the Yakshas,<br>the Uragas, and the Rakshasas, together with all human beings, fight with<br>thee today, thou needst still entertain no fear. Neither Krishna, nor the<br>son of Kunti, nor any other wielder of weapons in battle, will be able to<br>pierce this armour of thine with arrows. Cased in that coat of mail,<br>quickly go thou today against angry Arjuna in battle. He will not be able<br>to bear thee.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Having said these words, Drona, that foremost of persons<br>conversant with Brahma, touching water, and duly uttering certain<br>Mantras, speedily tied that highly wonderful and bright armour on<br>Duryodhana's body for the victory of thy son in that dreadful battle and<br>causing (by that act) all persons there to be filled with amazement. And<br>Drona said, 'Let the Vedas, and Brahman, and the Brahmanas, bless thee.<br>Let all the higher classes of reptiles be a source of blessings to thee,<br>O Bharata! Let Yayati and Nahusha, and Dhundhumara, and Bhagiratha, and<br>the other royal sages, all do what is beneficial to thee. Let blessings<br>be to thee from creatures having but one leg, and from those that have<br>many legs. Let blessings be to thee, in this great battle from creatures<br>that have no legs. Let Swaha, and Swadha, and Sachi, also, all do what is<br>beneficial to thee. O sinless one, let Lakshmi and Arundhati too do what<br>is beneficial to thee. Let Asita, and Devala and Viswamitra, and Angiras,<br>and Vasishtha, and Kasyapa, O king, do what is beneficial to thee. Let<br>Dhatri, and the lord of the worlds and the points of the compass and the<br>regents of those points, and the six-faced Karttikeya, all give thee what<br>is beneficial. Let the divine Vivaswat benefit thee completely. Let the<br>four elephants, of the four quarters, the earth, the firmament, the<br>planets, and he who is underneath the earth and holds her (on his head),<br>O king, viz., Sesha, that foremost of snakes, give thee what is for thy<br>benefit. O son of Gandhari, formerly the Asura named Vritra, displaying<br>his prowess in battle, had defeated the best of celestials in battle. The<br>latter, numbering thousands upon thousands, with mangled bodies, those<br>denizens of heaven, with Indra at their head, deprived of energy and<br>might, all repaired to Brahman and sought his protection, afraid of the<br>great Asura Vritra. And the gods said, 'O best of gods, O foremost of<br>celestials, be thou the refuge of the gods now crushed by Vritra. Indeed,<br>rescue us from this great fear.' Then Brahmana, addressing Vishnu staying<br>beside him as also those best of celestials headed by Sakra, said unto<br>them that were all cheerless, these words fraught with truth: Indeed, the<br>gods with Indra at their head, and the Brahmanas also, should ever be<br>protected by me. The energy of Tvashtri from which Vritra hath been<br>created is invincible. Having in days of yore performed ascetic penances<br>for a million of years, Tvashtri, then, ye gods, created Vritra,<br>obtaining permission from Maheswara. That mighty foe of yours hath<br>succeeded in smiting you through the grace of that god of gods. Without<br>going to the place where Sankara stayeth, ye cannot see the divine Hara.<br>Having seen that god, ye will be able to vanquish Vritra. Therefore, go<br>ye without delay to the mountains of Mandara. There stayeth that origin<br>of ascetic penances, that destroyer of Daksha's sacrifice, that wielder<br>of Pinaka, that lord of all creatures, that slayer of the Asura called<br>Bhaganetra.' Thus addressed by Brahman, the gods proceeding to Mandara<br>with Brahman in their company, beheld there that heap of energy, that<br>Supreme god endued with the splendour of a million suns. Seeing the gods<br>Maheswara welcomed them and enquired what he was to do for them. 'The<br>sight of ray person can never be fruitless. Let the fruition of your<br>desires proceed from this.' Thus addressed by him, the dwellers of heaven<br>replied, 'We have been deprived of our energy by Vritra. Be thou the<br>refuge of the dwellers of heaven. Behold, O lord, our bodies beaten and<br>bruised by his strokes. We seek thy protection. Be thou our refuge, O<br>Maheswara!' The god of gods, called Sarva, then said, 'Ye gods, it is<br>well-known to you how this action, fraught with great strength, terrible<br>and incapable of being resisted by persons destitute of ascetic merit,<br>originated, springing from the energy of Tvashtri (the divine artificer).<br>As regards myself, it is certainly my duty to render aid to the dwellers<br>of heaven. O Sakra, take this effulgent armour from off my body. And, O<br>chief of the celestials, put it on, mentally uttering these mantras.'<br><br>"Drona continued, 'Having said these words, the boon-giving (Siva) gave<br>that armour with the mantras (to be uttered by the wearer). Protected by<br>that armour, Sakra proceeded against the host of Vritra in battle. And<br>although diverse kinds of weapons were hurled at him in that dreadful<br>battle, yet the joints of that armour could not be cut open. Then the<br>lord of the celestials slew Vritra, and afterwards gave unto Angiras that<br>armour, whose joints were made up of mantras. And Angiras imparted those<br>mantras to his son Vrihaspati, having a knowledge of all mantras. And<br>Vrihaspati imparted that knowledge to Agnivesya of great intelligence.<br>And Agnivesya imparted it to me, and it is with the aid of those mantras,<br>O best of kings, that I, for protecting thy body, tie this armour on thy<br>body.'<br><br>`Sanjaya continued, Having said these words Drona, that bull among<br>preceptors, once more addressed thy son, of great splendour, saying, 'O<br>king, I put this armour on thy body, joining its pieces with the aid of<br>Brahma strings. In days of yore, Brahma himself had thus put it on Vishnu<br>in battle. Even as Brahma himself had put this celestial armour on Sakra<br>in the battle caused by the abduction of Taraka, I put it on thee.'<br>Having thus, with mantras, donned that armour duly on Duryodhana, the<br>regenerate Drona sent the king to battle. And the mighty-armed king,<br>cased in armour by the high-souled preceptor, and accomplished in<br>smiting, and a thousand infuriated elephants endued with great prowess,<br>and a hundred thousand horses, and many other mighty car-warriors,<br>proceeded towards the car of Arjuna. And the mighty-armed king proceeded,<br>with the sound of diverse kinds of musical instruments, against his foe,<br>like Virochana's son (Vali in days of yore). Then, O Bharata, a loud<br>uproar arose among thy troops, beholding the Kuru king proceeding like a<br>fathomless ocean.'"
