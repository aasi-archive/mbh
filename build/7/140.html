                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then the great bowmen of the Trigarta country owning<br>standards, adorned with gold, encompassed on all sides the mighty-armed<br>Satyaki, that warrior who accomplished with great activity everything<br>that demanded accomplishment and who, having penetrated into that host,<br>unlimited as the sea, was rushing against Duhsasana's car from desire of<br>Dhananjaya's success. Checking his course with a large throng of cars on<br>all sides, those great bowmen, excited with rage, covered him with<br>showers of arrows. Having penetrated into the midst of the Bharata army<br>which resembled a shoreless sea, and which, filled with the sound of<br>palms abounded with swords and darts and maces, Satyaki, of prowess<br>incapable of being baffled, alone vanquished his foes, those fifty<br>(Trigarta) princes shining brilliantly in that battle. On that occasion<br>we saw that the conduct of Sini's grandson in battle was extremely<br>wonderful. So great was the lightness (of his movements) that having seen<br>him on the west, we immediately saw him in the east. North, south, east,<br>west, and in the other subsidiary directions, that hero seemed to career<br>dancingly, as if he constituted a hundred warriors in his single self.<br>Beholding that conduct of Satyaki, endued with the sportive tread of the<br>lion, the Trigarta warriors, unable to bear his prowess fled away towards<br>(the division of) their own (countrymen). Then the brave warriors of the<br>Surasenas endeavoured to check Satyaki, striking him with showers of<br>shafts, like a driver striking an infuriated elephant with the hook. The<br>high-souled Satyaki struggled with them for a short space of time and<br>then that hero of inconceivable prowess began to fight with the Kalingas.<br>Transgressing that division of the Kalingas which was incapable of being<br>crossed, the mighty-armed Satyaki approached the presence of Dhananjaya,<br>the son of Pritha. Like a tired swimmer in water when he reaches the<br>land, Yuyudhana became comforted on obtaining the sight of Dhananjaya,<br>that tiger among men. Beholding him approach, Kesava, addressing Partha,<br>said, 'Yonder cometh the grandson of Sini, O Partha, following in thy<br>wake. O thou of prowess incapable of being baffled, he is thy disciple<br>and friend. That bull among men, regarding all the warriors as straw,<br>hath vanquished them. Inflicting terrible injuries upon the Kaurava<br>warriors, Satyaki, who is dear to thee as life, cometh towards thee, O<br>Kiritin! Having with his shafts crushed Drona himself and Kritavarman of<br>the Bhoja race, this Satyaki cometh to thee, O Phalguna! Intent on<br>Yudhishthira's good, having slain many foremost of warriors, the brave<br>Satyaki, skilled in weapons, is coming to thee, O Phalguna! Having<br>achieved the most difficult feat in the midst of the (Kaurava) troops,<br>the mighty Satyaki, desirous of obtaining thy sight cometh to thee, O son<br>of Pandu! Having on a single car fought in battle many mighty<br>car-warriors with the preceptor (Drona) on their head, Satyaki cometh to<br>thee, O Partha! Despatched by Dharma's son, this Satyaki cometh to thee,<br>O Partha, having pierced through the Kaurava army, relying on the might<br>of his own arms. Invincible in battle, that Satyaki, who hath no warrior<br>amongst the Kauravas equal to him, is coming to thee, O son of Kunti!<br>Having slain, countless warriors, this Satyaki cometh to thee, O Partha,<br>freed from amid the Kaurva troops, like a lion from amid a herd of kine.<br>Having strewn the earth with the faces, beautiful as the lotus, of<br>thousands of kings, this Satyaki is coming to thee, O Partha! Having<br>vanquished in battle Duryodhana himself with his brothers, and having<br>slain Jalasandha, Satyaki is coming quickly. Having caused a river of<br>blood for its mire, and regarding the Kauravas as straw, Satyaki cometh<br>towards thee.' The son of Kunti, without being cheerful, said these words<br>unto Kesava, 'The arrival of Satyaki, O mighty-armed one, is scarcely<br>agreeable to me. I do not, O Kesava, know how king Yudhishthira the Just<br>is. Now that he is separated from Satwata, I doubt whether he is alive; O<br>mighty-armed one, this Satyaki should have protected the king. Why then,<br>O Krishna, hath this one, leaving Yudhishthira followed in my wake? The<br>king, therefore, hath been abandoned to Drona. The ruler of the Sindhus<br>hath not yet been slain. There, Bhurisravas is proceeding against Satyaki<br>in battle. A heavier burthen hath been cast upon me on account of<br>Jayadratha. I should know how the ling is and I should also protect<br>Satyaki. I should also slay Jayadratha. The sun hangeth low. As regards<br>the mighty-armed Satyaki, he is tired; his weapons also have been<br>exhausted. His steeds as also their driver, are tired, O Madhava!<br>Bhurisravas, on the other hand, is not tired, he hath supporters behind<br>him, O Kesava! Will success be Satyaki's in this encounter? Having<br>crossed the very ocean, will Satyaki of unbaffled prowess, will that bull<br>amongst the Sinis, of great energy, succumb, obtaining (before him) the<br>vestige of a cow's foot?[166] Encountering that foremost one amongst the<br>Kurus, viz., the high-souled Bhurisravas, skilled in weapons, will<br>Satyaki have good fortune? I regard this, O Kesava, to have been an error<br>of judgment on the part of king Yudhishthira the Just. Casting of all<br>fear of the preceptor, he hath despatched Satyaki (from away his side).<br>Like a sky-ranging hawk after a peace of meat, Drona always endeavoureth<br>after the seizure of king Yudhishthira the Just. Will the king be free<br>from all danger?'
