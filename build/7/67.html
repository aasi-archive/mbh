                            "Narada said, 'Rantideva, the son of Srinjaya, we hear, fell a prey to<br>death. That high-souled king had two hundred thousand cooks to distribute<br>excellent food, raw and cooked, like unto Amrita, unto the Brahmanas, by<br>day and by night, who might come to his house as guests.[109] The king<br>gave away unto the Brahmanas his wealth acquired by righteous means.<br>Having studied the Vedas, he subjugated his foes in fair fight. Of rigid<br>vows and always engaged in due performance of sacrifices, countless<br>animals, desirous of going to heaven, used to come to him of their own<br>accord.[110] So large was the number of animals sacrificed in the<br>Agnihotra of that king that the secretions flowing from his kitchen from<br>the heaps of skins deposited there caused a veritable river which from<br>this circumstance, came to be called the Charmanwati.[111] He,<br>incessantly gave away nishkas of bright gold unto the Brahmanas, 'I give<br>thee nishkas.' 'I give thee nishkas,' these were the words incessantly<br>uttered by him. 'I give thee,' 'I give thee' saying these words he gave<br>away thousands of nishkas. And once again, with soft words to the<br>Brahmanas, he gave away nishkas. Having given away, in course of a single<br>day, one crore of such coins, he thought that he had given away very<br>little. And, therefore, he would give away more. Who else is there that<br>would be able to give what he gave? The king gave away wealth, thinking,<br>If I do not give wealth in the hands of Brahmanas, great and eternal<br>grief, without doubt, will be mine.' For a hundred years, every<br>fortnight, he gave unto thousands of Brahmanas a golden bull into each,<br>followed by a century of kine and eight hundred pieces of nishkas. All<br>the articles that were needed for his Agnihotra, and all that were needed<br>for his other sacrifices, he gave away unto the Rishis, including<br>Karukas[112] and water-pots and plates and beds and carpets and vehicles,<br>and mansions and houses, and diverse kinds of trees, and various kinds of<br>viands. Whatever utensils and articles Rantideva possessed were of gold.<br>They that are acquainted with the history of ancient times seeing the<br>superhuman affluence of Rantideva, sing this song, viz., 'We have not<br>seen such accumulated treasures even in the abode of Kuvera; what need be<br>said, therefore, of human beings?' And people wonderingly said, Without<br>doubt, the kingdom of Rantideva is made of gold.[113] On such nights,<br>when guests were assembled in the abode of Rantideva, one and twenty<br>thousand kine were sacrificed (for feeding them). And yet the royal cook<br>adorned with begemmed ear-rings, had to cry out, saying, 'Eat as much<br>soup as you like, for, of meat, there is not as much today as in other<br>days. Whatever gold was left belonging to Rantideva, he gave even that<br>remnant away unto the Brahmanas during the progress of one of his<br>sacrifices. In his very sight the gods used to take the libations of<br>clarified butter poured into the fire for them, and the Pitris the food<br>that was offered to them, in Sraddhas. And all superior Brahmanas used to<br>obtain from him (the means of gratifying) all their desires. When he<br>died, O Srinjaya, who was superior to thee in respect of the four<br>cardinal virtues and who, superior to thee was, therefore, much superior<br>to thy son, thou shouldst not, saying, 'Oh, Swaitya, Oh, Swaitya,' grieve<br>for the latter who performed no sacrifice and made no sacrificial<br>present.'"
