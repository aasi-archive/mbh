                            "Sanjaya said, 'Slaying the force of Duhsasana, the mighty car-warrior,<br>Savyasachin, desirous of getting at the ruler of the Sindhus, proceeded<br>against the division of Drona, Having approached Drona who was stationed<br>at the entrance of the array, Partha, at Krishna's request joined his<br>hands and said these words unto Drona: 'Wish me well, O Brahmana, and<br>bless me, saying Swasti! Through thy grace, I wish to penetrate into this<br>impenetrable array. Thou art to me even as my sire, or even as king<br>Yudhishthira the just, or even as Krishna! I tell thee this truly. O<br>sire, O sinless one! Even as Aswatthaman deserves to be protected by<br>thee, I also deserve to be protected by thee, O foremost of regenerate<br>ones! Through thy grace, O foremost of men, I desire to stay the ruler of<br>the Sindhu in battle. O lord, see that my vow is accomplished.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed by him, the preceptor, smiling,<br>replied unto him, saying, 'O Vibhatsu, without vanquishing me, thou shalt<br>not be able to vanquish Jayadratha. Telling him this much, Drona, with a<br>smile covered him with showers of sharp arrows, as also his car and<br>steeds and standard and charioteer. Then, Arjuna baffling Drona's arrowy<br>showers with his own arrows, rushed against Drona, shooting mightier and<br>More awful shafts. Observant of Kshatriya duties, Arjuna then pierced<br>Drona in that battle with nine arrows. Cutting the shafts of Arjuna by<br>his own shafts, Drona then pierced both Krishna and Arjuna with many<br>shafts that resembled poison or fire, Then, while Arjuna was thinking of<br>cutting of Drona's bow with his arrows, the latter, endued with great<br>valour, fearlessly and quickly cut off, with shafts the bow-string of the<br>illustrious Phalguna. And he also pierced Phalguna's steeds and standard<br>and charioteer. And the heroic Drona covered Phalguna himself with many<br>arrows, smiling the while. Meantime, stringing his large bow anew,<br>Partha, that foremost of all persons conversant with arms, getting the<br>better of his preceptor, quickly shot six hundred arrows as if he had<br>taken and shot only one arrow. And once more he shot seven hundred other<br>arrows, and then a thousand arrows incapable of being resisted, and ten<br>thousand other arrows. All these slew many warriors of Drona's array.<br>Deeply pierced with those weapons by the mighty and accomplished Partha,<br>acquainted with all modes of warfare, many men and steeds and elephants<br>fell down deprived of life. And car-warriors, afflicted by those shafts,<br>fell down from their foremost of cars, deprived of horses and standards<br>and destitute of weapons and life. And elephants fell down like summits<br>of hills, or masses of clouds, or large houses, loosened, dispersed, or<br>burnt down by the thunder, or by the wind, or fire. Struck with Arjuna's<br>shafts, thousands of steeds fell down like swans on the breast of<br>Himavat, struck down by the force of watery current. Like the Sun, that<br>rises at the end of the Yuga, drying up with his rays, vast quantities of<br>water, the son of Pandu, by his showers of weapons and arrows, slew a<br>vast number of car-warriors and steeds and elephants and foot-soldiers.<br>Then like the clouds covering the sun, the Drona-cloud, with its arrowy<br>showers, covered the Pandava-sun, whose rays in the shape of thick<br>showers of arrows were scorching in the battle the foremost ones among<br>the Kurus. And then the preceptor struck Dhananjaya at the breast with a<br>long shaft shot with great force and capable of drinking the life-blood<br>of every foe. Then Arjuna, deprived of strength, shook in all his limbs,<br>like a hill during an earthquake. Soon, however, regaining for fortitude,<br>Vibhatsu pierced Drona with many winged arrows. Then Drona struck<br>Vasudeva with five arrows. And he struck Arjuna with three and seventy<br>arrows, and his standard with three. Then, O king, the valorous Drona<br>getting the better of his disciple, within the twinkling of an eye made<br>Arjuna invisible by means of his arrowy showers. We then beheld the<br>shafts of Bharadwaja's son falling in continuous lines, and his bow also<br>was seen to present the wonderful aspect of being incessantly drawn to a<br>circle. And those shafts, countless in number, and winged with the Kanka<br>feathers, shot by Drona in that battle, incessantly fell, O king, on<br>Dhananjaya and Vasudeva. Beholding then that battle between Drona and the<br>son of Pandu, Vasudeva of great intelligence began to reflect upon the<br>accomplishment of the (important) task. Then Vasudeva, addressing<br>Dhananjaya, said these words: 'O Partha, O thou of mighty arms, we should<br>not waste time. We must go on, avoiding Drona, for a more important task<br>awaits us. In reply Partha said unto Krishna, O Kesava, as thou pleasest!<br>Then keeping the mighty-armed Drona to their right, Arjuna proceeded<br>onwards. Turning his face round, Vibhatsu proceeded, shooting his shafts.<br>Then Drona, addressing Arjuna, said, Whither dost thou proceed, O son of<br>Pandu! Is it not true that thou ceasest not (to fight) till thou hast<br>vanquished thy foe?'<br><br>"Arjuna answered, 'Thou art my preceptor and not my foe. I am thy<br>disciple and, therefore, like to thy son. Nor is there the man in the<br>whole world who can vanquish thee in battle.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Saying these words, the mighty-armed Vibhatsu,<br>desirous of slaying Jayadratha, quickly proceeded against the (Kaurava)<br>troops. And while he penetrated into thy army, those high-souled princes<br>of Panchala, viz., Yudhamanyu, and Uttamaujas, followed him as the<br>protector of his wheels. Then, O King, Jaya, and Kritavarman of the<br>Satwata race, and the ruler of the Kamvojas, and Srutayus, began to<br>oppose the progress of Dhananjaya. And these had ten thousand<br>car-warriors for their followers. The Abhishahas, the Surasenas, the<br>Sivis, the Vasatis, the Mavellakas, the Lilithyas, the Kaikeyas, the<br>Madrakas, the Narayana Gopalas, and the various tribes of the Kamvojas<br>who had before been vanquished by Karna, all of whom were regarded as<br>very brave, placing Bharadwaja's son at their head, and becoming<br>regardless of their lives, rushed towards Arjuna, for resisting that<br>angry hero, burning with grief on account of the death of his son, that<br>warrior resembling all-destroying Death himself, clad in mail, conversant<br>with all modes of warfare, prepared to throw away his life in thick of<br>battle,&#8212;that mighty bowman of great prowess, that tiger among men,&#8212;who<br>resembled an infuriate leader of elephantine herd, and who seemed ready<br>to devour the whole hostile army. The battle then that commenced was<br>exceedingly fierce and made the hair stand on end, between all those<br>combatants on the one side and Arjuna on the other. And all of them,<br>uniting together, began to resist that bull among men, advancing for the<br>slaughter of Jayadratha, like medicines resisting a raging disease.'"
