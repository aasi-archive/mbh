                            "Sanjaya said, 'Vrikodara, however, could not brook that slaughter of his<br>army. He struck Valhika with sixty and Karna with ten arrows. Drona then,<br>desirous of slaying Bhima, quickly struck the latter, in his very vitals,<br>many straight and whetted shafts of keen edge. Desirous again of allowing<br>no time, he once more struck him with, six and twenty shafts whose touch<br>resembled that of fire and which were all like snakes of virulent poison.<br>Then Karna pierced him with a dozen shafts, and Aswatthaman with seven,<br>and king Duryodhana also with six. The mighty Bhimasena, in return,<br>pierced them all. He struck Drona with fifty shafts, and Karna with ten.<br>And piercing Duryodhana with a dozen shafts, and Drona with eight, he<br>engaged in that battle uttering a loud shout. In that encounter in which<br>the warriors fought reckless of their lives and in which death was easy<br>of attainment, Ajatasattru despatched many warriors, urging them to<br>rescue Bhima. Those heroes of immeasurable energy, viz., the two son of<br>Madri and Pandu, and others headed by Yuyudhana, quickly proceeded to<br>Bhimasena's side. And those bulls among men, filled with rage and uniting<br>together, advanced to battle, desirous of breaking the army of Drona that<br>was protected by many foremost of bowmen. Indeed, those great<br>car-warriors of mighty energy, viz., Bhima and others, fell furiously<br>upon Drona's host. Drona, however, that foremost of car-warriors,<br>received without any anxiety, all those mighty car-warriors, of great<br>strength,&#8212;those heroes accomplished in battle. Disregarding their<br>kingdoms and casting off all fear of death, the warriors of thy army<br>proceeded against the Pandavas. Horsemen encountered horsemen, and<br>car-warriors encountered car-warriors. The battle proceeded, darts<br>against darts, swords against swords, axes against axes. A fierce<br>encounter with swords took place, producing a terrible carnage. And in<br>consequence of the collision of elephants against elephants the battle<br>became furious. Some fell down from the backs of elephants, and some from<br>the backs of steeds, with heads downwards. And others, O sire, fell down<br>from cars, pierced with arrows. In that fierce press, as some one fell<br>down deprived of armour, an elephant might be seen attacking him in the<br>chest and crushing his head. Elsewhere might be seen elephants crushing<br>numbers of men fallen down on the field. And many elephants, piercing the<br>earth with their tusks (as they fell down), were seen to tear therewith<br>large bodies of men. Many elephants, again, with arrows sticking to their<br>trunks, wandered over the field, tearing and crushing men by hundreds.<br>And some elephants were seen pressing down into the earth fallen warriors<br>and steeds and elephants cased in armour of black iron, as if these were<br>only thick reeds. Many kings, graced with modesty, their hour having<br>come, laid themselves down (for the last sleep) on painful beds, overlaid<br>with vultures' feathers. Advancing to battle on his car, sire slew son;<br>and son also, through madness all losing regard, approached-sire in<br>battle. The wheels of cars were broken; banners were torn; umbrellas fell<br>down on the earth. Dragging broken yokes, steeds ran away. Arms with<br>swords in grasp, and heads decked with ear-rings fell down. Cars, dragged<br>by mighty elephants, thrown down on the ground, were reduced to<br>fragments. Steeds with riders fell down, severely wounded by elephants.<br>That fierce battle went on, without anybody showing any regard for any<br>one. 'Oh father!&#8212;Oh son!&#8212;Where art thou, friend?&#8212;Wait!&#8212;Where dost<br>thou go!&#8212;Strike!&#8212;Bring! Slay this one!'&#8212;these and diverse other cries,<br>with loud laughs and shouts, and roars were uttered and heard there. The<br>blood of human beings and steeds and elephants, mingled together. The<br>earthy dust disappeared. The hearts of all timid persons became<br>cheerless. Here a hero getting his car-wheel entangled with the car-wheel<br>of another hero, and the distance being too near to admit of the use of<br>other weapons, smashed that other's head by means of his mace. Brave<br>combatants, desirous of safety where there was no safety, dragged one<br>another by the hair, and fought fiercely with fists, and teeth and nails.<br>Here was a hero whose upraised arm with sword in grasp was cut off, There<br>another's arm was lopped off with bow, or arrow or hook in grasp. Here<br>one loudly called upon another. There another turned his back on the<br>field. Here one severed another's head from his trunk, getting him within<br>reach. There another rushed with loud shouts Upon an enemy. Here one was<br>filled with fear at another's roar. There another slew with sharp shafts<br>a friend or a foe. Here an elephant, huge as a hill, slain with a long<br>shaft, fell down en the field and lay like a flat island in a river<br>during the summer season. There an elephant, with sweat trickling down<br>its body, like a mountain with rills flowing adown its breast, steed,<br>having crushed by its tread a car-warrior with his steeds and charioteer<br>on the field. Beholding brave warriors, accomplished in arms and covered<br>with blood, strike one another, they that were timid and of weak hearts,<br>lost their senses. In fact, all became cheerless. Nothing could any<br>longer be distinguished. Overwhelmed with the dust raised by the troops,<br>the battle became furious. Then the commander of the Pandava forces<br>saying, 'This is the time,' speedily led the Pandavas on those heroes<br>that are always endued with great activity. Obeying his behest, the<br>mighty-armed Pandavas, smiting (the Katirava army) proceeded towards<br>Drona's car like swans towards a lake,&#8212;'Seize him,'&#8212;-'Do not fly<br>away,'&#8212;'Do not fear,'&#8212;'Cut into pieces,'&#8212;these uproarious cries were<br>heard in the vicinity of Drona's car. Then Drona and Kripa, and Karna and<br>Drona's son, and king Jayadratha, and Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti, and<br>Salya, received those heroes. Those irresistible and invincible warriors,<br>however, viz., the Panchalas and the Pandavas, inspired by noble<br>sentiments, did not, though afflicted with shafts, avoid Drona. Then<br>Drona, excited with great rage, shot hundreds of shafts, and caused a<br>great carnage amongst the Chedis, the Panchalas, and the Pandavas. The<br>twang of his bowstring and the slaps of his palms, were, O sire, heard on<br>all sides. And they resembled the roar of thunder and struck fear into<br>the hearts of all. Meanwhile, Jishnu, having vanquished large number of<br>Samsaptakas, quickly came to that place where Drona was grinding the<br>Pandava troops. Having crossed many large lakes whose waters were<br>constituted by blood, and whose fierce billows and eddies were<br>constituted by shafts, and having slain the Samsaptakas, Phalguni showed<br>himself there. Possessed of great fame and endued as he was with the<br>energy of the Sun himself, Arjuna's emblem, viz., his banner bearing the<br>ape, was beheld by us to blaze with splendour. Having dried up the<br>Samsaptaka ocean by means of weapons that constituted his rays, the son<br>of Pandu then blasted the Kurus also, as if he were the very Sun that<br>arises at the end of the Yuga. Indeed, Arjuna scorched all the Kurus by<br>the heat of his weapons, like the fire[61] that appears at the end of the<br>Yuga, burning down all creatures. Struck by him with thousands of shafts,<br>elephant warriors and horsemen and car-warriors fell down on the earth,<br>with dishevelled hair, and exceedingly afflicted with those arrowy<br>showers, some uttered cries of distress. Others set up loud shouts. And<br>some struck with the shafts of Partha, fell down deprived of life.<br>Recollecting the practices of (good) warriors, Arjuna struck not those<br>combatants among the foe that had fallen down, or those that were<br>retreating, or those that were unwilling to fight. Deprived of their cars<br>and filled with wonder, almost all the Kauravas, turning away from the<br>field, uttered cries of Oh and Alas and called upon Karna (for<br>protection). Hearing that din made by the Kurus, desirous of protection,<br>Adhiratha's son (Karna), loudly assuring the troops with the words 'Do<br>not fear' proceeded to face Arjuna. Then (Karna) that foremost of Bharata<br>car-warriors, that delighter of all the Bharatas, that first of all<br>persons acquainted with weapons, invoked into existence the Agneya<br>weapon. Dhananjaya, however, baffled by means of his own arrowy downpours<br>the flights of arrows shot by Radha's son, that warrior of the blazing<br>bow, that hero of bright shafts. And similarly, Adhiratha's son also<br>baffled the shafts of Arjuna of supreme energy. Resisting Arjuna's<br>weapons thus by his own, Karna uttered loud shouts and shot many shafts<br>at his antagonist. Then Dhristadyumna and Bhima and the mighty<br>car-warrior Satyaki, all approached Karna, and each of them pierced in<br>with three straight shafts. The son of Radha, however, checking Arjuna's<br>weapons by his own arrowy showers, cut off with three sharp shafts the<br>bows of those three warriors. Their bows cut off, they looked like snakes<br>without poison. Hurling darts at their foe from their respective cars,<br>they uttered loud leonine shouts. Those fierce darts of great splendour<br>and great impetuosity, looking like snakes, hurled from those mighty<br>arms, coursed impetuously towards Karna's car. Cutting each of those<br>darts with three straight arrows and speeding many arrows at the same<br>time at Partha, the mighty Karna uttered a loud shout. Then Arjuna<br>piercing Karna with seven shafts, despatched the latter's younger brother<br>by means of his sharp shafts. Slaying Satrunjaya thus with six arrows,<br>Partha, with a broad-headed shaft, struck off Vipatha's head as the<br>latter stood on his car. In the very sight of the Dhritarashtras,<br>therefore, as also of the Suta's son, the three uterine brothers of the<br>latter were despatched by Arjuna unaided by any one. Then Bhima, jumping<br>down from his own car, like a second Garuda, slew with his excellent<br>sword five and ten combatants amongst those that supported Karna.<br>Mounting once more on his car and taking up another bow, he pierced Karna<br>with ten shafts and his charioteer and steeds with five. Dhrishtadyumna<br>also taking up a sword and a bright shield; despatched Charmavarman and<br>also Vrihatkshatra, the ruler of the Naishadhas. The Panchala prince<br>then, mounting upon his own car and taking up another bow, pierced Karna<br>with three and seventy shafts, and uttered a loud roar. Sini's grandson<br>also, of splendour equal to that of Indra himself, taking up another bow<br>pierced Suta's son with four and sixty shafts and roared like a lion. And<br>cutting off Karna's bow with a couple of well-shot shafts, he once more<br>pierced Karna on the arms and the chest with three arrows. The king<br>Duryodhana, and Drona and Jayadratha, rescued Karna from the<br>Satyaki-ocean, as the former was about to sink into it. And foot-soldiers<br>and steeds and cars and elephants, belonging to thy army and numbering by<br>hundreds, all accomplished in smitting rushed to the spot where Karna was<br>frightening (his assailants). Then Dhrishtadyumna, and Bhima and<br>Subhadra's son, and Arjuna himself, and Nakula, and Sahadeva, began to<br>protect Satyaki in that battle. Even thus went on that fierce battle for<br>the destruction of bowmen belonging to thy army and of the enemy's. All<br>the combatants fought, reckless of their very lives. Infantry and cars<br>and steeds and elephants were engaged with cars and infantry.<br>Car-warriors were engaged with elephants and foot-soldiers and steeds,<br>and cars and foot-soldiers were engaged with cars and elephants. And<br>steeds were seen engaged with steeds, and elephants with elephants, and<br>foot-soldiers with foot-soldiers. Even thus did that battle, marked by<br>great confusion, take place, enhancing the delight of cannibals and<br>carnivorous creatures, between those high-souled men facing one another<br>fearlessly. Indeed, it largely swelled the population of Yama's kingdom.<br>Large numbers of elephants and cars and foot-soldiers and steeds were<br>destroyed by men, cars, steeds and elephants. And elephants were slain by<br>elephants, and car-warriors with weapons upraised by car-warriors, and<br>steeds by steeds, and large bodies of foot-soldiers. And elephants were<br>slain by cars, and large steeds by large elephants and men by steeds; and<br>steeds by foremost of car-warriors. With tongues lolling out, and teeth<br>and eyes pressed out of their places, with coats of mail and ornaments<br>crushed into dust, the slaughtered creatures fell down on the field.<br>Others, again, of terrible mien were struck and thrown down on the earth<br>by others armed with diverse and excellent weapons and sunk into the<br>earth by the tread of steeds and elephants, and tortured and mangled by<br>heavy cars and car wheels. And during the progress of that fierce carnage<br>so delightful to beasts of prey and carnivorous birds and cannibals,<br>mighty combatants, filled with wrath, and slaughtering one another<br>careered over the field putting forth all their energy. Then when both<br>the hosts were broken and mangled, the warriors bathed in blood, looked<br>at each other. Meanwhile, the Sun went to his chambers in the western<br>hills, and both the armies, O Bharata, slowly retired to their respective<br>tents.
