                            "Sanjaya said, 'When the sun turned in his downward course towards the<br>summit of the Asta hills, when the welkin was covered with dust, when the<br>heat of the solar rays abated, the day began to fade fast. As regards the<br>soldiers, some rested, some fought on, some returned to the encounter,<br>desirous of victory. And while the troops, inspired with hope of victory,<br>were thus engaged, Arjuna and Vasudeva proceeded towards the place where<br>the ruler of the Sindhus was. The son of Kunti, by means of his shafts,<br>made (through the hostile soldiers) a way sufficiently wide for his car.<br>And it was in this way that Janardana proceeded, (guiding the car).<br>Thither where the car of the high-souled son of Pandu proceeded, thither<br>thy troops, O monarch, broke and yielded a way. And he of Dasarha's race,<br>endued with great energy, displayed his skill in driving car by showing<br>diverse kinds of circling motions. And the shafts of Arjuna, engraved<br>with his name, well-tempered, resembling the Yuga-fire, tied round with<br>catgut, of straight joints, thick, far-reaching, and mace either of<br>(cleft) bamboo (or their branches) or wholly of iron, taking the lives of<br>diverse foes, drank in that battle, with the birds (of prey assembled<br>there), the blood of living creatures. Standing on his car, as Arjuna<br>shot his shafts full two miles ahead, those shafts pierced and despatched<br>his foes just as that car itself came up to the spot.[141] Hrishikesa<br>proceeded, borne by those yoke-bearing steeds endued with the speed of<br>Garuda or the wind, with such speed that he caused the whole universe to<br>wonder at it. Indeed, O king, the car of Surya himself, or that of Rudra<br>or that of Vaisravana, never goeth so fast. Nobody else's car had ever<br>before moved with such speed in battle as Arjuna's car, moving with the<br>celerity of a wish cherished in the mind. Then Kesava, O king, that<br>slayer of hostile heroes, having taken the car of battle quickly urged<br>the steeds, O Bharata, through the (hostile) troops. Arrived in the midst<br>of that throng of cars, those excellent steeds bore Arjuna's car with<br>difficulty, suffering as they did from hunger, thirst, and toil, and<br>mangled as they had been with the weapons of many heroes delighting in<br>battle. They frequently, however, described beautiful circles as they<br>moved, proceeding over the bodies of slain steeds and men, over broken<br>cars, and the bodies of dead elephants, looking like hills by thousands.<br><br>"Meanwhile O king, the two heroic brothers of Avanti, (viz., Vinda and<br>Anuvinda), at the head of their forces, beholding the steeds of Arjuna to<br>be tired, encountered him. Filled with joy, they pierced Arjuna with four<br>and sixty shafts, and Janardana with seventy, and the four steeds (of<br>Arjuna's car) with a hundred arrows. Then Arjuna, O king, filled with<br>wrath, and having a knowledge of the vital parts of the body, struck them<br>both in the battle, with nine straight shafts, every one of which was<br>capable of penetrating into the very vitals. Thereupon, the two brothers,<br>filled with rage, covered Vibhatsu and Kesava with showers of shafts and<br>uttered leonine roars. Then Partha of white steeds, with a couple of<br>broad-headed shafts, quickly cut off in that battle the beautiful bows of<br>the two brothers and then their two standards, bright as gold. Vinda and<br>Anuvinda then, O king, taking up to other bows and becoming infuriated<br>with anger, began to grind the son of Pandu with their arrows. Then<br>Dhananjaya, the son of Pandu, exceedingly enraged, once more, with a<br>couple of shafts quickly cut off those two bows also of his foes. And<br>with a few other arrows whetted on stone and equipped with wings of gold,<br>Arjuna then slew their steeds, their charioteers, and the two combatants<br>that protected their rear, with those that followed the latter. And with<br>another broad-headed arrow, sharp as a razor, he cut off the head of the<br>eldest brother, who fell down on the earth, deprived of life, like a tree<br>broken by the wind. The mighty Anuvinda then endued with great prowess,<br>beholding Vinda slain left his steedless car, having taken up a mace.<br>Then that foremost of car-warriors, viz., the brother of Vinda,<br>apparently dancing as he advanced with that mace in his arms, proceeded<br>in that battle for avenging the slaughter of his elder brother. Filled<br>with rage, Anuvinda struck Vasudeva on the forehead with that mace. The<br>latter, however, trembled not, but stood still like the mountain Mainaka.<br>Then Arjuna with six arrows, cut off his neck and two legs and two arms<br>and head. Thus cut off (into fragments, the limbs of) Anuvinda fell down<br>like so many hills. Beholding them both stain, their followers, O king,<br>filled with rage rushed (towards Arjuna), scattering hundreds of arrows.<br>Slaying them soon, O bull of Bharata's race, Arjuna looked resplendent<br>like a fire consuming a forest on the expiry of winter. Passing over<br>those troops with some difficulty, Dhananjaya then shone brightly like<br>the risen sun, transgressing the clouds under which it was hid. Beholding<br>him, the Kauravas were filled with fright. But recovering soon enough,<br>they rejoiced once more and rushed at him from all sides. O bull of<br>Bharata's race! Understanding that he was tired and that the ruler of the<br>Sindhus was yet at a distance, they surrounded him, uttering leonine<br>roars. Beholding them, tilled with wrath, Arjuna, that bull among men,<br>smilingly, addressed him of Dasarha's race in soft words, and said, 'Our<br>steeds are afflicted with arrows and tired. The ruler of the Sindhus is<br>still at a distance. What do you think to be the best that should be done<br>now? Tell me, O Krishna, truly. Thou art always the wisest of persons.<br>The Pandavas having thee for their eyes, will vanquish their foes in<br>battle. That which seems to me should be done next, truly shall I say<br>unto thee. Unyoking the steeds to their case, pluck off their arrows, O<br>Madhava!' Thus addressed by Partha, Kesava replied unto him, 'I am, also<br>O Partha, of the opinion which thou hast expressed.'<br><br>"Arjuna then said, 'I will hold in check the whole army, O Kesava! Do<br>thou properly perform that which should be done next.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Alighting then from the terrace of his car,<br>Dhananjaya, taking up his bow, Gandiva, fearlessly stood there like an<br>immovable hill. Beholding Dhananjaya standing on the ground, and<br>regarding it a good opportunity, the Kshatriyas, desirous of victory and<br>uttering loud shouts, rushed towards him. Him standing along, they<br>surrounded with a large throng of cars, all stretching their bows and<br>showering their shafts on him. Filled with wrath, they displayed diverse<br>kinds of weapons and entirely shrouded Partha with their shafts like the<br>clouds shrouding the sun. And the great Kshatriya warriors impetuously<br>rushed against that bull among Kshatriyas, that lion among men, like<br>infuriated elephants rushing towards a lion. The might then that we<br>beheld, of Partha's arms was exceedingly great, since, filled with rage,<br>alone, he succeeded in resisting those countless warriors. The puissant<br>Partha, baffling with his own weapons those of the foes, quickly covered<br>all of them with countless shafts. In that part of the welkin, O monarch,<br>in consequence of the clash Of those dense showers of shafts, a fire was<br>generated emitting incessant sparks. There, in consequence of hostile<br>heroes, countless in number, all filled with wrath, and all great bowmen<br>united together for a common Purpose, seeking victory in battle, aided by<br>steeds, covered with blood and breathing hard, and by infuriated and<br>foe-grinding elephants, uttering loud shrieks, the atmosphere became<br>exceedingly hot. That uncrossable, wide, and limitless ocean of cars,<br>incapable of being agitated, had arrows for its current, standards for<br>its eddies, elephants for its crocodiles, foot-soldiers for its countless<br>fishes, the blare of conchs and the beat of drums for its roar, cars for<br>its surging waves, head-gears of combatants for its tortoises, umbrellas<br>and banners for its froth, and the bodies of slain elephants for its<br>(submarine) rocks: Partha resisted with his arrows, the approach of the<br>sea like a continent. Then, in course of that battle, the mighty-armed<br>Janardana, fearlessly addressing that dear friend of his, that foremost<br>of men, viz., Arjuna, said unto him. 'There is no well here in the field<br>of battle, O Arjuna, for the steeds to drink from. The steeds want water<br>for drink, but not for a bath.' Thus addressed by Vasudeva, Arjuna<br>cheerfully said, 'Here it is!' And so saying, he pierced the earth with a<br>weapon and made an excellent lake from which the steeds could drink. And<br>that lake abounded in swans and ducks, and was adorned with Chakravakas.<br>And it was wide and full of transparent water, and abounded in full-blown<br>lotuses of the finest species. And it teemed with diverse kinds of fish.<br>And fathomless in depth, it was the resort of many a Rishi. And the<br>celestial Rishi, Narada, came to have a look at that lake created there<br>in a moment. And Partha, capable of achieving wonderful works like (the<br>celestial artificer) Tvashtri himself, also constructed there an arrowy<br>hall, having arrows for its beams and rafters, arrows for its pillars,<br>and arrows for its roof. Then Govinda smiling in joy, said, 'Excellent,<br>Excellent,' upon seeing the high-souled Partha create that arrowy hall.'"
