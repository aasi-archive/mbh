                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Tell me, O Sanjaya, what did my warriors do after<br>the heroic ruler of the Sindhus had been slain, by Arjuna.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the ruler of the Sindhus, O sire, slain in<br>battle by Partha, Kripa, the son of Saradwat, under the influence of<br>wrath, covered the son of Pandu with a dense shower of arrows. Drona's<br>son also, on his car, rushed against Phalguna, the son of Pritha. Those<br>two foremost of car-warriors began from their cars to shower from<br>opposite directions upon the son of Pandu their keen arrows. That<br>foremost of car-warriors, viz., the mighty-armed Arjuna, afflicted by<br>those arrowy showers of (Kripa and Drona's son) felt great pain. Without<br>desiring, however, to slay his preceptor (Kripa) as also the son of (his<br>other preceptor) Drona, Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, began to act like a<br>preceptor in arms. Baffling with his own weapons those of both<br>Aswatthaman and Kripa, he sped at them, without desiring to slay them,<br>shafts that coursed mildly. Those shafts, however (though mildly), shot<br>by Jaya struck the two with great force, and in consequence of their<br>number, caused great pain to Kripa and his nephew. Then Saradwat's son, O<br>king, thus afflicted with the arrows of Arjuna, lost all strength and<br>swooned away on the terrace of his car. Understanding his master<br>afflicted with shafts to be deprived of his senses, and believing him to<br>be dead, the driver of Kripa's car bore Kripa away from the fight. And<br>after Kripa, the son of Saradwat, had thus been borne away from the<br>battle, Aswatthaman also, from fear, fled away from the son of Pandu.<br>Then the mighty bowman, Partha, beholding the son of Saradwat afflicted<br>with shafts and in a swoon, began to indulge, on his car, in piteous<br>lamentations. With a tearful face and in great dejection of heart, he<br>uttered these words: Beholding all this (in his mental vision), Vidura of<br>great wisdom had, on the birth of the wretched Suyodhana, that<br>exterminator of his race, said unto Dhritarashtra, 'Let this wretch of<br>his race be soon killed. Owing to him, a great calamity will overtake the<br>foremost ones of Kuru's race.` Alas, these words of the truth-telling<br>Vidura have come to be true. It is for him that I behold my preceptor<br>today lying on a bed of arrows. Fie on the practices of Kshatriya! Fie on<br>my might and prowess! Who else like me would fight with a Brahmana that<br>is, besides his preceptor? Kripa is the son of a Rishi; he is, again, my<br>preceptor; he is also the dear friend of Drona. Alas, he lieth stretched<br>on the terrace of his car, afflicted with my arrows. Though not wishing<br>it, I have still been the means of crushing him with my shafts. Lying<br>senseless on the terrace of his car, he paineth my heart exceedingly.<br>Even though he afflicted me with shafts, I should still have only looked<br>at that warrior of dazzling splendour (without striking him in return).<br>Struck with numerous shafts of mine, he hath gone the way of all<br>creatures. By that he hath pained me more than even the slaughter of my<br>own son. Behold, O Krishna, to what plight he hath been reduced, thus<br>lying miserably and in a senseless state on his own car. Those bulls<br>among men that give desirable objects unto their preceptors after<br>obtaining knowledge from them, attain to godhead. Those lowest of mortals<br>on the other hand, who, after obtaining knowledge from their preceptors<br>strike the latter, those wicked men, go to hell. Without doubt, this act<br>that I have done will lead me to hell. I have deeply pierced my preceptor<br>on his car with showers of arrows. While studying the science of arms at<br>his feet, Kripa told me in those days, 'Do not, O thou of Kuru's race,<br>ever strike thy preceptor. That command of my righteous and high-souled<br>preceptor I have not obeyed, for I have struck, the very Kripa himself<br>with my shafts. I bow to that worshipful son of Gotama, to that<br>unretreating hero. Fie on me, O thou of Vrishni's race, since I have<br>struck even him.' While Savyasachin was thus lamenting for Kripa, the son<br>of Radha, beholding the ruler of the Sindhu slain, rushed towards him.<br>Seeing the son of Radha thus rushing towards Arjuna the two Panchala<br>princes and Satyaki suddenly rushed towards him. The mighty car-warrior,<br>Partha, beholding the son of Radha advancing, smilingly addressed the son<br>of Devaki and said, 'Yonder cometh the son of Adhiratha against the car<br>of Satyaki. Without doubt, he is unable to bear the slaughter of<br>Bhurisravas in battle. Urge my steeds, O Janardana, towards the spot<br>whither Karna cometh. Let not Vrisha (Karna) cause the Satwata hero to<br>follow in the wake of Bhurisravas.' Thus addressed by Savyasachin, the<br>mighty-armed Kesava, endued with great energy, replied in these opportune<br>words, 'The mighty-armed Satyaki is singly a match for Karna, O son of<br>Pandu! How much superior then will this bull among the Satwatas be when<br>he is united with the two sons of Drupada! For the present, O Partha, it<br>is not proper for thee to fight with Karna. The latter hath with him the<br>blazing dart, like a fierce meteor, that Vasava gave him. O slayer of<br>hostile heroes, he hath kept it for thy sake, worshipping it with<br>reverence. Let Karna then freely proceed against the Satwata hero. I<br>know, O son of Kunti, this wicked wight's hour, when, indeed, thou wilt,<br>with keen shafts, throw him down from his car.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Tell me, O Sanjaya, how the battle took place<br>between the heroic Karna and Satyaki of the Vrishni race, after the fall<br>of Bhurisravas and of the ruler of the Sindhus. Satyaki had been carless,<br>upon what car then was he mounted? And how also did the two protectors of<br>the wheels (of Arjuna's car), viz., the two Panchala princes, fight?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'I will describe to thee all that happened in that<br>dreadful battle. Listen patiently to (the consequences of) thy own evil<br>conduct. Before even the encounter, Krishna knew it in his heart that the<br>heroic Satyaki would be vanquished by the stake-bannered (Bhurisravas).<br>Janardana, O king, knoweth both the past and the future. For this,<br>summoning his charioteer, Daruka, he had commanded him, saying, 'Let my<br>car be kept equipped tomorrow.' Even this had been the command of that<br>mighty one. Neither the gods, nor the Gandharvas, nor the Yakshas, nor<br>the Uragas, nor the Rakshasas, nor human beings, are capable of<br>conquering the two Krishnas. The gods with the Grandsire at their head,<br>as also the Siddhas, know the incomparable prowess of those two. Listen,<br>however, now to the battle as it happened. Beholding Satyaki carless and<br>Karna ready for battle Madhava blew his conch of loud blare in the<br>Rishabha note.[176] Daruka, hearing the blare of (Kesava's) conch,<br>understood the meaning, and soon took that car, equipped with a lofty<br>standard of gold, to where Kesava was. With Kesava's permission, upon<br>that car guided by Daruka, and which resembled the blazing fire or the<br>sun in effulgence, ascended the grandson of Sini. Ascending upon the car<br>which resembled a celestial vehicle and unto which were yoked those<br>foremost of steeds, capable of going everywhere at will, viz., Saivya and<br>Sugriva and Meghapushya and Valahaka, and which were adorned with<br>trappings of gold, Satyaki rushed against the son of Radha, scattering<br>countless shafts. The two protectors of (Arjuna's) car-wheels, viz.,<br>Yudhamanyu and Uttamaujas, abandoning Dhananjaya's car, proceeded against<br>the son of Radha. Radha's son also, O king, shooting showers of shafts,<br>angrily rushed, in that battle, against the invincible grandson of Sini.<br>The battle that took place between them was such that its like had never<br>been heard to have taken place on earth or in heaven between gods,<br>Gandharvas, Asuras, Uragas, or Rakshasas. The entire host consisting of<br>cars, steeds, men, and elephants, abstained from the fight, Beholding, O<br>monarch, the stunning feats of two warriors. All became silent spectators<br>of that superhuman battle between those two human heroes, O king, and of<br>the skill of Daruka in guiding the car. Indeed, beholding the skill of<br>the charioteer Daruka standing on the car, as he guided the vehicle<br>forwards, backwards, sidelong, now wheeling in circles and now stopping<br>outright, all were amazed. The gods, the Gandharvas, and the Danavas, in<br>the welkin, intently watched that battle between Karna and the grandson<br>of Sini. Both of them endued with great might, each challenging the<br>other, those two warriors put forth their prowess for the sake of their<br>friends. Karna who looked like a celestial, and Yuyudhana, O king, rained<br>upon each other showers of shafts. Indeed, Karna ground the grandson of<br>Sini with his arrowy downpours, unable to put up with the slaughter (by<br>Satyaki) of the Kuru hero, Jalasandha. Filled with grief and sighing like<br>a mighty snake, Karna, casting angry glances on the grandson of Sini in<br>that battle, and as if burning him therewith, rushed at him furiously<br>again and again, O Chastiser of foes! Beholding him filled with rage,<br>Satyaki pierced him in return, shooting dense showers of arrows, like an<br>elephant piercing (with his tusks) a rival elephant. Those two tigers<br>among men, endued with the activity of tigers and possessed of<br>incomparable prowess, mangled each other furiously in that battle. The<br>grandson of Sini, then, with shafts made entirely of iron, repeatedly<br>pierced Karna, that chastiser of foes, in all his limbs. And he also<br>felled, with a broad-headed arrow, the charioteer of Karna from his niche<br>in the car. And with his keen shafts, he slew the four steeds, white in<br>hue, of Adhiratha's son. And then cutting into a hundred fragments the<br>standard of Karna with a hundred arrows, that bull among men made Karna<br>carless in the very sight of thy son. Then all thy warriors, O king,<br>became cheerless. Then Vrishasena, the son of Karna, and Salya, the ruler<br>of the Madras, and Drona's son, encompassed the grandson of Sini from all<br>sides. Then a confusion set in, and nothing could be seen. Indeed, when<br>the heroic Karna was made carless by Satyaki, cries of Oh and Alas arose,<br>among all thy troops. Karna also, O king, pierced by Satwata with his<br>arrows and exceedingly weakened ascended the car of Duryodhana, sighing<br>deeply, remembering his friendship for thy son from his childhood and<br>having striven to realise the promise he had made about the bestowal of<br>sovereignty on Duryodhana. After Karna hath been made carless, thy brave<br>sons, headed by Duhsasana, O king, were not slain by the self-restrained<br>Satyaki because the latter wished not to falsify the vow made by<br>Bhimasena. Desirous also of not falsifying the vow formerly made by<br>Partha (about the slaughter of Karna), Satyaki simply made those warriors<br>carless and weakened them exceedingly, but did not deprive them of life.<br>It is Bhima that hath vowed the slaughter of thy sons, and it is Partha<br>that, at the time of the second match at dice, vowed the slaughter of<br>Karna. Although all those warriors headed by Karna made strong efforts<br>for slaying Satyaki, yet those foremost of car-warriors, failed to slay<br>him. Drona's son and Kritavarman and other mighty car-warriors, as also<br>hundreds of foremost Kshatriyas, were all vanquished by Satyaki with only<br>one bow. That hero fought, desirous of benefiting king Yudhishthira the<br>Just, and of attaining to heaven. Indeed, Satyaki, that crusher of foes,<br>is equal to either of the two Krishnas in energy. Smiling the while, he<br>vanquished all thy troops, O best of men! In this world, there are only<br>three mighty bowmen, viz., Krishna, Partha, and Satyaki. There is no<br>fourth to be seen.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Ascending on the invincible car of Vasudeva that<br>had Daruka for its driver, Satyaki, proud of the might of his arms and<br>equal in battle unto Vasudeva himself, made Karna carless. Did Satyaki<br>ride any other car (after his encounter with Karna was over)? I am<br>desirous of hearing this, O Sanjaya! Thou art skilled in narration. I<br>regard Satyaki to be endued with unbearable prowess. Tell me all, O<br>Sanjaya!'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Hear, O king, how it had happened. The intelligent<br>younger brother of Daruka soon brought unto Satyaki another car, duly<br>equipped with all necessaries. With shafts attached to it by chains of<br>iron and gold and bands of silk, decked with a thousand stars, decked<br>with banners and with the figure of a lion on his standard, with horses,<br>fleet as the wind and adorned with trappings of gold, yoked unto it, and<br>with rattle deep as the roar of the clouds, that car was brought unto<br>him. Ascending upon it, the grandson of Sini rushed against thy troops.<br>Daruka, meanwhile, went as he listed to Kesava's side. A new cat was<br>brought for Karna also, O king, unto which were yoked four steeds of the<br>best breed that were decked in trappings of gold and white as conchs or<br>milk. Its kaksha and standard were made of gold. Furnished with banners<br>and machines, that foremost of cars had an excellent driver. And it was<br>furnished with a profusion of weapons of every kind. Mounting on that<br>car, Karna also rushed against his foes. I have now told thee all that<br>thou hadst asked me. Once more, however, O king, learn the (extent of<br>the) destruction caused by the evil policy. Thirty one of thy sons have<br>been slain by Bhimasena. Having Durmukha for their foremost, they were<br>conversant with all modes of warfare. Satyaki and Arjuna also have slain<br>hundreds of heroes with Bhimasena as their foremost, and Bhagadatta also,<br>O sire! Even thus, O king, hath the destruction commenced, caused by thy<br>evil counsels.'
