                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'I think, Destiny is supreme. Fie on exertion which<br>is useless, inasmuch as the son of Adhiratha, though fighting resolutely,<br>could not vanquish the son of Pandu. Karna boasts of his competency to<br>vanquish in battle all the Parthas with Govinda amongst them. I do not<br>see in the world, another warrior like Karna! I often heard Duryodhana<br>speak in this strain. Indeed, O Suta, the wretched Duryodhana used to<br>tell me formerly, 'Karna is a mighty hero, a firm bowman, above all<br>fatigue. If I have that Vasushena for my ally, the very gods will not be<br>a match for me, what need be said, therefore, O monarch, of the sons of<br>Pandu that are weak and heartless?' Tell me therefore, O Sanjaya, what<br>Duryodhana said, beholding that Karna defeated and looking like a snake<br>deprived of its poison and flying away from battle. Alas, deprived of his<br>senses, Duryodhana despatched the unsupported Durmukha, unacquainted<br>though he was with battle, into that fiery encounter, like an insect into<br>the blazing fire. O Sanjaya, even Aswatthaman and the ruler of the Madras<br>and Kripa, united together, could not stand before Bhimasena. Even these<br>know the terrible might, equal to that of ten thousand elephants, of<br>Bhima, endued with the energy of Marut himself, as also his cruel<br>intents. Why did they provoke the fire in battle, of that hero of cruel<br>deeds, that warrior resembling Yama himself as the latter becomes at the<br>end of the Yuga? It seems that Suta's son, the mighty armed Karna alone,<br>relying on the prowess of his own arms, fought in battle with Bhimasena,<br>disregarding the latter. That son of Pandu who vanquished Karna in battle<br>like Purandara vanquishing an Asura, is capable of being vanquished by<br>anybody in fight. Who is there that would, hopeful of life, approach that<br>Bhima who, in Arjuna's quest, alone entered my host, having ground Drona<br>himself? Who, indeed, is there, O Sanjaya, that would dare stay in the<br>face of Bhima? Who is there among the Asuras that would venture to stay<br>before the great Indra with the thunderbolt uplifted in his hand?[157] A<br>man may return having entered the abode of the dead, but none, however,<br>can return having encountered Bhimasena! Those men of weak prowess, who<br>senselessly rushed against the angry Bhimasena were like insects falling<br>upon a blazing fire. Without doubt, reflecting upon what the angry and<br>fierce Bhima had said in the assembly in the hearing of the Kurus about<br>the slaughter of my sons, and beholding the defeat of Karna, Duhsasana<br>and his brothers ceased to encounter Bhima from fear. That wicked son<br>also of mine, O Sanjaya, who repeatedly said in the assembly (these<br>words, viz.,) Karna and Duhsasana and I myself will vanquish the Pandavas<br>in battle,'&#8212;without doubt, beholding Karna defeated and deprived of his<br>car by Bhima, is consumed with grief in consequence of his rejection of<br>Krishna's suit![158] Beholding his mail-clad brothers slain in battle by<br>Bhimasena, in consequence of his own fault, without doubt, my son is<br>burning with grief. Who that is desirous of life will make a hostile<br>advance against Pandu's son, Bhima, excited with wrath armed with<br>terrible weapons and standing in battle like Death himself? A man may<br>escape from the very jaws of the Vadava fire. But it is my belief that no<br>one can escape from before Bhima's face. Indeed, neither Partha, nor the<br>Panchalas, nor Kesava, nor Satyaki, when excited with wrath in battle,<br>shows the least regard for (his) life. Alas, O Suta, the very lives of my<br>sons are in danger.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Thou, O Kaurava, that art thus grieving in view of the<br>present carnage, thou, without doubt, art the root of this destruction of<br>the world! Obedient to the counsels of thy sons, thou hast thyself<br>provoked this fierce hostility. Though urged (by well-wishers) thou<br>acceptest not the proper medicine like a man fated to die. O monarch, O<br>best of men, having thyself drunk the fiercest and the most indigestible<br>poison, take thou all its consequences now. The combatants are fighting<br>to the best of their might, still thou speakest ill of them. Listen,<br>however, to me as I describe to thee how the battle raged on.<br><br>"Beholding Karna defeated by Bhimasena, five of thy sons, those uterine<br>brothers that were great bowmen, could not, O sire, brook it. They were<br>Durmarshana and Duhsaha and Durmada and Durdhara and Jaya. Clad in<br>beautiful mail, all of them rushed against the son of Pandu. Encompassing<br>the mighty-armed Vrikodara, on all sides, they shrouded all the points of<br>the compass with their shafts looking like flights of locusts. Bhimasena,<br>however, in the battle, smilingly received those princes of celestial<br>beauty thus rushing suddenly against him. Beholding thy sons advancing<br>against Bhimasena, Radha's son, Karna rushed against that mighty warrior,<br>shooting arrows of keen points that were equipped with golden wings and<br>whetted on stone. Bhima, however, quickly rushed against Karna, though<br>resisted by thy sons. Then the Kurus, surrounding Karna, covered<br>Bhimasena with showers of straight shafts. With five and twenty arrows, O<br>king, Bhima, armed with his formidable bow, despatched all those bulls<br>among men to Yama's abode with their steeds and charioteers. Falling down<br>from their cars along with their charioteers, their lifeless forms looked<br>like large trees with their weight of variegated flowers uprooted by the<br>tempest. The prowess that we then beheld of Bhimasena was exceedingly<br>wonderful, inasmuch as, resisting Adhiratha's son the while, he slew<br>those sons of thine. Resisted by Bhima with whetted arrows on all sides,<br>the Suta's son, O king, only looked at Bhima. Bhimasena also, with eyes<br>red in wrath, began to cast angry glances on Karna, stretching his<br>formidable bow the while.'"
