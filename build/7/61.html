                            "Narada said, 'Dilipa, the son of Havila, too, O Srinjaya, we hear, fell<br>a prey to death. Brahmanas, vested in knowledge of Truth, devoted to the<br>performance of sacrifices, blessed with children and children's children<br>and numbering myriads upon myriads, were present at his hundreds of<br>sacrifices. King Dilipa, having performed various sacrifices, gave away<br>this earth, filled with treasures, unto the Brahmanas. At the sacrifices<br>of Dilipa, the roads were all made of gold. The very gods, with Indra at<br>their head used to come to him regarding him as Dharma himself. The upper<br>and lower rings of his sacrificial stake were made of gold. Eating his<br>Raga-khandavas, many persons, at his sacrifices, were seen to lie down on<br>the roads. While battling over the waters, the two wheels of Dilipa's car<br>never sank in that liquid. This seemed exceedingly wonderful, and never<br>occured to other kings, Even those that saw king Dilipa, that firm<br>bowman, always truthful in speech and giving away profuse gifts at his<br>sacrifices, succeeded in ascending to heaven. In the abode of Dilipa,<br>called also Khattanga, these five sounds were always to be heard, viz.,<br>the sound of Vedic recitations, the twang of bows, and Drink, Enjoy, and<br>Eat! When he died, O Srinjaya, who was superior to thee in respect of the<br>four cardinal virtues and who superior to thee, was much superior to thy<br>son, thou shouldst not, saying, 'Oh, Swaitya, Oh, Swaitya,' grieve for<br>thy son who performed no sacrifice and made no sacrificial gifts.'"[102]
