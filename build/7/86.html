                            "Sanjaya said, 'I will tell thee all, for everything hath been witnessed<br>by me with my own eyes. Listen calmly. Great is thy fault. Even as an<br>embankment is useless after the waters (of the field) have flowed away,<br>even so, O king, are these lamentations of thine useless! O bull of<br>Bharata's race, do not grieve. Wonderful as are the decrees of the<br>Destroyer, they are incapable of being transgressed. Do not grieve, O<br>bull of Bharata's race, for this is not new. If thou hadst formerly<br>restrained Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, and thy sons also from the<br>match at dice, this calamity then would never have overtaken thee. If,<br>again, when time for battle came, hadst thou restrained both the parties<br>inflamed by wrath, this calamity then would never have overtaken thee.<br>If, again, hadst thou formerly urged the Kurus to slay the disobedient<br>Duryodhana, then this calamity would never have overtaken thee. (If thou<br>hadst done any of these acts), the Pandavas, the Panchalas, the Vrishnis,<br>and the other kings would then have never known thy wrong-headedness. If,<br>again, doing, thy duty as a father, thou hadst, by placing Duryodhana in<br>the path of righteousness, caused him to tread along it, then this<br>calamity would never have overtaken thee. Thou art the wisest man on<br>earth. Forsaking eternal virtue, how couldst thou follow the counsels of<br>Duryodhana and Karna and Sakuni? These lamentations of thine, therefore,<br>O king, that I hear,&#8212;of thine that art wedded to (worldly) wealth, seem<br>to me to be honey mixed with poison. O monarch, formerly Krishna did not<br>respect king Yudhishthira, the son of Pandu, or Drona, so much as he used<br>to respect thee. When, however, he came to know thee as one fallen off<br>from the duties of a king, since then Krishna hath ceased to regard thee<br>with respect. Thy sons had addressed various harsh speeches towards the<br>sons of Pritha. Thou wast indifferent to those speeches then, O thou that<br>wieldest sovereignty, unto thy sons. The consequence of that indifference<br>of thine hath now overtaken thee. O sinless one, the ancestral<br>sovereignty is now in danger. (If it is not so), obtain now the whole<br>earth subjugated by the sons of Pritha.[134] The kingdom that the Kurus<br>enjoy, as also their fame had been acquired by the Pandus. The virtuous<br>sons of Pandu added to that kingdom and that fame. Those achievements,<br>however, of theirs became (to them) barren of fruit as they came in<br>contact with thee, since they were deprived of even their ancestral<br>kingdom by the covetous self. Now, O king, when the battle has begun,<br>thou censurest thy sons indicating diverse faults of theirs. This is<br>scarcely becoming. The Kshatriyas, while fighting, do not take care of<br>their very lives. Indeed, those bulls among Kshatriyas fight, penetrating<br>into the array of the Parthas. Who else, indeed, save the Kauravas, would<br>venture to fight with that force which is protected by Krishna and<br>Arjuna, by Satyaki and Vrikodara? Them that have Arjuna for their<br>warrior, them that have Janardana for their counsellor, them that have<br>Satyaki and Vrikodara for their protectors, what mortal bowman is there<br>that would dare fight with, save the Kauravas and those that are<br>following their lead? All that is capable of being achieved by friendly<br>kings endued with heroism and observant of the duties of Kshatriyas, all<br>that is being done by the warriors on the Kauravas side. Listen now,<br>therefore, to everything that hath taken place in the terrible battle<br>between those tigers among men viz., the Kurus and the Pandavas.'"
