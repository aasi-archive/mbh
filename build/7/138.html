                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then Karna, O king, piercing Bhima with three arrows,<br>poured countless beautiful arrows upon him. The mighty-armed Bhimasena,<br>the son of Pandu, though thus struck by the Suta's son, showed no signs<br>of pain but stood immovable like a hill pierced (with arrows). In return,<br>O sire, in that battle, he deeply pierced Karna in the ear with a barbed<br>arrow, rubbed with oil, of great keenness, and of excellent temper. (With<br>that arrow) he felled on the earth the large and beautiful ear-ring of<br>Karna. And it felled down, O monarch, like a blazing luminary of great<br>effulgence from the firmament. Excited with wrath, Vrikodara, then,<br>smiling the while, deeply pierced the Suta's son in the centre of the<br>chest with another broad-headed arrow. And once again, O Bharata, the<br>mighty-armed Bhima quickly shot in that battle ten long shafts that<br>looked like snakes of virulent poison just freed from their sloughs. Shot<br>by Bhima, those shafts, O sire, striking Karna's forehead, entered it<br>like snakes entering an ant-hill. With those shafts sticking to his<br>forehead, the Suta's son looked beautiful, as he did before, while his<br>brow had been encircled with a chaplet of blue lotuses. Deeply pierced by<br>the active son of Pandu, Karna, supporting himself on the Kuxara of his<br>car, closed his eyes. Soon, however, regaining consciousness, Karna, that<br>scorcher of foes, with his body bathed in blood, became mad with<br>rage.[163] Infuriated with rage in consequence of his being thus<br>afflicted by that firm bowman Karna, endued with great impetuosity,<br>rushed fiercely towards Bhimasena's car. Then, O king, the mighty and<br>wrathful Karna, maddened with rage, shot at Bhimasena, O Bharata, a<br>hundred shafts winged with vulturine feathers. The son of Pandu, however,<br>disregarding his foe and setting at nought his energy, began to shoot<br>showers of fierce arrows at him. Then Karna, O king, excited with rage, O<br>scorcher of foes, struck the son of Pandu, that embodiment of wrath with<br>nine arrows in the chest. Then both those tigers among men (armed with<br>arrows and, therefore), resembling a couple of tigers with fierce teeth,<br>poured upon each other, in that battle, their arrowy showers, like two<br>mighty masses of clouds. They sought to frighten each other in that<br>battle, with sounds of their palms and with showers of arrows of diverse<br>kinds. Excited with rage, each sought in that battle to counteract the<br>other's feat. Then that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the mighty-armed<br>Bhima, O Bharata, cutting off, with a razor-faced arrow, the bow of the<br>Suta's son, uttered a loud shout. Casting off that broken bow, the Suta's<br>son, that mighty car-warrior, took up another bow that was stronger and<br>tougher. Beholding that slaughter of the Kuru, the Sauvira, and the<br>Sindhu heroes, and marking that the earth was covered with coats of mail<br>and standards and weapons lying about, and also seeing the lifeless forms<br>of elephants, foot-soldiers and horsemen and car-warriors on all sides,<br>the body of the Suta's son, from wrath, blazed up with effulgence.<br>Stretching his formidable bow, decked with gold, Radha's son, O king,<br>eyed Bhima with wrathful glances. Infuriated with rage, the Suta's son,<br>while shooting his arrows, looked resplendent, like the autumnal sun of<br>dazzling rays at mid-day. While employed with his hands in taking up an<br>arrow, fixing it on the bow-string, stretching the string and letting it<br>off, none could notice any interval between those acts. And while Karna<br>was thus engaged in shooting his arrows right and left, his bow<br>incessantly drawn to a circle, like a terrible circle of fire. The keen<br>pointed arrows, equipped with wings of gold, shot from Karna's bow,<br>covered, O king, all the points of the compass, darkening the very light<br>of the sun. Countless flights were seen, in the welkin, of those shafts<br>equipped with wings of gold, shot from Karna's bow. Indeed, the shafts<br>shot from the bow of Adhiratha's son, looked like rows of cranes in the<br>sky. The arrows that Adhiratha's son shot were all equipped with<br>vulturine feathers, whetted on stone, decked with gold, endued with great<br>impetuosity, and furnished with blazing points. Impelled by the force of<br>his bow, those arrows urged by Karna, while coursing in thousands through<br>the welkin looked beautiful like successive flights of locusts. The<br>arrows shot from the bow of Adhiratha's son, as they coursed through the<br>welkin, looked like one long continuously drawn arrow in the sky. Like a<br>cloud covering a mountain with torrents of rain, Karna in rage, covered<br>Bhima with showers of arrows. Then thy sons, O Bharata, with their<br>troops, beheld the might, energy, prowess and perseverance of Bhima, for<br>the latter, disregarding that arrowy downpour, resembling the raging sea,<br>rushed in wrath against Karna, Bhima, O monarch, was armed with a<br>formidable bow, the back of whose staff was decked with gold. He<br>stretched it so quickly that it seemed, like a second bow of Indra,<br>incessantly drawn to a circle. Shafts issued continuously from it seemed<br>to fill the welkin. With those straight arrows, equipped with wings of<br>gold, shot by Bhima, a continuous line was made in the sky that looked<br>effulgent like a garland of gold. Then those showers of (Karna's) arrows<br>spread in the welkin, struck by Bhimasena with his shafts, were scattered<br>in portions and fell down on the earth. Then the sky was covered with<br>those showers of gold-winged and swiftly-coursing arrows, of both Karna<br>and Bhimasena, that produced sparks of fire as they clashed against each<br>other. The very sun was then shrouded, and the very wind ceased to blow.<br>Indeed, when the welkin was thus covered with those arrowy showers,<br>nothing could be seen. Then the Suta's son, disregarding the energy of<br>the high-souled Bhima, completely shrouded Bhima with other arrows and<br>endeavoured to prevail over him. Then, O sire, those arrowy showers shot<br>by both of them, seemed to clash against each other like two opposite<br>currents of wind. And in consequence of that clash of the arrowy showers<br>of those two lions among men, a conflagration, O chief of the Bharatas,<br>seemed to be generated in the sky. Then Karna, desirous of slaying Bhima,<br>shot at him in rage many whetted arrows equipped with wings of gold and<br>polished by the hands of the smith. Bhima, however, cut off with his own<br>shafts every one of those arrows into three fragments, and prevailing<br>over the Suta's son, he cried out, 'Wait, Wait.' And the wrathful and<br>mighty son of Pandu, like an all-consuming conflagration, once more shot<br>in rage showers of fierce shafts. And then in consequence of their<br>leathern fences striking against their bow-strings, loud sounds were<br>generated. And loud also became the sound of their palms, and terrible<br>their leonine shouts, and fierce the rattle of their car-wheels and the<br>twang of their bow-strings. And all the combatants, O king, ceased to<br>fight, desirous of beholding the prowess of Karna and of the son of<br>Pandu, each of whom was desirous of slaying the other. And the celestial<br>Rishis and Siddhas and Gandharvas, applauded them, saying, "Excellent,<br>Excellent!' And the tribes of Vidyadharas rained flowery showers upon<br>them. Then the wrathful and mighty-armed Bhima of fierce prowess,<br>baffling with his own weapons the weapons of his foe, pierced the Suta's<br>son with many shafts. Karna also, endued with great might, baffling the<br>shafts of Bhimasena, sped at him nine long shafts in that battle. Bhima,<br>however, with as many arrows, cut off those shafts of Suta's son in the<br>welkin and addressed him, saying, 'Wait, Wait!' Then the mighty-armed and<br>heroic Bhima, excited with rage, shot at Adhiratha's son an arrow<br>resembling the rod of Yama or Death himself. Radha's son, however,<br>smiling, cut off that arrow, O king, of Pandu's son, however, of great<br>Prowess, with three arrows of his, as it coursed towards him through the<br>welkin. The son of Pandu then once more shot showers of fierce shafts.<br>Karna, however, fearlessly received all those arrows of Bhima. Then<br>excited with rage, the Suta's son, Karna, by the power of his weapons,<br>with his straight arrows, cut off in that encounter the couple of quivers<br>and the bow-string of fighting Bhima, as also the traces of his steeds.<br>And then slaying his steeds also, Karna pierced Bhima's charioteer with<br>five shafts. The charioteer, quickly running away, proceeded to<br>Yudhamanyu's car. Excited with rage, the son of Radha then, whose<br>splendour resembled that of the Yuga-fire, smiling the while, cut off the<br>flag-staff of Bhima and felled his banner. Deprived of his bow, the<br>mighty-armed Bhima then seized a dart, such as car-warriors may use.<br>Excited with wrath, he whirled it in his hand and then hurled it with<br>great force at Karna's car. The son of Adhiratha then, with ten shafts,<br>cut off, as it coursed towards him with the effulgence of a large meteor,<br>the gold-decked dart thus hurled (by Bhima).[164] Thereupon, that dart<br>fell down, cut off into ten fragments by those sharp shafts of the Suta's<br>son, Karna, that warrior conversant with every mode of warfare, then<br>battling for the sake of his friends. Then, the son of Kunti took up a<br>shield decked with gold and a sword, desirous of obtaining either death<br>or victory, Karna, however, O Bharata, smiling the while, cut off that<br>bright shield of Bhima with many fierce shafts. Then, car-less, Bhima, O<br>king, deprived of his shield, became mad with rage. Quickly, then, he<br>hurled his formidable sword at Karna's car. That large sword, cutting off<br>the stringed bow of the Suta's son, fell down on the earth, O king, like<br>an angry snake from the sky. Then Adhiratha's son, excited with rage in<br>that battle, smilingly took up another bow destructive of foes, having a<br>stronger string, and tougher than the one he had lost. Desirous of<br>slaying the son of Kunti, Karna then began to shoot thousands of arrows,<br>O king, equipped with wings of gold and endued with great energy. Struck<br>by those shafts shot from Karna's bow, the mighty Bhima leaped into the<br>sky, filling Karna's heart with anguish. Beholding the conduct of Bhima,<br>in battle desirous of victory, the son of Radha beguiled him by<br>concealing himself in his car. Seeing Karna concealing himself with an<br>agitated heart on the terrace of his car, Bhima catching hold of Karna's<br>flagstaff, waited on the earth. All the Kurus and the Charanas highly<br>applauded that attempt of Bhima of snatching Karna away from his car,<br>like Garuda snatching away a snake. His bow cut off, himself deprived of<br>his car, Bhima, observant of the duties of his order, stood still for<br>battle, keeping his (broken) car behind him. The son of Radha, then, from<br>rage, in that encounter, proceeded against the son of Pandu who was<br>waiting for battle. Then those two mighty warriors, O king, challenging<br>as they approached each other, those two bulls among men, roared at each<br>other, like clouds at the close of summer. And the passage-at-arms that<br>then took place between those two engaged lions among men that could not<br>brook each other in battle resembled that of old between the gods and the<br>Danavas. The son of Kunti, however, whose stock of weapons was exhausted,<br>was (obliged to turn back) pursued by Karna. Beholding the elephants,<br>huge as hills that had been slain by Arjuna, lying (near), unarmed<br>Bhimasena entered into their midst, for impeding the progress of Karna's<br>car. Approaching that multitude of elephants and getting into the midst<br>of that fastness which was inaccessible to a car, the son of Pandu,<br>desirous of saving his life, refrained from striking the son of Radha.<br>Desirous of shelter, that subjugator of hostile cities viz., the son of<br>Pritha, uplifting an elephant that had been slain by Dhananjaya with his<br>shafts, waited there, like Hanumat uplifting the peak of<br>Gandhamadana.[165] Karna, however, with his shafts, cut off that elephant<br>held by Bhima. The son of Pandu, thereupon, hurled at Karna the fragments<br>of that elephant's body as also car-wheels and steeds. In fact, all<br>objects that he saw lying there on the field, the son of Pandu, excited<br>with rage, took up and hurled at Karna. Karna, however, with his sharp<br>arrows, cut off every one of those objects thus thrown at him. Bhima<br>also, raising his fierce fists that were endued with the force of the<br>thunder, desired to slay the Suta's son. Soon, however, he recollected<br>Arjuna's vow. The son of Pandu, therefore, though competent, spared the<br>life of Karna, from desire of not falsifying the vow that Savyasachin had<br>made. The Suta's son, however, with his sharp shafts, repeatedly caused<br>the distressed Bhima, to lose the sense. But Karna, recollecting the<br>words of Kunti, took not the life of the unarmed Bhima. Approaching<br>quickly Karna touched him with the horn of his bow. As soon, however, as<br>Bhimasena was touched with the bow, excited with rage and sighing like a<br>snake, he snatched the bow from Karna and struck him with it on the head.<br>Struck by Bhimasena, the son of Radha, with eyes red in wrath, smiling<br>the while, said unto him repeatedly these words, viz., 'Beardless eunuch,<br>ignorant fool and glutton.' And Karna said, 'Without skin in weapons, do<br>not fight with me. Thou art but a child, a laggard in battle! There, son<br>of Pandu, where occurs a profusion of eatables and drink, there, O<br>wretch, shouldst thou be but never in battle. Subsisting on roots,<br>flowers, and observant of vows and austerities, thou, O Bhima, shouldst<br>pass thy days in the woods for thou art unskilled in battle. Great is the<br>difference between battle and the austere mode of a Muni's life.<br>Therefore, O Vrikodara, retire into the woods. O child, thou art not fit<br>for being engaged in battle. Thou hast an aptitude for a life in the<br>woods. Urging cooks and servants and slaves in the house to speed, thou<br>art fit only for reproving them in wrath for the sake of thy dinner, O<br>Vrikodara! O Bhima, O thou of a foolish understanding, betaking thyself<br>to a Muni's mode of life, gather thou fruits (for thy food). Go to the<br>woods, O son of Kunti, for thou art not skilled in battle. Employed in<br>cutting fruits and roots or in waiting upon guests, thou art unfit, I<br>think, to take a part, O Vrikodara, in any passage-at-arms.' And, O<br>monarch, all the wrongs done to him in his younger years, were also<br>reminded by Karna in harsh words. And as he stood there in weakness,<br>Karna once more touched him with the bow. And laughing loudly, Vrisha<br>once more told Bhima those words, 'Thou shouldst fight with others, O<br>sire, but never with one like me. They that fight with persons like us<br>have to undergo this and else! Go thither where the two Krishnas are!<br>They will protect thee in battle. Or, O son of Kunti, go home, for, a<br>child as thou art, what business hast thou with battle?' Hearing those<br>harsh words of Karna, Bhimasena laughed aloud and addressing Karna said<br>unto him these words in the hearing of all, 'O wicked wight, repeatedly<br>hast thou been vanquished by me. How canst thou indulge, then, in such<br>idle boast? In this world the ancients witnessed the victory and defeat<br>of the great Indra himself. O thou of ignoble parentage, engage thyself<br>with me in an athletic encounter with bare arms. Even as I slew the<br>mighty Kichaka of gigantic frame, I would then slay thee in the very<br>sight of all kings.' Understanding the motives of Bhima, Karna, that<br>foremost of intelligent men, abstained from that combat in the very sight<br>of all the bowmen. Indeed, having made Bhima carless, Karna, O king,<br>reproved him in such boastful language in the sight of that lion among<br>the Vrishnis (viz., Krishna) and of the high-souled Partha. Then the<br>ape-bannered (Arjuna), urged by Kesava, shot at the Suta's son, O king,<br>many shafts whetted on stone. Those arrows adorned with gold, shot by<br>Partha's arms and issuing out of Gandiva, entered Karna's body, like<br>cranes into the Krauncha mountains. With those arrows shot from Gandiva<br>which entered Karna's body like so many snakes, Dhananjaya drove the<br>Suta's son from Bhimasena's vicinity. His bow cut off by Bhima, and<br>himself afflicted with the arrows of Dhananjaya, Karna quickly fled away<br>from Bhima on his great car. Bhimasena also, O bull among men, mounting<br>upon Satyaki's car, proceeded in that battle in the wake of his brother<br>Savyasachin, the son of Pandu. Then Dhananjaya, with eyes red in wrath,<br>aiming at Karna, quickly sped a shaft like the Destroyer urging forward<br>Death's self. That shaft shot from Gandiva, like Garuda in the welkin in<br>quest of a mighty snake, quickly coursed towards Karna. The son of Drona,<br>however, that mighty car-warrior, with a winged arrow of his, cut it off<br>in mid-air, desirous of rescuing Karna from fear of Dhananjaya. Then<br>Arjuna, excited with wrath, pierced the son of Drona with four and sixty<br>arrows, O king, and addressing him, said, 'Do not fly away, O Aswathaman,<br>but wait a moment.' Drona's son, however, afflicted with the shafts of<br>Dhananjaya, quickly entered a division of the Kaurava army that abounded<br>with infuriated elephants and teemed with cars. The mighty son of Kunti,<br>then, with the twang of Gandiva, drowned the noise made in that battle by<br>all other twangings of bows, of shafts decked with gold. Then, the mighty<br>Dhananjaya followed from behind the son of Drona who had not retreated to<br>a great distance, frightening him all the way with his shafts. Piercing<br>with his shafts, winged with the feathers of Kankas and peacocks, the<br>bodies of men and elephants and steeds, Arjuna began to grind that force.<br>Indeed, O chief of the Bharatas, Partha, the son of Indra, began to<br>exterminate that host teeming with steeds and elephants and men.'"
