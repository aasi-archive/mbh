                            "Narada said, 'Rama, the son of Dasaratha, O Srinjaya, we hear, fell a<br>prey to death. His subjects were as much delighted with him, as a sire is<br>delighted with the children of his loins. Endued with immeasurable<br>energy, countless virtues were there in him. Of unfading glory, Rama, the<br>elder brother of Lakshmana, at the command of his father, lived for<br>fourteen years in the woods, with his wife. That bull among men slew in<br>Janasthana fourteen thousand Rakshasas for the protection of the<br>ascetics. While dwelling there, the Rakshasa called Ravana, beguiling<br>both him and his companion (Lakshmana) abducted his wife, the princess of<br>Videha. Like the Three-eyed (Mahadeva), in days of old, slaying (the<br>Asura) Andhaka, Rama in wrath slew in battle that offender of Pulastya's<br>race who had never before been vanquished by any foe. Indeed, the<br>mighty-armed Rama slew in battle that descendant of Pulastya's race with<br>all his kinsmen and followers, that Rakshasa who was incapable of being<br>slain by the gods and the Asuras together, that wretch who was a thorn<br>unto the gods and the Brahmanas. In consequence of his affectionate<br>treatment of his subjects, the celestials worshipped Rama. Filling the<br>entire earth with his achievements, he was much applauded even by the<br>celestial Rishis. Compassionate unto all creatures, that king, having<br>acquired diverse realms and protected his subjects virtuously, performed<br>a great sacrifice without obstruction. And the lord, Rama, also performed<br>a hundred Horse-sacrifices and the great sacrifice called Jaruthya. And<br>with libations of clarified butter he contributed to Indra's delight.[96]<br>And by these acts of his, Rama conquered hunger and thirst, and all the<br>diseases to which living creatures are subject. Possessed of every<br>accomplishment, he always blazed forth with his own energy. Indeed, Rama,<br>the son of Dasaratha, greatly outshone all creatures. When Rama ruled his<br>kingdom, the Rishis, the gods, and men, all lived together on the earth.<br>The lives of living creatures were never otherwise. The life-breaths<br>also, called Prana, Apana, Samana, and the others, when Rama ruled his<br>kingdom, all performed their functions. All luminous bodies shone<br>brighter, and calamities never occurred. All his subjects were<br>long-lived. None died in youth. The dwellers of heaven highly gratified,<br>used to get, according to (the ordinances of) the four Vedas, libations<br>of clarified butter and other offerings of food made by men. His realms<br>were free from flies and gnats; and of beasts of prey and poisonous<br>reptiles, there were none. And none was of unrighteous tendencies, none<br>was covetous, and none was ignorant. The subjects, of all the (four)<br>orders, were engaged in righteous and desirable acts, When the Rakshasas,<br>about this time obstructed the offerings to the Pitris and the worship of<br>the gods in Janasthana, Lord Rama, slaying them, caused those offerings<br>and that worship to be once more given to the Pitris  and the gods. Men<br>were each blessed with a thousand children, and the period of their lives<br>was a thousand years. Seniors had never to perform Sraddhas of their<br>juniors.[97] Youthful in shape, of a dark-blue hue, of red eyes,<br>possessed of the tread of an infuriated elephant, with arms reaching down<br>to the knees, and beautiful and massive, of leonine shoulders, of great<br>strength, and beloved by all creatures, Rama ruled his kingdom for eleven<br>thousand years. His subjects always uttered his name. While Rama ruled<br>his kingdom, the world became extremely beautiful. Taking at last his<br>four kinds of subjects[98] with him Rama went to heaven, having<br>established his own line consisting of eight houses on the earth. When<br>even he died, O Srinjaya, who was superior to thee in respect of the four<br>cardinal virtues and superior to thy son, thou shouldst not lament,<br>saying 'Oh, Swaitya, Oh, Swaitya,' for thy son who performed no sacrifice<br>and made no sacrificial present.'"
