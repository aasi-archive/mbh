                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then that bull of Vrishni's race, viz., the high-souled<br>Satyaki of great intelligence, having slain Sudarsana, once more<br>addressed his driver, saying, Having forded through the almost unfordable<br>ocean of Drona's division, teeming with cars and steeds and elephants,<br>whose waves are constituted by arrows and darts, fishes by swords and<br>scimitars and alligators by maces, which roar with the whiz of shafts and<br>the clash of diverse weapons,&#8212;an ocean that is fierce and destructive of<br>life, and resounds with the noise of diverse musical instruments, whose<br>touch is unpleasant and unbearable to warriors of victory, and whose<br>margin is infested with fierce cannibals represented by the force of<br>Jalasandha.&#8212;I think, the portion of the array that remains may easily be<br>forded like a poor stream of shallow water. Urge thou the steeds,<br>therefore, without fear. I think, I am very near to Savyasachin. Having<br>vanquished in battle the invincible Drona with his followers, and that<br>foremost of warriors, viz., the son of Hridika, I think, I cannot be<br>distant from Dhananjaya. Fear never comes to my heart even if I behold<br>countless foes before me. These to me are like a heap of straw and grass<br>to a blazing conflagration in the woods. Behold, the track by which the<br>diadem-decked (Arjuna), that foremost one among the Pandavas, hath gone,<br>is rendered uneven with large bodies of foot-soldiers and steeds and<br>car-warriors and elephants lying slain on the ground. Behold, routed by<br>that high-souled warrior, the Kaurava army is flying away. Behold, O<br>charioteer, a dark brown dust is raised by those retreating cars and<br>elephants and steeds. I think, I am very near to Arjuna of white steeds<br>having Krishna for his charioteer. Hark, the well-known twang of Gandiva<br>of immeasurable energy is being heard. From the character of the omens<br>that appear to my view, I am sure that Arjuna will slay the ruler of the<br>Sindhus before the sun sets. Without causing their strength to be spent,<br>urge the steeds slowly to where those hostile ranks are staying, that is,<br>to where yonder warriors headed by Duryodhana, their hands cased in<br>leathern fences, and yonder Kamvojas of fierce deeds, clad in mail and<br>difficult of being defeated in battle, and those Yavanas armed with bow<br>and arrows and skilled in smiting, and under Sakas and Daradas and<br>Barbaras and Tamraliptakas, and other countless Mlecchas, armed with<br>diverse weapons, are,&#8212;to the spot (I repeat) where, indeed, yonder<br>warriors headed by Duryodhana, their hands cased in leathern fences,&#8212;are<br>waiting with their faces turned towards me and inspired with the<br>resolution of battling with me. Regard me to have already passed through<br>this fierce fastness, O Suta, having slain in battle all these combatants<br>with cars and elephants and steeds and foot-soldiers that are amongst<br>them.'<br><br>"The charioteer, thus addressed, said, 'O thou of Vrishni's race, fear I<br>have none, O thou of prowess that cannot be baffled! If thou hast before<br>the Jamadagni's son himself in wrath, or Drona, that foremost of<br>car-warriors, or the ruler of the Madras himself, even then fear doth not<br>enter my heart, O thou of mighty arms, as long as I am under the shadow<br>Of thy protection, O slayer of foes, countless Kamvojas, clad in mail, of<br>fierce deeds, and difficult to defeat in battle, have already been<br>vanquished by thee, as also many Yavanas armed with bow and arrows and<br>accomplished in smiting, including Sakas and Daradas and Tamraliptakas,<br>and many other Mlecchas armed with various weapons. Never before did I<br>experience fear in any battle. Why shall I, therefore, O thou of great<br>courage, experience any fear in this miserable fray? O thou that art<br>blessed with length of days, by which way shall I take thee to where<br>Dhananjaya is? With whom hast thou been angry, O thou of Vrishni's race?<br>Who are they that will fly away from battle, beholding thee endued with<br>such a prowess, resembling the Destroyer himself as he appears at the end<br>of the Yuga, and putting forth that prowess of thine (against thy foes)?<br>O thou of mighty arms, who are they of whom king Vaivaswata is thinking<br>today?'<br><br>"Satyaki said, 'Like Vasava destroying the Danavas, I shall slay these<br>warriors with shaved heads. By slaying these Kamvojas I will fulfil my<br>vow. Bear me thither. Causing a great carnage amongst these, I shall<br>today repair to the dear son of Pandu. The Kauravas, with Suyodhana at<br>their head, will today behold my prowess, when this division of Mlecchas,<br>of shaved heads, will have been exterminated and the whole Kaurava army<br>put to the greatest distress. Hearing the loud wails of the Kaurava host,<br>today, mangled and broken by me in battle Suyodhana will be inspired with<br>grief. Today, I shall show unto my preceptor, the high-souled Pandava, of<br>white steeds, the skill in weapons acquired by me from him. Beholding<br>today thousands of foremost warriors slain with my arrows, king<br>Duryodhana will be plunged into great grief. The Kauravas will today<br>behold the bow in my hands to resemble a circle of fire when,<br>light-handed, I will stretch the bowstring for shooting my host of<br>shafts. Beholding the incessant slaughter of his troops today, their<br>bodies covered with blood and pierced all over with my shafts, Suyodhana<br>will be filled with grief. While I shall slay in wrath the foremost of<br>Kuru warriors, Suyodhana will today behold to count two Arjunas.<br>Beholding thousands of kings slain by me in battle, king Duryodhana will<br>be filled with grief in today's great battle. Slaying thousands of kings<br>today, I will show my love and devotion to those high-souled ones, viz.,<br>the royal sons of Pandu. The Kauravas will know today the measure of my<br>might and energy, and my gratefulness (to the Pandavas).'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed, the charioteer urged to their utmost<br>speed those well-trained coursers of delightful pace and of the hue of<br>the moon. Those excellent animals, endued with the speed of the wind or<br>thought, proceeded, devouring the very skies, and bore Yuyudhana to the<br>spot where those Yavanas were. Thereupon, the Yavanas, many in number and<br>endued with lightness of hands, approaching unretreating Satyaki, covered<br>him with showers of arrows. The rushing Satyaki, however, O king, cut off<br>by means of his own straight arrows, all those shafts and weapons of the<br>Yavanas. Inflamed with wrath, Yuyudhana. then, with his straight shafts<br>of great sharpness, winged with gold and vulture's feathers, cut off the<br>heads and arms of those Yavanas. Many of those arrows, again, piercing<br>through their coats of mail, made of iron and brass, entered the earth.<br>Struck by the brave Satyaki in that battle, the Mlecchas began to fall<br>down on the earth in hundreds, deprived of life. With his arrows shot in<br>continuous lines from his bow drawn to its fullest stretch, that hero<br>began to slay five, six, seven, or eight Yavanas at a time. Thousands of<br>Kamvojas, and Sakas, and Barbaras, were similarly slain by Satyaki.<br>Indeed, the grandson of Sini, causing a great carnage among thy troops,<br>made the earth impassable and miry with flesh and blood. The field of<br>battle was strewn with the head-gears of those robbers and their shaved<br>heads too that looked, in consequence of their long beards, like<br>featherless birds. Indeed, the field of battle covered with headless<br>trunks dyed all over with blood, looked beautiful like the welkin covered<br>with coppery clouds. Slain by Satwata by means of his straight shafts<br>whose touch resembled that of Indra's thunder, the Yavanas covered the<br>surface of the earth. The small remnant of those mail-clad troops<br>vanquished in battle, O king, by Satwata, becoming cheerless, their lives<br>on the point of being taken, broke and urging their steeds with goads and<br>whips to their utmost speed, fled from fear in all directions. Routing<br>the invincible Kamvoja host in battle, O Bharata, as also that host of<br>the Yavanas and that large force of the Sakas, that tiger among men who<br>had penetrated into thy army, viz., Satyaki, of prowess incapable of<br>being baffled, crowned with victory, urged his charioteer, saying,<br>'Proceed!' Beholding that feat of his in battle, never before achieved by<br>any one else, the Charanas and the Gandharvas applauded him highly.<br>Indeed, O king, the Charanas, as also thy warriors, beholding Yuyudhana<br>thus proceeded for aiding Arjuna, became filled with delight (at his<br>heroism).'
