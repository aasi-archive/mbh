                            "Sanjaya said, 'During the progress of that fierce and terrible battle,<br>when the world was enveloped with darkness and dust, O king, the<br>combatants, as they stood on the field, could not see one another. Those<br>foremost of Kshatriyas fought with each other, guided by conjectures and<br>the personal and other names (they uttered). And during the progress, O<br>lord, of that terrible carnage of car-warriors and elephants and steeds<br>and foot-soldiers[212], those heroes, viz., Drona and Karna and Kripa,<br>and Bhima and Prishata's son and Satwata, afflicted one another and the<br>troops of either party, O bull of Bharata's race. The combatants of both<br>armies, oppressed all around by those foremost of car-warriors, during<br>the hour of darkness, fled away on all sides. Indeed, the warriors, broke<br>and fled away in all directions with hearts perfectly cheerless. And as<br>they fled away in all directions, they underwent a great carnage.<br>Thousands of foremost car-warriors also, O king, slaughtered one another<br>in that battle. Unable to see anything in the dark, the combatants became<br>deprived of their senses. All this was the result of the evil counsels of<br>thy son. Indeed, at that hour when the world was enveloped in darkness,<br>all creatures, O Bharata, including even the foremost of warriors,<br>overcome with panic, were deprived of their senses in that battle.'[213]<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'What became the state of your mind then when,<br>afflicted by that darkness, ye all were deprived of your energy and<br>furiously agitated by the Pandavas! How also, O Sanjaya, when everything<br>was enveloped in darkness, did the Pandava troops as also mine once more<br>became visible?'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Then the remnant of the army (of the Katirava),<br>under the orders of their leaders, were once more disposed in (compact)<br>array. Drona placed himself at the van, and Salya at the rear. And<br>Drona's son and Sakuni, the son of Suvala, placed themselves on the right<br>and the left flanks. And king Duryodhana himself, O monarch, on that<br>night, busied himself in protecting all the troops. Cheering all the<br>foot-soldiers, O king, Duryodhana said unto them, 'Laying aside your<br>great weapons, take ye all blazing lamps in your hands.' Thus commanded<br>by that best of kings, the foot-soldiers joyfully took up burning lamps.<br>The gods and Rishis, Gandharvas and celestial Rishis, and the diverse<br>tribes of Vidyadharas and Apsaras, and Nagas and Yakshas and Uragas and<br>Kinnaras, stationed on the welkin also joyfully took up blazing lamps.<br>Many lamps, filled with sweet-scented oil, were seen to fall from the<br>Regents of the cardinal and the subsidiary points of the compass. For<br>Duryodhana's sake, many such were seen to come from Narada and Parvata in<br>especial, lighting up that darkness. The (Kaurava) army then, disposed in<br>compact array, looked resplendent, on that night with the light of those<br>lamps, the costly ornaments (on the persons of combatants), and the<br>blazing celestial weapons as those were shot or hurled by it. On each car<br>were placed five lamps, and on each infuriated elephant three.[214] And<br>upon each horse was placed a large lamp. Thus was that host lighted up by<br>the Kuru warriors.[215] Set in their places within a short time, those<br>lamps speedily lighted up thy army. Indeed, all the troops, thus made<br>radiant by the foot-soldiers with oil-fed lamps in their hands, looked<br>beautiful like clouds in the nocturnal sky illumined by flashes of<br>lightning. When the Kuru host had thus been illuminated, Drona, endued<br>with the effulgence of fire, scorching everything around, looked radiant,<br>O king, in his golden armour, like the midday sun of blazing ray. The<br>light of those lamps began to be reflected from the golden ornaments, the<br>bright cuirasses and bows, and the well-tempered weapons of the<br>combatants. And maces twined with strings, and bright Parighas, and cars<br>and shafts and darts, as they coursed along, repeatedly created, O<br>Ajamidha, by their reflection myriads of lamps. And umbrellas and<br>yak-tails and scimitars and blazing brands, O king, and necklaces of<br>gold, as these were whirled or moved, reflecting that light, looked<br>exceedingly beautiful. Illuminated by the light of those lamps and<br>irradiated by the reflection from weapons and ornaments, that host, O<br>king, blazed up with splendour. Well-tempered and beautiful weapons, red<br>with blood, and whirled by heroes, created a blazing effulgence there,<br>like flashes of lightning in the sky at the end of summer. The faces of<br>warriors, impetuously pursuing foes for striking them down and themselves<br>trembling in the ardour of the rush, looked beautiful like masses of<br>clouds urged on by the wind. As the splendour of the sun becomes fierce<br>on the occasion of the conflagration of a forest full of trees, even so<br>on that terrible night became the splendour of that fierce and<br>illuminated host. Beholding that host of ours illumined, the Parthas<br>also, with great speed, stirring up the foot-soldiers throughout their<br>army, acted like ourselves. On each elephant, they placed seven lamps; on<br>each car, ten; and on the back of each steed they placed two lamps; and<br>on the flanks and rear (of their cars) and on their standard also, they<br>placed many lamps. And on the flanks of their host, and on the rear and<br>the van, and all around and within, many other lamps were lighted. The<br>Kurus having done the same, both the armies were thus lighted. Throughout<br>the host, the foot-soldiers became mingled with elephants and cars and<br>cavalry. And the army of Pandu's son was also illuminated by others (than<br>foot-soldiers) standing with blazing torches in their hands.[216] With<br>those lamps that host became fiercely effulgent, like a blazing fire made<br>doubly resplendent by the dazzling rays of the maker of day. The<br>splendour of both the armies, over-spreading the earth, the welkin, and<br>all the points of the compass, seemed to increase. With that light, thy<br>army as also theirs became distinctly visible. Awakened by that light<br>which reached the skies, the gods, the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, the<br>Rishis and other crowned with (ascetic) success, and the Apsaras, all<br>came there. Crowded then with gods and Gandharvas, and Yakshas, and<br>Rishis crowned with (ascetic) success, and Apsaras, and the spirits of<br>slain warriors about to enter the celestial regions, the field of battle<br>looked like a second heaven. Teeming with cars and steeds and elephants,<br>brilliantly illumined with lamps, with angry combatants and horses slain<br>or wandering wildly, that vast force of arrayed warriors and steeds and<br>elephants looked like the arrays of the celestials and the Asuras in days<br>of old. The rush of darts formed the fierce winds; great cars, the cloud;<br>the neigh and grunt of steeds and elephants, the roars; shafts, the<br>showers; and the blood of warriors and animals, the flood, of that<br>tempest like nocturnal encounter between those god-like men. In the midst<br>of that battle, that foremost of Brahmanas, viz., the high-souled<br>Aswatthaman, scorching the Pandavas, O ruler of men, resembled the midday<br>sun at the end of the season of rains, scorching everything with his<br>fierce ray.'"[217]
