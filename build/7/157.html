                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding that vast host of the Pandavas swelling with<br>rage and regarding it to be incapable of being resisted, thy son<br>Duryodhana. addressing Karna, said these words, 'O thou that art devoted<br>to friends, that hour hath now come in respect of thy friends (when thy<br>help is most needed). O Karna, save in battle all my warriors. Our<br>combatants are now encompassed on all sides by the Panchalas, the<br>Kaikeyas, the Matsyas, and the mighty car-warriors of the Pandavas, all<br>filled, with rage and resembling hissing snakes. Yonder the Pandavas,<br>solicitous of victory, are roaring in joy. The vast car-force of the<br>Panchalas is possessed of the prowess of Sakra himself.'<br><br>"Karna replied, 'If Purandara himself were to come hither for saving<br>Partha, quickly vanquishing even him, I would slay that son or Pandu. I<br>tell thee truly. Be cheered, O Bharata! I will slay the son of Pandu and<br>all the assembled Panchalas, I will give thee victory, like Pavaka's son<br>giving victory unto Vasava. I shall do what is agreeable to thee in this<br>battle that has begun. Amongst all the Parthas, Phalguna is the<br>strongest. At him I will hurl the fatal dart of Sakra's workmanship. Upon<br>the death of that great bowman, his brothers, O giver of honour, will<br>either surrender themselves unto thee or once more retire into the<br>forest. When I am alive, O Kauravya, never indulge in any grief. I will<br>vanquish in battle all the Pandavas united together and all the<br>Panchalas, the Kaikeyas, and the Vrishnis assembled together. Making<br>porcupines of them by means of my arrowy showers, I will give thee the<br>earth.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'While Karna was uttering those words, Kripa, the<br>mighty armed son of Saradwat, smiling the while, addressed the Suta's son<br>in these words, 'Thy speech is fair, O Karna! If words alone could lead<br>to success, then with thee, O son of Radha, as his protector, this bull<br>among the Kurus would be considered to have the amplest measure of<br>protection. Thou boastest much, O Karna, in the presence of the Kuru<br>chief, but thy prowess is seldom witnessed, nor, indeed, any result (of<br>thy boastful speeches). Many a time have we seen thee encounter the sons<br>of Pandu in battle. On every one of those occasions, O Suta's son, thou<br>hast been vanquished by the Pandavas. While Dhritarashtra's son was being<br>taken away (as a captive) by the Gandharvas, all the troops fought on<br>that occasion except thy single self, who was the first to fly away. In<br>Virata's city also, all the Kauravas, united together, including thyself<br>and thy younger brother were vanquished by Partha in battle. Thou art not<br>a match for even one of the sons of Pandu, viz., Phalguna, on the field<br>of battle. How then canst thou venture to vanquish all the sons of Pandu<br>with Krishna at their head? Thou indulgest in too much brag, O Suta's<br>son! Engage thyself in battle without saying anything. To Put forth<br>prowess without indulging in brag is the duty of good men. Ever roaring<br>aloud, O Suta's son like the dry clouds of autumn, thou showest thyself,<br>O Karna to be without substance. The king, however, does not understand<br>it. Thou roarest, O son of Radha, as long as thou seest not the son of<br>Pritha. These thy roars disappear when thou seest Partha near. Indeed,<br>thou roarest as long as thou art out of the range of Phalguna's shafts.<br>Those roars of thine disappear when thou art pierced with Partha's<br>shafts. Kshatriyas evince their eminence by means of their arms;<br>Brahmanas, by means of speech; Arjuna evinces his by means of the bow;<br>but Karna, by the castles he builds in the air. Who is there that will<br>resist that Partha who gratified Rudra himself (in battle)?' Thus railed<br>at by Saradwat's son, Karna, that foremost of smiters, answered Kripa in<br>the following strain, 'Heroes always roar like clouds in the season of<br>rains, and like steeds put in the soil, quickly yield fruits. I do not<br>see any fault in heroes that take great burdens on their shoulders,<br>indulging in boastful speeches on the field of battle. When a person<br>mentally resolves to bear a burden, Destiny itself aids him in the<br>execution. Wishing in my heart bear a great burden, I always summon<br>sufficient resolution. If, slaying the sons of Pandu with Krishna and<br>Satwatas in battle, I indulge in such roars, what is it to thee, O<br>Brahmana? They that are heroes never roar fruitlessly like autumnal<br>clouds. Conscious of their own might, the wise indulge in roars! In my<br>heart I am determined to vanquish in battle today Krishna and Partha<br>united together and fighting with resolution! It is for this that I roar,<br>O son of Gotama! Behold the fruit of these my roars, O Brahmana! Slaying<br>the son of Pandu in battle, with all their followers, Krishna and<br>Satwatas, I will bestow on Duryodhana the whole earth without a thorn in<br>it.'<br><br>"Kripa said, 'Little do I reckon, O Suta's son, these delirious saying of<br>thine discovering thy thoughts, not deeds. Thou always speakest in<br>depreciation of the two Krishnas and king Yudhishthira the just. He, O<br>Karna, is certain, to have the victory who hath on his side those two<br>heroes skilled in battle. Indeed, Krishna and Arjuna are incapable of<br>being defeated by the celestials, the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, human<br>beings, the Nagas, and the birds, all clad in mail. Yudhishthira, the son<br>of Dharma is devoted to the Brahmanas. He is truthful in speech and<br>self-restrained. He reverences the Pitris and the deities. He is devoted<br>to the practice of truth and righteousness. He is, again, skilled in<br>weapons. Possessed of great intelligence, he is also grateful. His<br>brothers are all endued with great might and well-practised in all<br>weapons. They are devoted to the service of their seniors. Possessed of<br>wisdom and fame, they are also righteous in their practices. Their<br>kinsmen and relatives are all endued with the prowess of Indra. Effectual<br>smiters, they are all exceedingly devoted to the Pandavas.<br>Dhrishtadyumna, and Sikhandin and Janamejaya, the son of Durmuksha and<br>Chandrasen, and Madrasen, and Kritavarman, Dhruva, and Dhara and<br>Vasuchandra, and Sutejana, the sons of Drupada, and Drupada himself,<br>conversant with high and mighty weapons, and the king of the Matsyas<br>also, with his younger brothers, all resolutely struggling for their<br>sake, and Gajanika, and Virabhadra, and Sudarsana, and Srutadhwaja, and<br>Valanika, and Jayanika, and Jayaprya, and Vijaya and Labhalaksha, and<br>Jayaswa, and Kamaratha, and the handsome brothers of Virata, and the<br>twins (Nakula and Sahadeva), and the (five) sons of Draupadi, and the<br>Rakshasa Ghatotkacha, are all fighting for the Pandavas. The sons of<br>Pandu, therefore, will not meet with destruction. These and many other<br>hosts (of heroes) are for the sons of Pandu. Without doubt, the entire<br>universe, with the celestials, Asuras, and human beings, with all the<br>tribes of Yaksha and Rakshas and with all the elephants and snakes and<br>other creatures, can be annihilated by Bhima and Phalguna by the prowess<br>of their weapons. As regards Yudhishthira also, he can, with angry eyes<br>only, consume the whole world. How, O Karna, canst thou venture to<br>vanquish those foes in battle for whom Sauri of immeasurable might hath<br>clad himself in mail? This, O Suta's son, is a great folly on thy part,<br>since thou always venturest to contend with Sauri himself in battle.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed (by Kripa), Karna the son of Radha, O<br>bull of Bharata's race, smiling the while, said these words unto the<br>preceptor Kripa, the son of Saradwat, 'The words thou hast spoken about<br>the Pandavas, O Brahmana, are all true. These and many other virtues are<br>to be seen in the sons of Pandu. It is true also that the Parthas are<br>incapable of being vanquished by the very gods with Vasava at their head,<br>and the Daityas, the Yakshas, and the Rakshasas. For all that I will<br>vanquish the Parthas with the help of the dart given me by Vasava. Thou<br>knowest, O Brahmana, that the dart given by Sakra is incapable of being<br>baffled. With that I will slay Savyasachin in battle. Upon Arjuna's fall,<br>Krishna and the uterine brothers of Arjuna will never be able to enjoy<br>the (sovereignty of the) earth without Arjuna (to aid them). All of them,<br>therefore, will perish. This earth then, with her seas, will remain<br>subject to the chief of the Kurus, O Gautama, without costing him any<br>efforts. In this world everything, without doubt, becomes attainable by<br>policy. Knowing this, I indulge in these roars, O Gautama! As regards<br>thyself, thou art old, a Brahmana by birth, and unskilled in battle. Thou<br>bearest much love for the Pandavas. It is for this thou insultest me<br>thus. If, O Brahmana, thou tellest me again such words as these, I shall,<br>then, drawing out my scimitar, cut off thy tongue, O wretch! Thou<br>desirest, O Brahmana, to applaud the Pandavas, for frightening all the<br>troops and the Kauravas, O thou of wretched understanding! As regards<br>this also, O Gautama, listen to what I say. Duryodhana, and Drona, and<br>Sakuni, and Durmukha, and Jaya, and Duhsasana, and Vrishasena, and the<br>ruler of the Madras, and thyself too and Somadatta and Drona's son, and<br>Vivinsati,&#8212;all these heroes skilled in battle,&#8212;are here, clad in mail.<br>What foe is there, endued with even the prowess of Sakra, that would<br>vanquish these in battle? All those I have named a-e heroes, skilled in<br>weapons, endued with great might, solicitous of admission into heaven,<br>conversant with morality, and skilled in battle. They would stay the very<br>gods in fight. These will take their places on the field for slaying the<br>Pandavas, clad in mail on behalf of Duryodhana desirous of victory. I<br>regard victory to be dependent on destiny, even in the case of the<br>foremost of mighty men. When the mighty-armed Bhishma himself lieth<br>pierced with a hundred arrows, as also Vikarna, and Jayadratha, and<br>Bhurisravas, and Jaya, and Jalasandha, and Sudakshina, and Sala; that<br>foremost of car-warriors, and Bhagadatta of great energy, I say, when<br>these and many others, incapable of being easily vanquished by the very<br>gods, heroes all and mightier (than the Pandavas), lie on the field of<br>battle, slain by the Pandavas, what dost thou think, O wretch among men,<br>but that all this is the result of destiny? As regards them also, viz.,<br>the foes of Duryodhana, whom thou adorest, O Brahmana, brave warriors of<br>theirs, in hundreds and thousands, have been slain. The armies of both<br>the Kurus and the Pandavas are diminishing in numbers; I do not, in this,<br>behold the prowess of the Pandavas! With them, O lowest of men, whom thou<br>always regardest to be so mighty, I shall strive, to the utmost extent of<br>my might, to contend in battle, for Duryodhana's good. As regards<br>victory, that depends on destiny.'"
