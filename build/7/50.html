                            "Sanjaya said, 'While Kunti's son, Yudhishthira, was indulging in such<br>lamentations, the great Rishi Krishna Dwaipayana came to him. Worshipping<br>him duly, and causing him to be seated, Yudhishthira, afflicted with<br>grief on account of the death of his brother's son, said, 'Alas, while<br>battling with many mighty bowmen, the son of Subhadra, surrounded by<br>several great car-warriors of unrighteous propensities, hath been slain<br>on the field. The slayer of hostile heroes, the son of Subhadra, was a<br>child in years and of childish understanding.[82] He fought in battle<br>against desperate odds. I asked him to open a passage for us in battle.<br>He penetrated within the hostile army, but we could not follow him,<br>obstructed by the ruler of the Sindhus. Alas, they that betake themselves<br>to battle as a profession, always fight with antagonists equally<br>circumstanced with themselves. This battle, however, that the enemy<br>fought with Abhimanyu, was an extremely unequal one. It is that which<br>grieves me greatly and draws tears from me. Thinking of this, I fail to<br>regain peace of mind.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'The illustrious Vyasa, addressing Yudhishthira who<br>was indulging in such lamentations and who was thus unmanned by an<br>accession of sorrow, said these words.'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'O Yudhishthira, O thou of great wisdom, O thou that art<br>master of all branches of knowledge, persons like thee never suffer<br>themselves to be stupefied by calamities. This brave youth, having slain<br>numerous foes hath ascended to heaven. Indeed, that best of persons,<br>(though a child), acted, however, like one of matured years. O<br>Yudhishthira, this law is incapable of being transgressed. O Bharata,<br>Death takes all viz., Gods and Dhanavas and Gandharvas (without<br>exception).'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Alas, these lords of earth, that lie on the bare<br>earth, slain in the midst of their forces, bereft of consciousness, were<br>possessed of great might. Others (of their class) possessed strength<br>equal to that of ten thousand elephants. Others, again, were endued with<br>the impetuosity and might of the very wind. They have all perished in<br>battle, slain by men of their own class. I do not behold the person (save<br>one of their own class) who could slay any of them in battle. Endued with<br>great prowess, they were possessed of great energy and great might. Alas,<br>they who used daily to come to battle with this hope firmly implanted in<br>their hearts, viz., that they would conquer, alas even they, possessed of<br>great wisdom, are lying on a field, struck (with weapons) and deprived of<br>life. The significance of the word Death hath today been made<br>intelligible, for these lords of earth, of terrible prowess, have almost<br>all been dead. Those heroes are lying motionless; reft of vanity, having<br>succumbed to foes. Many princes, filled with wrath, have been victimised<br>before the fire (of their enemies' wrath). A great doubt possesses me,<br>viz., whence is Death? Whose (offspring) is Death? What is Death? Why<br>does Death take away creatures? O grandsire, O thou that resemblest a<br>god, tell me this.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Unto Kunti's son, Yudhishthira, asking him thus, the<br>illustrious Rishi, comforting him, said these words.'<br><br>"Vyasa said, As regards the matter in hand, O king, this ancient story of<br>what Narada had in days of old said unto Akampana is cited. King<br>Akampana, O monarch, I know, while in this world was afflicted with very<br>great and unbearable grief on account of the death of his son, I will now<br>tell these the excellent story about the origin of Death. Having listened<br>to it, thou wilt be emancipated from sorrow and the touch of affection's<br>tie. Listen to me, O sire, as I recite this ancient history. This history<br>is, indeed, excellent. It enhanceth the period of life, killeth grief and<br>conduceth to health. It is sacred, destructive of large bodies of foes,<br>and auspicious of all auspicious things. Indeed, this history is even as<br>the study of the Vedas. O monarch, it should every morning be listened to<br>by the foremost of kings who are desirous of longlived children and their<br>own good.<br><br>"In days of old, O sire, there was a king named Akampana. Once, on the<br>field of battle, he was surrounded by his foes and nearly overpowered by<br>them. He had a son who was called Hari. Equal to Narayana himself in<br>might, that latter was exceedingly handsome, accomplished in weapons,<br>gifted with great intelligence, possessed of might, resembled Sakra<br>himself in battle. Encompassed by countless foes on the field of battle,<br>he sped thousands of shafts at those warriors and the elephants that<br>surrounded him. Having achieved the most difficult feats in battle, O<br>Yudhishthira, that scorcher of foes was, at last, slain in the midst of<br>the army. Performing the obsequies of his son, king Akampana cleansed<br>himself.[83] Grieving, however, for his son day and night, the king<br>failed to regain happiness of mind. Informed of his grief on account of<br>the death of his son, the celestial Rishi Narada came to his presence.<br>The blessed king, beholding the celestial Rishi, told the latter<br>everything that had happened unto him, viz., his defeat at the hands of<br>his foes, and the slaughter of his son. And the king said, 'My son was<br>endued with great energy, and equalled Indra or Vishnu himself in<br>splendour. That mighty son of mine, having displayed his prowess on the<br>field against countless foes was at last slain! O illustrious one, who is<br>this Death? What is the measure of his energy, strength and prowess? O<br>foremost of intelligent persons, I desire to hear all this truly.'<br>Hearing these words of his, the boon giving lord, Narada., recited the<br>following elaborate history, destructive of grief on account of a son's<br>death.'<br><br>"Narada said. 'Listen, O mighty-armed king, to this long history, exactly<br>as I have heard it, O monarch! In the beginning, the Grandsire Brahma<br>created all creatures. Endued with mighty energy, he saw that the<br>creation bore no signs of decay. Thereat, O king, the Creator began to<br>think about the destruction of the universe. Reflecting on the matter, O<br>monarch, the Creator failed to find any means of destruction. He then<br>became angry, and in consequence of his anger a fire sprang from the sky.<br>That fire spread in all directions for consuming everything of the<br>universe. Then heaven, sky, and earth, all became filled with fire. And<br>thus the Creator began to consume the whole mobile and immobile universe.<br>Thereby all creatures, mobile and immobile, were destroyed. Indeed, the<br>mighty Brahma, frightening everything by the force of his wrath, did all<br>this, Then Hara, otherwise called Sthanu or Siva, with matted locks on<br>his head, that Lord of all wanderers of the night, appealed to the divine<br>Brahma, the Lord of the gods. When Sthanu fell (at Brahma's feet) from a<br>desire of doing good to all creatures, the Supreme Deity to that greatest<br>of ascetics, blazing with splendour, said, 'What wish of thine shall we<br>accomplish, O thou that deservest to have all thy wishes fulfilled? O<br>thou that hast been born of our wish! We shall do all that may be<br>agreeable to thee! Tell us, O Sthanu, what is thy wish?'"
