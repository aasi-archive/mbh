                            "Sanjaya said, 'Hearing these words of Arjuna, the mighty car-warriors<br>present there said not a single word, O monarch, agreeable or<br>disagreeable, unto Dhananjaya. Then the mighty-armed Bhimasena, filled<br>with wrath, O bull of Bharata's race, reproaching Kunti's son, Arjuna,<br>said these words, 'Thou preachest truths of morality like an anchorite<br>living in the woods or a Brahmana of rigid vows and senses under complete<br>control. A person is called a Kshatriya because he rescues others from<br>wounds and injuries. Being such, he must save himself from wounds and<br>injuries. Showing forgiveness towards the three that are good (viz., the<br>gods, the Brahmanas, and preceptor), a Kshatriya, by doing his duties,<br>soon wins the earth as also piety and fame and prosperity.[262] Thou, O<br>perpetuator of thy race, art endued with every attribute of a Kshatriya.<br>It does not, therefore, look well for thee to speak like an ignorant<br>wight. O son of Kunti, thy prowess is like that of Sakra himself, the<br>lord of Sachi. Thou dost not transgress the bounds of morality like the<br>ocean that never transgresses its continents. Who is there that would not<br>worship thee, seeing that thou seekest virtue, having abandoned the wrath<br>cherished by thee for thirteen years? By good luck, O sire, thy heart<br>today followeth in the wake of virtue. O thou of unfading glory, by good<br>luck, thy understanding inclineth towards compassion. Though, however,<br>thou art inclined to adopt the path of virtue, thy kingdom was snatched<br>from thee most unrighteously. Dragging the wife Draupadi to the assembly,<br>thy foes insulted her. Clad in barks of trees and skins of animals, all<br>of us were exiled to the woods, and though we were undeserving of that<br>plight, our foes nevertheless compelled us to endure it for thirteen<br>years. O sinless one, thou hast forgiven all these circumstances, every<br>one of which demands the exhibition of wrath. Wedded as thou art to<br>duties of a Kshatriya, thou hast quietly borne these. Remembering all<br>those acts of unrighteousness, I came here with thee for avenging myself<br>of them. (When, however, I see that thou art so indifferent, why), I<br>myself will slay those low wretches that despoiled us of our kingdom.<br>Thou hadst formerly said these words, viz., Addressing ourselves to<br>battle, we will exert to the utmost extent of our abilities. Today,<br>however, thou reproachest us. Thou now seekest, virtue. Those words,<br>therefore, that thou saidst formerly were untrue. We are already<br>afflicted with fear. Thou cuttest, however, the very core of our hearts<br>with these thy words, O crusher of foes, like one pouring acid upon the<br>sores of wounded men. Afflicted with thy wordy darts, my heart is<br>breaking. Thou art virtuous, but thou dost not know in what righteousness<br>truly consists, since thou applaudest neither thyself nor us, though all<br>of us are worthy of applause. When Kesava himself is here, praisest thou<br>the son of Drona, a warrior that does not come up to even a sixteenth<br>part of thyself, O Dhanajaya, confessing thy own faults, why dost thou<br>not feel shame? I can rend asunder this earth in rage, or split the very<br>mountains in whirling that terrible and heavy mace of mine, decked with<br>gold. Like the tempest, I can break down gigantic trees looking like<br>hills. I can, with my arrows, rout the united celestials with Indra at<br>their head, together with all the Rakshasas, O Partha, and the Asuras,<br>the Uragas and human beings. Knowing me, thy brother, to be such, O bull<br>among men, it behoveth thee not, O thou of immeasurable prowess, to<br>entertain any fear about Drona's son. Or, O Vibhatsu, stand thou here,<br>with all these bulls amongst men. Alone and unsupported, I shall, armed<br>with my mace, vanquish this one in great battle.' After Bhima had ended,<br>the son of the Panchala king, addressing Partha, said these words, like<br>Hiranyakasipu (the leader of the Daityas) unto the enraged and roaring<br>Vishnu,[263] 'O Vibhatsu, the sages have ordained these to be the duties<br>of Brahmanas, viz., assisting at sacrifices, teaching, giving away,<br>performance of sacrifices, receiving of gifts, and study as the sixth. To<br>which of these six was that Drona devoted who has been stain by me?<br>Fallen off from the duties of his own order and practising those of the<br>Kshatriya order, that achiever of wicked deeds used to stay us by means<br>of superhuman weapons. Professing himself to be a Brahmana, he was in the<br>habit of using irresistible illusion. By an illusion itself hath he been<br>slain today. O Partha, what is there that is improper in this? Drona<br>having been thus punished by me, if his son, from rage, uttereth loud<br>roars, what do you lose by that? I do not think it at all wonderful that<br>Drona's son, urging the Kauravas to battle, will cause them to be slain,<br>unable to protect them himself. Thou art acquainted with morality. Why<br>then dost thou say that I am a slayer of my preceptor? It was for this<br>that I was born as a son to the king of the Panchalas, having sprung from<br>the (sacrificial) fire. How, O Dhananjaya, you call him a Brahmana or<br>Kshatriya, with whom, while engaged in battle, all acts, proper and<br>improper, were the same? O foremost of men, why should not he be slain,<br>by any means in our power, who, deprived of his senses in wrath, used to<br>slay with the Brahma weapons even those that were unacquainted with<br>weapons? He that is unrighteous is said by those that are righteous to be<br>equal to poison. Knowing this, O thou that art well versed with the<br>truths of morality, why dost thou, O Arjuna, reproach me? That cruel<br>car-warrior was seized and slain by me. I have done nothing that is<br>worthy of reproach. Why then, O Vibhatsu, dost thou not congratulate me?<br>O Partha, I have cut off that terrible head, like unto the blazing sun or<br>virulent poison or the all-destroying Yuga fire, of Drona. Why then dost<br>thou not applaud an act that is worthy of applause? He had slain in<br>battle only my kinsmen and not those of any one else. I say that having<br>only cut off his head, the fever of my heart hath not abated. The very<br>core of my heart is being pierced for my not having thrown that head<br>within the dominion of the Nishadas, like that of Jayadratha![264] It<br>hath been heard, O Arjuna, that one incurreth sin by not slaying his<br>foes. Even this is the duty of a Kshatriya, viz., to slay or be slain.<br>Drona was my foe. He hath been righteously slain by me in battle, O son<br>of Pandu, even as thou hast slain the brave Bhagadatta, thy friend.<br>Having slain thy grandsire in battle, thou regardest that act to be<br>righteous. Why then shouldst thou regard it unrighteous in me for my<br>having slain my wretched foe? In consequence of our relationship, O<br>Partha, I cannot raise my head in thy presence and am like a prostrate<br>elephant with a ladder against his body (for helping puny creatures to<br>get on his back). It, therefore, behoveth thee not to reproach me. I<br>forgive all the faults of thy speech, O Arjuna, for the sake of Draupadi<br>and Draupadi's children and not for any other reason. It is well known<br>that my hostility with the preceptor has descended from sire to son. All<br>persons in this world know it. Ye sons of Pandu, are ye not acquainted<br>with it? The eldest son of Pandu hath not been untruthful in speech. I<br>myself, O Arjuna, am not sinful. The wretched Drona was a hater of his<br>disciples. Fight now. Victory will be thine.'"
