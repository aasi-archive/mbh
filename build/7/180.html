                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding Hidimva's son slain and lying like a riven<br>mountain, all the Pandavas became filled with grief and began to shed<br>copious tears. Only Vasudeva filled with transports of delight, began to<br>utter leonine shouts, grieving the Pandavas. Indeed, uttering loud shouts<br>he embraced Arjuna. Tying the steeds and uttering loud roars, he began to<br>dance in a transport of joy, like a tree shaken by a tempest. Then<br>embracing Arjuna once more, and repeatedly slapping his own armpits,<br>Achyuta endued with great intelligence once more began to shout, standing<br>on the terrace of the car. Beholding those tokens of delight that Kesava<br>manifested, Dhananjaya, O king, with heart in grief, addressed him,<br>saying, 'O slayer of Madhu, thou showest great joy at a time scarcely fit<br>for it, indeed on an occasion for sorrow caused by the death of Hidimva's<br>son. Our troops are flying away, beholding Ghatotkacha slain. We also are<br>filled with anxiety in consequence of the fall of Hidimva's son. O<br>Janardana, the cause must be very grave when at such a time thou feelest<br>such joy. Therefore, O foremost of truthful men, asked by me, tell me<br>truly (what that cause is). Indeed, if it be not a secret, it behoveth<br>thee, O chastiser of foes, to say it unto me. O slayer of Madhu, tell me<br>what has removed thy gravity today. This act of thine, O Janardana, this<br>lightness of heart, seems to me like the drying up of the ocean or the<br>locomotion of Meru.'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, Great is the joy I feel. Listen to me, Dhananjaya! This<br>that I will tell thee will immediately dispel thy sorrow and infuse<br>delight into thy heart. O thou of great splendour, know, O Dhananjaya,<br>that Karna, his dart being baffled through Ghatotkacha, is already slain<br>in battle. The man does not exist in this world that could not stay<br>before Karna armed with that dart and looking like Kartikeya in battle.<br>By good luck, his (natural) armour had been taken away. By good luck, his<br>earrings also had been taken away. By good luck, his infallible dart also<br>is now baffled, through Ghatotkacha. Clad in (natural) coat of mail and<br>decked with his (natural) ear-rings, Karna, who had his senses under<br>control, could singly vanquish the three worlds with the very gods.<br>Neither Vasava, nor Varuna the lord of the waters, nor Yama, could<br>venture to approach him. Indeed, if that bull among men had his armour<br>and ear-rings, neither thyself, bending the Gandiva, nor myself,<br>uplifting my discus, called Sudarsana, could vanquish him in battle. For<br>thy good, Karna was divested of his ear-rings by Sakra with the help of<br>an illusion. Similarly was that subjugator of hostile towns deprived of<br>his (natural) armour. Indeed, because Karna, cutting off his (natural)<br>armour and his brilliant car-rings, gave them unto Sakra, it is for that<br>he came to be called Vaikartana. Karna now seems to me to be like an<br>angry snake of virulent poison stupefied by power of incantation, or like<br>a fire of mild flames. From that time, O mighty-armed one, when the<br>high-souled Sakra gave that dart unto Karna in exchange for the latter's<br>ear-rings, and celestial armour, that dart, viz., which has slain<br>Ghatotkacha, from that time, Vrisha, having obtained it, had always<br>regarded thee as slain in battle! But though deprived of that dart, O<br>sinless one, I swear to thee that hero is still incapable of being slain<br>by anybody else save thee. Devoted to Brahmanas, truthful in speech,<br>engaged in penances, observant of vows, kind even unto foes, for these<br>reasons Karna is called Vrisha. Heroic in battle, possessed of mighty<br>arms and with bow always uplifted, like the lion in the forest depriving<br>leaders of elephantine herds of their pride, Karna always deprives the<br>greatest car-warriors of their pride on the field of battle, and<br>resembles the mid-day sun at whom none can gaze. Contending with all the<br>illustrious and foremost of warriors of thy army, O tiger among men,<br>Karna, while shooting his arrowy showers, looked like the autumnal sun<br>with his thousand rays. Indeed, incessantly shooting showers of shafts<br>like the clouds pouring torrents of rain at the end of summer, Karna is<br>like a pouring cloud charged with celestial weapons. He is incapable of<br>being vanquished in battle by the gods, he would mangle them in such a<br>way that their flesh and blood would fall copiously on the field.<br>Deprived, however, of his armour as also of his car-rings, O son of<br>Pandu, and divested also of the dart given him by Vasava, Karna is now<br>like a man (and no longer like a god). There win occur one opportunity<br>for his slaughter. When his car-wheels will sink in the earth, availing<br>thyself of that opportunity, thou shouldst slay him in that distressful<br>situation. I will make thee a sign beforehand. Warned by it, thou<br>shouldst act. The vanquisher of Vala himself, that foremost of heroes,<br>wielding his thunder, is incapable of slaying the invincible Karna while<br>the latter stands weapon in hand. Indeed, O Arjuna, for thy good, with<br>the aid of diverse contrivances I have slain, one after another,<br>Jarasandha and the illustrious ruler of the Chedis and the mighty-armed<br>Nishada of the name of Ekalavya. Other great Rakshasas having Hidimva and<br>Kirmira and Vaka for their foremost, as also Alayudha, that grinder of<br>hostile troops, and Ghatotkacha, that crusher of foes and warrior of<br>fierce deeds, have all been slain.'"
