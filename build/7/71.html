                            "Vyasa said, 'Hearing this sacred history of sixteen kings, capable of<br>enhancing the period of life (of the listener), king Srinjaya remained<br>silent without saying anything. The illustrious Rishi Narada then said<br>unto him thus sitting silent, 'O thou of great splendour, hast thou heard<br>those histories recited by me, and hast thou caught their purport? Or,<br>are all these lost like Sraddha as performed by a person of regenerate<br>classes having a Sudra wife?' Thus addressed, Srinjaya then replied with<br>joined hands, 'O thou that hast wealth of asceticism, having listened to<br>these excellent and praiseworthy histories of ancient royal sages, all of<br>whom had performed great sacrifices with profuse presents unto the<br>Brahmanas, my grief hath all been dispelled by wonder, like the darkness<br>that is dispelled by the rays of the sun. I have now been cleansed of my<br>sins, and I do not feel any pain now. Tell me, what shall I do now?'<br><br>"Narada said, 'By good luck it is that thy grief hath been dispelled.<br>Solicit thou the boon that thou desirest. Thou wilt obtain all thou mayst<br>ask. We never say what is not true.'<br><br>"Srinjaya said, 'I am happy with even this, viz., that thou, O holy one,<br>art gratified with me. He with whom thou, O holy one, art gratified, hath<br>nothing unobtainable here.'<br><br>"Narada said, 'I will once more give thee thy son who was fruitlessly<br>slain by the robbers, like an animal, slaughtered in sacrifice, taking<br>him out of terrible hell.'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'Then the son of Srinjaya, of wonderful splendour, appeared,<br>that child resembling the son of Kuvera himself, bestowed by the<br>gratified Rishi (on the bereaved father). And king Srinjaya, once more<br>meeting with his son, became highly delighted. And he performed many<br>meritorious sacrifices, giving away profuse sacrificial presents upon<br>completion. Srinjaya's son had not fulfilled the purposes of his being.<br>He had performed no sacrifice and had no children. Destitute of bravery,<br>he had perished miserably and not in battle. It was for this reason that<br>he could be brought back into life.[123] As regards Abhimanyu, he was<br>brave and heroic. He hath fulfilled the purposes of life, for the brave<br>son of Subhadra, having blasted his foes by thousands, hath left the<br>world, falling in the field of battle. Those inaccessible regions that<br>are attainable by Brahmacharya, by knowledge, by acquaintance with the<br>scriptures, by foremost of sacrifices, even, these have been obtained by<br>thy son. Men of knowledge always desire heaven by their righteous deeds.<br>They that are living in heaven never prefer this world to heaven.<br>Therefore, it is not easy for any desirable thing that might have been<br>unattained by him to bring back into the world Arjuna's son slain in<br>battle and now residing in heaven. Thy son has attained to that eternal<br>goal which is attained by yogins with eyes shut in contemplation or by<br>performers of great sacrifices, or people possessed of great ascetic<br>merit. After death, attaining a new body that hero is shining like a king<br>in his own immortal rays. Indeed, Abhimanyu has once more got his own<br>body of lunar essence that is desirable by all regenerate persons. He<br>deserveth not thy grief.[124] Knowing this, be quiet, and slay thy foes.<br>Let fortitude be thine. O sinless one, it is the living that stand in<br>need of our grief, and not they that have attained to heaven. His sins<br>increase, O king, for whom, the living grieve. Therefore, he that is<br>wise, abandoning grief, should strive for (the) benefit (of the dead).<br>The living man should think of the joy, the glory, and the happiness (of<br>the dead). Knowing this, the wise never indulge in grief, for grief is<br>painful. Know this to be true. Rise up! Strive (to achieve thy purpose).<br>Do not grieve. Thou hast heard of the origin of Death, and her unexampled<br>penances, as also the impartiality of her behaviour towards all<br>creatures. Thou hast heard that prosperity is unstable. Thou hast heard<br>how the dead son of Srinjaya was revived. O learned king, do not grieve.<br>Peace be to thee, I go!'&#8212;Having said this, the holy Vyasa disappeared<br>then and there. Upon the departure of that master of speech, that<br>foremost of intelligent persons, viz., the holy Vyasa, whose colour was<br>like that of the clouded sky, Yudhishthira, having derived consolation in<br>consequence of what he had heard about the sacrificial merit and<br>prosperity of these great monarchs of olden times, possessed of energy<br>equal to that of the great Indra himself and all of whom had acquired<br>wealth by righteous means, mentally applauded those illustrious persons<br>and became freed from grief. Once more, however, with a melancholy heart<br>he asked himself, saying, 'What shall we say unto Dhananjaya?'"
