                            "Sanjaya said, 'Of fierce deeds in battle and above all fatigue, as<br>proved by their feats, five sons of Pandu, with Krishna, are incapable of<br>being resisted by the very gods. In righteousness, in deeds, in lineage,<br>in intelligence, in achievements, in fame, in prosperity, there never<br>was, and there never will be, another man so endued as Yudhishthira.<br>Devoted to truth and righteousness, and with passions under control, king<br>Yudhishthira, in consequence of his worship of the Brahmans and, diverse<br>other virtues of similar nature, is always in the enjoyment of Heaven.<br>The Destroyer himself at the end of the Yuga, Jamadagni's valiant son<br>(Rama), and Bhimasena on his car,&#8212;these three, O king, are spoken of as<br>equal. Of Partha, the wielder of Gandiva, who always achieveth his vows<br>in battle, I do not see a proper parallel on earth. Reverence for<br>superiors, keeping counsels, humility, self-restraint, beauty of person,<br>and bravery&#8212;these six&#8212;are ever present in Nakula. In knowledge of<br>scriptures, gravity, sweetness of temper, righteousness and prowess, the<br>heroic Sahadeva is equal to the Aswins themselves. All those noble<br>qualities that are in Krishna, all those that are in the Pandavas, all<br>that assemblage of qualities was to be found in Abhimanyu alone. In<br>firmness, he was equal to Yudhishthira, and in conduct to Krishna; in<br>feats, he was the equal to Bhimasena of terrible deeds, in beauty of<br>person, in prowess, and in knowledge of scriptures he was the equal to<br>Dhananjaya. In humility, he was equal to Sahadeva and Nakula.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'I desire, O Suta, to hear in detail, how the<br>invincible Abhimanyu, the son of Subhadra, hath been slain on the field<br>of battle.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Be still, O king! Bear thy grief that is so<br>unbearable. I shall speak to thee of the great slaughter of thy kinsmen.<br><br>"The preceptor, O king, had formed the great circular array. In it were<br>placed all the kings (of our side) that are each equal to Sakra himself.<br>At the entrance were stationed all the princes possessed of solar<br>effulgence. All of them had taken oaths (about standing by one another).<br>All of them had standards decked with gold. All of them were attired in<br>red robes, and all had red ornaments. All of them had red banners and all<br>were adorned with garlands of gold, smeared with sandal-paste and other<br>perfumed unguents; they were decked with floral wreaths. In a body they<br>rushed towards Arjuna's son, desirous of battle. Firm bowmen, all they<br>numbered ten thousand. Placing thy handsome grandson, Lakshmana, at their<br>head, all of them, sympathising with one another in joy and grief, and<br>emulating one another in feats of courage, desiring to excel one another,<br>and devoted to one another's good, they advanced to battle. Duryodhana, O<br>monarch, was stationed in the midst of his forces. And the king was<br>surrounded by the mighty car-warriors, Karna, Duhsasana, and Kripa, and<br>had a white umbrella held over his head. And fanned with yak tails, he<br>looked resplendent like the chief of the celestials. And at the head of<br>that army was the commander Drona looking like the rising sun.[62] And<br>there stood the ruler of the Sindhus, of great beauty of person, and<br>immovable like the cliff of Meru. Standing by the side of the ruler of<br>the Sindhus and headed by Aswatthaman, were, O king, thy thirty sons,<br>resembling the very gods. There also on Jayadratha's flank, were those<br>mighty car-warriors, viz., the ruler of Gandhara, i.e., the gamester<br>(Sakuni), and Salya, and Bhurisrava. Then commenced, the battle, fierce,<br>and making the hairs stand on their ends, between thy warriors and those<br>of the foe. And both sides fought, making death itself the goal.'"
