                            "Dhritarashtra said, Upon the slaughter of the Atiratha, viz., Drona, by<br>Prishata's son, what did my sons and the Pandavas next do?'<br><br>"Sanjaya, said, 'After the rout of the Kuru army, upon the slaughter of<br>that Atiratha, viz., Drona, by Prishata's son, Dhananjaya, the son of<br>Kunti beholding a wonderful phenomenon in connection with his own<br>victory, asked Vyasa, O bull of Bharata's race, who came thither in<br>course of his wanderings, saying, 'O great Rishi, while I was engaged in<br>slaying the foe in battle with showers of bright shafts, I continually<br>beheld before me, proceeding in advance of my car, a person of blazing<br>hue, as if endued with the effulgence of fire. Whithersoever he proceeded<br>with his uplifted lance, all the hostile warriors were seen to break<br>before him. Broken in reality by him, people regarded the foe to have<br>been broken by me. Following in his wake, I only destroyed those, already<br>destroyed by him. O holy one, tell me who was that foremost of persons,<br>armed with lance, resembling the sun himself in energy, that was thus<br>seen by me? He did not touch the earth with his feet, nor did he hurl his<br>lance even once. In consequence of his energy, thousands of lances issued<br>out of that one lance held by him.'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'Thou hast, O Arjuna, seen Sankara, that First cause from<br>which have sprung the Prajapatis, that puissant Being endued with great<br>energy, he that is the embodiment of heaven, earth and sky, the Divine<br>Lord, the protector of the universe, the great Master, the giver of<br>boons, called also Isana. O, seek the protection of that boon, giving<br>Deity, that lord of the universe. He is called Mahadeva (the Supreme<br>Deity), of Supreme Soul, the one only Lord, with matted locks (on head),<br>the abode of auspiciousness. Of three eyes and mighty arms, he is called<br>Rudra, with his locks tied in the shape of a crown, and his body attired<br>in skins. That boon-giving lord of the universe, that Supreme Deity, is<br>also called Hara and Sthanu. He is the foremost of every being in the<br>universe, he is incapable of being vanquished, he is the delighter of the<br>universe and its supreme ruler. The first cause, the light and refuge of<br>the universe, he is ever victorious. The Soul and the creator of the<br>universe, and having the universe for his form, he is possessed of great<br>fame. The Lord of the universe, and its great Ruler, that puissant one,<br>is also the master of all actions. Called also Sambhu, he is self-born,<br>he is the lord of all creatures, and the origin of the Past, the Future,<br>and the Present. He is Yoga and the lord of Yoga; he is called Sarva, and<br>is the Lord of all the worlds. He is superior to everything. The foremost<br>of everything in the universe, and the highest of all, he is called also<br>Parumesthin. The Ordainer of the three worlds, he is the sole refuge of<br>the three worlds. Incapable of being vanquished, he is the protector of<br>the universe, and abode (the necessity of) birth, decay, and death. The<br>Soul of knowledge, incapable of being compassed by knowledge, and the<br>highest of all knowledge he is unknowable. Through grace, he giveth unto<br>his worshippers the boons they desire. That Lord hath for his companions<br>celestial beings of diverse forms, some of whom are dwarfs, some having<br>matted locks, some with bald heads, some with short necks, some with<br>large stomachs, some with huge bodies, some possessed of great strength<br>and some of long ears. All of them, O Partha, have deformed faces and<br>mouths and legs and strange attires. That Supreme Deity, called Mahadeva,<br>is worshipped by followers that are even such. Even that Siva, O son,<br>endued with such energy, proceedeth through kindness, in advance of thee.<br>In that fierce battle, O Partha, making the very hair stand on end, who<br>else, O Arjuna, than the divine Maheswara, that foremost of all bowmen,<br>that Deity of divine form, could even in imagination venture to vanquish<br>that force which was protected by those great smiters and bowmen, viz.,<br>Aswatthaman and Karna and Kripa? None can venture to stay before the<br>warrior that hath Maheswara walking before him. There is no being in the<br>three worlds that is equal to him. And the very scent of the enraged<br>Mahadeva, foes in battle tremble and become senseless and fall in large<br>numbers. For this, the gods in heaven adore and bow to him. Those men in<br>this world and those other men of pious conduct, that devoutly worship<br>the boon-giving, divine, and auspicious Rudra, obtain happiness here and<br>attain to the highest state hereafter. O son of Kunti, bow down unto him<br>that is peace, unto him, called Rudra of blue throat, exceedingly subtle,<br>and of great effulgence, unto him called Kapardin, him that is terrible,<br>him that of tawny eyes, him that is boon-giving; unto that great<br>ordainer, of red locks and righteous conduct; unto him that always does<br>auspicious acts; unto him that is an object of desire; him that is of<br>tawny eyes; him that is called Sthanu; him that is called Purusha; unto<br>him that is of tawny hair; him that is bold, him that is exceedingly<br>subtle and of great effulgence; unto him that is the giver of light; him<br>that is the embodiment of all sacred waters; him that is the God of gods;<br>and him that is endued with great impetuosity; unto him that is of<br>manifest form; him that is called Sarva; him that is of agreeable attire;<br>unto him that has an excellent head-gear, him that is of handsome face;<br>him that has the mountains for his habitation; him that is peace; him<br>that is the protector; him that has barks of trees for his attire; him<br>whose arms are decked with ornaments of gold, him who is fierce, him that<br>is the lord of all the points of the compass; him that is the lord of the<br>clouds and of all created beings; him that is the lord of all trees and<br>of all kine; him that has his body shrouded with trees; him who is the<br>celestial generalissimo; him who inspires all thought; him who has the<br>sacrificial ladle in his hand; him who is blazing; him who wields the<br>bow; him who is Rama's self, him who has diverse forms; him who is the<br>lord of the universe; him who had the munja grass for his attire; him who<br>has a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, a thousand arms, and a thousand<br>legs. O son of Kunti, seek the protection of that boon-giving Lord of the<br>universe, the lord of Uma, that God of three eyes, that destroyer of<br>Daksha's sacrifice; that guardian of all created things, that being who<br>is always cheerful, that protector of all beings, that God of unfading<br>glory; that one with matted locks; that mover of all superior beings,<br>that one whose navel is like that of a bull and who hath the bull for his<br>symbol; that one who is proud like the bull, who is the lord of bulls;<br>who is represented by the horns of the bull; and who is the bull of<br>bulls; that one who hath the image of the bull on his banner; who is<br>liberal to all righteous persons; who can be approached by Yoga only; and<br>whose eyes are like those of a bull; who owneth very superior weapons:<br>who hath Vishnu himself for his arrow; who is the embodiment of<br>righteousness; and who is called Maheswara; who is of vast stomach and<br>vast body; who hath a leopard's skin for his seat; who is the lord of the<br>worlds; who is devoted to Brahma and who loveth Brahmanas; who is armed<br>with trident; who is boon-giving; who wieldeth the sword and the shield,<br>and who is highly auspicious, who wieldeth the bow called Pinaka, who is<br>divested of the battle axe,[273] and who is the protector and lord of the<br>universe. I place myself in the hands of that divine Lord, that grantor<br>of protection, that God attired in deer-skins. Salutations, to that Lord<br>of the celestials who hath Vaisravana for his friend. Salutations ever to<br>him of excellent vows; to him who hath excellent bowmen for his<br>companions; to him who himself wieldeth the bow; to that God with whom<br>the bow is a favourite weapon; who is himself the shaft impelled by the<br>bow; who is the bowstring and the bow; and the preceptor teaching the use<br>of the bow. Salutations to the God whose weapons are fierce; and who is<br>the foremost of all the gods. Salutations to him of diverse forms; to him<br>who hath many bowmen around him. Salutations ever to him who is called<br>Sthanu and who has a large number of excellent bowmen for his companions.<br>Salutations to him who destroyed the triple city. Salutations to him who<br>slew (the Asura) Bhaga. Salutations to him who is the lord of trees and<br>of men. Salutations to him who is the lord of the (celestial), Mothers,<br>and of those tribes of spirits known by the name of Ganas. Salutations<br>ever to him who is the lord of kine and of sacrifices. Salutations ever<br>to him who is the lord of the waters and the lord of the gods, who is the<br>destroyer of Surya's teeth, who is of three eyes, who is the grantor of<br>boons; who is called Hara, who is blue-throated, and who is of golden<br>locks. I will now tell thee, according to my knowledge and as I have<br>heard of them, all the divine deeds of Mahadeva of Supreme wisdom. If<br>Mahadeva becomes angry, neither gods, nor Asuras, Gandharvas, nor<br>Rakshasas, even if they hide themselves in deep oceans, can have peace.<br>In the days of yore, Daksha, for performing a sacrifice, had collected<br>the necessary articles. Mahadeva destroyed that sacrifice in wrath.<br>Indeed, He became very stern on that occasion. Shooting an arrow from his<br>bow, he uttered terrible roars. The celestials then became filled with<br>anxiety and fright. Indeed, when Mahadeva became angry and the Sacrifice<br>(in its embodied form) fled away, the gods became exceedingly frightened<br>at the twang of Mahadeva's bow and the sound of his palms. The gods and<br>Asuras all fell down and submitted to Mahadeva. All the waters swelled up<br>in agitations and the earth trembled. The mountains split, and all the<br>points of the compass and the Nagas became stupefied. The universe,<br>enveloped in a thick darkness, could no longer be seen. The splendour of<br>all luminaries, with the sun was destroyed. The Rishis, filled with fear,<br>became agitated, and desirous of their own good as also of all creatures,<br>performed propitiatory rites. Surya was then eating the principal<br>oblation. Smilingly Sankara approached him and tore out his teeth. The<br>gods then, humbling themselves to him, fled away, trembling. Once more,<br>Mahadeva aimed at the gods a shower of blazing and keen arrows resembling<br>flames of fire mixed with smoke, or clouds with lightning. Beholding that<br>arrowy shower, all the gods bowing down unto Maheswara, assigned to Rudra<br>a substantial share in sacrifices. In fright, the gods, O prince, sought<br>his protection. His wrath being dispelled, the great God then restored<br>the sacrifice. The gods that had fled away came back. Indeed, they are to<br>this day afraid of Maheswara. Formerly, the valiant Asuras had, in<br>heaven, three cities. Each of those cities was excellent and large. One<br>was made of iron, another of silver, and the third of gold. The golden<br>city belonged to Kamalaksha, the silver city to Tarakaksha, and the<br>third, made of iron, had Vidyunmalin for its lord. With all his weapons,<br>Maghavat (Indra) was unable to make any impression on those cities.<br>Afflicted (by the Asuras), all the gods sought the protection of Rudra.<br>Approaching him, all the gods with Vasava at their head, said, 'These<br>terrible dwellers of the triple city have received boons from Brahma.<br>Filled with pride in consequence of those boons, they are greatly<br>afflicting the universe, O Lord of the gods, none, save thee, is<br>competent to slay them. Therefore, O Mahadeva, slay these enemies of the<br>gods: O Rudra, creatures slain in every sacrifice shall then be thine.<br>Thus addressed by the gods, Mahadeva thus accepted their request, moved<br>by the desire of benefiting them, and said, 'I will overthrow these<br>Asuras. And Hara made the two mountains, viz., Gandhamadana and Vindhya,<br>the two poles of his car. And Sankara made the earth with her oceans and<br>forests his battle car. And the three-eyed deity made that prince of<br>snakes, viz., Sesha, the Aksha, of that car. And that God of gods, the<br>wielder of Pinaka, made the moon and the sun the two wheels of that<br>vehicle. And the triple-eyed Lord made Elapatra and Pushpadanta, the two<br>pins of the yoke. And the valiant Mahadeva made the Malaya mountains the<br>yoke, and the great Takshaka the string for tying the yoke to the poles,<br>and the creatures about him the traces of the steed. And Maheswara made<br>the four Vedas his four steeds. And that lord of the three worlds made<br>the supplementary Vedas the bridle-bits. And Mahadeva made Gayatri and<br>Savitri the reins, the syllable Om the whip, and Brahma the driver. And<br>making the Mandara mountains the bow, Vasuki the bowstring, Vishnu his<br>excellent shaft, Agni the arrow-head, and Vayu the two wings of that<br>shafts, Yama the feathers in its tail, lightning the whetting stone, and<br>Meru the standard, Siva, riding on that excellent car which was composed<br>of all the celestial forces, proceeded for the destruction of the triple<br>city. Indeed, Sthanu, that foremost of smiter, that Destroyer of Asuras,<br>that handsome warrior of immeasurable prowess, adored by the celestials,<br>O Partha, and by Rishis possessing wealth of asceticism, caused an<br>excellent and unrivalled array called after his own name, and stood<br>immovable for a thousand years. When, however, the three cities came<br>together in the firmament, the lord Mahadeva. pierced them with that<br>terrible shaft of his, consisting of three knots. The Danavas were unable<br>to gaze at that shafts inspired with Yuga-fire and composed of Vishnu and<br>Soma. While the triple city commenced to burn, the goddess Parvati<br>repaired thither to behold the sight. She had then on her lap, a child<br>having a bald head with five clumps of hair on it. The goddess asked the<br>deities as to who that child was. Sakra, through ill-feeling endeavoured<br>to strike that child with his thunderbolt. The divine lord Mahadeva (for<br>the child was none other), smiling, quickly paralysed the arm of the<br>enraged Sakra. Then god Sakra, with his arm paralysed accompanied by all<br>the celestials, speedily repaired to the lord Brahma of unfading glory.<br>Bowing unto him with their heads, they addressed Brahma with joined hands<br>and said, 'Some wonderful creature, O Brahma, lying on the lap of<br>Parvati, in the form of a child, was behold by us but not saluted. We<br>have all been vanquished by him. We, therefore, desire to ask thee as to<br>who he may be. Indeed, that boy, without fighting, hath with the greatest<br>ease vanquished us all with Purandara at our head.' Hearing these words<br>of theirs, Brahma. that foremost of all persons, acquainted with Brahma,<br>reflected for a moment and understood that boy of immeasurable energy to<br>be none else than the divine Sambhu, Addressing then, those foremost of<br>celestials with Sakra at their head, Brahma said, 'That child is the<br>divine Hara the Lord of the entire mobile and immobile universe. There is<br>nothing superior to Maheswara. That Being of immeasurable splendour who<br>was beheld by you all with Uma, that divine lord, had assumed the form of<br>a child for Uma's sake. Let us all go unto him. That divine and<br>illustrious one is the Supreme Lord of the world. Ye gods, ye could not<br>recognise that master of the universe.' Then all the gods with the<br>Grandsire repaired to that child, endued with the effulgence of the<br>morning sun. Beholding Maheswara, and knowing that he was the Supreme<br>Being, the Grandsire Brahma thus adored him: Thou art Sacrifice, O lord,<br>thou art the stay and refuge of the universe. Thou art Bhava, thou art<br>Mahadeva, thou art the abode (of all things), and thou art the highest<br>refuge. This whole universe with its mobile and immobile creatures, is<br>pervaded by thee. O holy one, O lord of the past and the future, O lord<br>of the world, O protector of the universe, let Sakra, afflicted with thy<br>wrath, have thy grace.'<br><br>"Vyasa continued, 'Hearing these words of the lotus-born Brahma,<br>Maheswara became gratified. Desirous of extending his grace, he laughed<br>aloud. The celestials then gratified (with praise) both Uma and Rudra.<br>The arm of the thunder-wielding Sakra re-got its natural state. That<br>foremost one of all the gods, that destroyer of Daksha's sacrifice, that<br>divine lord having the bull for his sign, became gratified with the gods.<br>He is Rudra he is Siva, he is Agni, he is everything, and he hath<br>knowledge of everything. He is Indra, he is the Wind, he is the twin<br>Aswins, and he is the lighting. He is Bhava, he is Parjanya, he is<br>Mahadeva, he is sinless. He is the Moon, he is Isana, he is Surya, he is<br>Varuna. He is Kala, he is Antaka, he is Mrityu, he is Yama.[274] He is<br>the day, and he is the night. He is the fortnight, he is the month, he is<br>the seasons. He is the morning and evening-twilights, he is the year. He<br>is Dhatri, he is Vidhatri, he is the Soul of the universe, and he is the<br>doer of all acts in the universe. Though himself without body, it is he<br>who is the embodied celestial. Endued with great splendour he is adored<br>and praised by all the gods. He is One, he is Many, he is hundred and<br>thousand. Brahmanas versed in the Vedas say that he hath two forms. These<br>are the terrible and the auspicious. These two forms, again, are<br>multifarious. His auspicious forms are water, light, and the moon.<br>Whatever is highly mysterious in the several branches of the Vedas, in<br>the Upanishads, in the Puranas, and in those sciences that deal with the<br>soul, is that God, viz., Maheswara, Mahadeva is even such. That God is,<br>again, without birth. All the attributes of that God are not capable of<br>being enumerated by me even if, O son of Pandu, I were to recite them<br>continually for a thousand years. Even unto those that are afflicted by<br>all the evil planets, even unto those that are stained with every sin,<br>that great protector, if they seek him, becomes gratified with them and<br>granteth them salvation. He granteth, and taketh away life and health and<br>prosperity and wealth and diverse kinds of objects of desire. The<br>prosperity is his that is seen in Indra and other gods. He is ever<br>engaged in the good and evil of men in this world. In consequence of his<br>supremacy, he can always obtain whatever objects he desires. He is called<br>Maheswara and is the lord of even the supreme ones. In many forms of many<br>kinds he pervadeth the universe. The mouth which that God has is in the<br>ocean. It is well-known that mouth, assuming the form of a mare's head,<br>drinketh the sacrificial libation in the shape of water. This god always<br>dwelleth in crematoriums. Men worship that Supreme lord in that place<br>where none but the courageous can go. Many are the blazing and terrible<br>forms of this God that men speak of and worship in the world. Many also<br>are the names, of truthful import, of this Deity in all the worlds. Those<br>names are founded upon his supremacy, his omnipotence, and his acts. In<br>the Vedas the excellent hymn called Sata Rudriya, hath been sung in<br>honour of that great God called the infinite Rudra. That God is the lord<br>of all wishes that are human and heavenly. He is omnipotent, and he is<br>the supreme master. Indeed, that God pervadeth the vast universe. The<br>Brahmanas and the Munis describe him as the First-born of all creatures.<br>He is the First of all the gods; from his mouth was born Vayu (the wind).<br>And since he always protecteth the creatures (of the universe) and<br>sporteth with them, and since also he is the lord of all creatures,<br>therefore is he called Pasupati. And since his Phallic emblem is always<br>supposed to be in the observance of the vow of Brahmacharya, and since he<br>always gladden the world, therefore he is called Maheswara. The Rishis,<br>the gods, the Gandharvas, and Apsaras, always worship his Phallic emblem<br>which is supposed to stand upright. That worship maketh Maheswara glad.<br>Indeed, Sankara (at such worship) becomes happy, pleased, and highly<br>glad. And since with respect to the past, the future, and the present,<br>that God has many forms, he is, on that account, called Vahurupa<br>(many-formed). Possessed of one eye he blazeth forth in effulgence, or he<br>may be regarded to have many eyes on every side of his body. And since,<br>he possesseth the worlds, he is for that reason called Sarva. And since<br>his form is like that of smoke, he is for that reason called Dhurjjati.<br>And since those deities, viz., the Viswedevas are in him, he is for that<br>reason called Viswarupa. And since three goddesses adore and have<br>recourse to that Lord of the universe, viz., Firmament, Water and Earth,<br>he is for that reason called Tryamvaka. And since he always increaseth<br>all kinds of wealth and wisheth the good of mankind in all their acts, he<br>is for that reason called Siva. He possesseth a thousand eyes, or ten<br>thousand eyes, and hath them on all sides. And since he protecteth this<br>vast universe, he is for that reason called Mahadeva. And since he is<br>great and ancient and is the source of life and of its continuance, and<br>since his Phallic emblem is everlasting, he is for that reason called<br>Sthanu. And since the solar and the lunar rays of light that appear in<br>the world are spoken of as the hair on the Three-eyed one, he is for that<br>reason called Vyomakesa. And since, afflicting Brahma and Indra and<br>Varuna and Yama and Kuvera, he destroyeth them ultimately, he is for that<br>reason called Hara. And since, he is the Past, the Future, and the<br>Present, and, in fact, everything in the universe, and since he is the<br>origin of the past, the future, and the present, he is for that reason<br>called Bhava. The word Kapi is said to mean supreme, and Vrisha is said<br>to mean righteousness. The illustrious God of gods, therefore, is called<br>Vrishakapi. And since Maheswara by means of his two eyes closed (in<br>meditation), created through sheer force of will a third eye on his<br>forehead, he is for that reason called the Three-eyed. Whatever of<br>unsoundness there is in the bodies of living creatures, and whatever of<br>soundness there is in them, represent that God. He is the wind, the vital<br>airs called Prana, Apana (and the others) in the bodies of all creatures,<br>including even those that are diseased. He who adoreth any image of the<br>Phallic emblem of that high-souled God, always obtaineth great prosperity<br>by that act. Downwards fiery, and half the body, that is auspiciousness<br>is the moon. His auspiciousness is the moon. So also half his soul is<br>fire and half the moon. His auspicious from, full of energy, is more<br>blazing than the forms of the gods. Among men, his blazing and terrible<br>form is called fire. With that auspicious form he practiseth<br>Brahmacharya. With that other terrible form he as supreme Lord devoureth<br>everything. And since he burneth, since he is fierce, since he is endued<br>with great prowess, and since he devoureth flesh and blood and marrow, he<br>is for this called Rudra. Even such is the deity called Mahadeva, armed<br>with Pinaka, who, O Partha, was seen by thee engaged in slaying thy foes<br>in advance of thy car. After thou hadst vowed to slay the ruler of the<br>Sindhus, O sinless one, Krishna showed thee this God, in thy dream,<br>sitting on the top of that foremost of mountains. This illustrious God<br>proceedeth in advance of thee in battle. It is he who gave thee those<br>weapons with which thou didst slay the Danavas. The hymn approved of the<br>Vedas, and called Sata-Rudriya, in honour of that God of gods, that<br>excellent, famous, life-enhancing, and sacred hymn, has now, O Partha,<br>been explained to thee. This hymn of four divisions, capable of<br>accomplishing every object, is sacred, destructive of all sins, and<br>competent to drive away all stains and to kill all sorrows and all fears.<br>The men that always listen to this succeeds in vanquishing all his foes<br>and is highly respected in the region of Rudra. The person who always<br>attentively reads or listens to the recitation of this excellent and<br>auspicious account, appertaining to battle, of the illustrious Deity, and<br>he worships with devotion that illustrious Lord of the universe,<br>obtaineth all the objects of desire, in consequence of the three-eyed God<br>being gratified with him. Go and fight, O son of Kunti, defeat is not for<br>thee, that hast Janardana. on thy side for thy adviser and protector.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Having addressed Arjuna in these words, the son of<br>Parasara, O chief of the Bharatas, went away to the place he had come<br>from, O chastiser of foes.'
