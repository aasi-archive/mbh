                            "Sanjaya said, 'O monarch! I beholding Vasudeva and Dhananjaya penetrate<br>into their host, having already pierced through many divisions, the kings<br>of the army, fled away in fear. A little while after, however, those<br>high-souled ones, filled with rage and shame, and urged on by their<br>might, became cool and collected, and proceeded towards Dhananjaya. But<br>those, O king, who filled with rage and vindictiveness, proceeded against<br>the son of Pandu in battle, returned not, like rivers never returning<br>from the ocean. Seeing this, many ignoble Kshatriyas incurred sin and<br>hell by flying away from battle, like atheists turning away from the<br>Vedas.[144] Transgressing that throng of cars those two bulls among men,<br>at last, issued out of it, and looked like the sun and the moon freed<br>from the jaws of Rahu. Indeed, the two Krishnas, their fatigue dispelled,<br>having pierced through that vast host, looked like two fishes that had<br>passed through a strong net. Having forced through that impenetrable<br>division of Drona, the way through which was obstructed by dense showers<br>of weapons, those two high-souled heroes looked like Yuga-suns risen (on<br>the welkin). Piercing through those dense showers of weapons and freed<br>from that imminent danger, those high-souled heroes, themselves<br>obstructing the welkin with thick clouds of weapons, seemed like persons<br>escaped from a raging conflagration, or like two fishes from the jaws of<br>a makara. And they agitated the (Kuru) host like a couple of makaras<br>agitating the ocean. Thy warriors and thy sons, while Partha and Krishna<br>were in the midst of Drona's division, had thought that those two would<br>never be able to issue out of it. Beholding, however, those two heroes of<br>great splendour issue out of Drona's division, they no longer, O monarch,<br>hoped for Jayadratha's life. Hitherto they had strong hopes of<br>Jayadratha's life, for they had thought, O king, that the two Krishnas<br>would never be able to escape from Drona and Hridika's son. Frustrating<br>that hope, those two scorchers of foes had, O monarch, crossed the<br>division of Drona, as also the almost uncrossable division of the Bhojas.<br>Beholding them, therefore, ford through those divisions and look like two<br>blazing fires, thy men became possessed with despair and no longer hoped<br>for Jayadratha's life. Then those two fearless heroes, viz., Krishna and<br>Dhananjaya, those enhancers of the fears of foes, began to converse<br>between themselves about the slaughter of Jayadratha. And Arjuna said,<br>'This Jayadratha hath been placed in their midst by six of the foremost<br>car-warriors among the Dhartarashtras. The ruler of the Sindhus, however,<br>shall not escape me if once he is seen by me. If Sakra himself, with all<br>the celestials, become his protector in battle, yet shall we slay him.<br>Thus did the two Krishnas talk. Even so, O mighty-armed one, did they<br>converse amongst themselves, while looking after the ruler of the<br>Sindhus. (Having heard what they said), thy sons set up a loud wail.<br>Those two chastisers of foes then looked like a couple of thirsty<br>elephants of great quickness of motion, refreshed by drinking water,<br>after having passed through a desert. Beyond death and above decrepitude,<br>they then looked like two merchants that have passed over a mountainous<br>country abounding with tigers and lions and elephants. Indeed, beholding<br>them freed (from Drona and Kritavarman), thy warriors regarded the colour<br>of Partha's and Krishna's face to be dreadful; and thy men then, from all<br>sides, set up a loud wail. Freed from Drona who resembled a snake of<br>virulent poison or a blazing fire, as also from the other lords of the<br>earth, Partha and Krishna looked like two blazing suns. Indeed, those two<br>chastisers of foes, freed from Drona's division, which resembled the very<br>ocean, seemed to be filled with joy like persons that have safely crossed<br>the vasty deep. Freed from those dense showers of weapons, from those<br>divisions protected by Drona and Hridika's son, Kesava and Arjuna looked<br>like Indra and Agni, or blazing effulgence. The two Krishnas, pierced<br>with sharp shafts of Bharadwaja's son, and with bodies dripping with<br>bloods, looked resplendent like two mountains decked with flowering<br>Karnikaras. Having forded that wide lake, of which Drona constituted the<br>alligator, darts formed the fierce snakes, shafts, the Makaras, and<br>Kshatriyas, the deep waters, and having issued out of that cloud,<br>constituted by Drona's weapons, whose thunders were the twang of bows and<br>the sound of palms, and whose lightning flashes were constituted by maces<br>and swords, Partha and Krishna looked like the sun and moon freed from<br>darkness. Having crossed the region obstructed by the weapons of Drona,<br>all creatures regarded those mighty and famous bowmen viz., the two<br>Krishnas, as persons who had forded, with the aid of their arms, the five<br>rivers, (viz., the Satadru, the Vipasa, the Ravi, the Chandrabhaga, and<br>the Vitasta) having the ocean for their sixth, when full of water during<br>the season of rains, and abounding with alligators. Casting their eyes,<br>from desire of slaughter, on Jayadratha who was not far off from them,<br>the two heroes looked like two tigers waiting from desire of falling upon<br>a Ruru deer. Such was then the colour of their faces, that thy warriors,<br>O monarch, regarded Jayadratha as one already slain. Possessed of red<br>eyes, O mighty-armed one, and staying together, Krishna and the son of<br>Pandu, at the sight of Jayadratha were filled with joy and roared<br>repeatedly. Indeed, O monarch, the splendour then of Sauri, standing with<br>reins in hand, and of Partha armed with bow, was like that of the sun or<br>fire. Freed from the division of Drona, their joy, at sight of the ruler<br>of the Sindhus, was like that of a couple of hawks at the sight of a<br>piece of flesh. Beholding the ruler of the Sindhus not far off, they<br>rushed in wrath towards him like a couple of hawks swooping down towards<br>a piece of meat. Seeing Hrishikesa and Dhananjaya transgress (the<br>divisions of Drona), thy valiant son, king Duryodhana, whose armour had<br>been bound on his person by Drona, and who was well-versed in grooming<br>and guiding horses, rushed, on a single car, O lord, for the protection<br>of the Sindhus. Leaving those mighty bowmen, viz., Krishna and Partha,<br>behind, thy son, O king, turned back, facing Kesava of lotus-like eyes.<br>When thy son thus outran Dhananjaya, diverse musical instruments were<br>joyfully blown and beat among all thy troops. And leonine roars were<br>uttered mingled with the blare of conchs, beholding Duryodhana staying in<br>the face of the two Krishnas. They also, O king, resembling blazing<br>fires, that stood as the protectors of Jayadratha, were filled with joy<br>upon beholding thy son in battle. Seeing Duryodhana transgress them with<br>his followers, Krishna, O monarch, said unto Arjuna these words suited to<br>the occasion.'"
