                            "Sanjaya said, 'Having fled away from Bhima, Alamvusha, in another part<br>of the field, careered fearlessly in battle. And while he was thus<br>fearlessly careering in battle, the son of Hidimva rushed impetuously at<br>him and pierced him with keen shafts. The battle between those two lions<br>among Rakshasas became terrible. Both of them invoked into existence<br>illusions like Sakra and Samvara (in days of old). Alamvusha, excited<br>with rage, attacked Ghatotkacha. Indeed, that encounter between those two<br>foremost of Rakshasas resembled that of old between Rama and Ravana, O<br>lord! Then Ghatotkacha having pierced Alamvusha, in the centre of the<br>chest with twenty long shafts, repeatedly roared like a lion. Smilingly,<br>O king, Alamvusha also, repeatedly piercing the invincible son of<br>Hidimva, uttered loud roars in joy, filling the entire welkin. Then,<br>those two foremost of Rakshasas, endued with great might, became filled<br>with rage. They fought with each other, displaying their powers of<br>illusion, but without any of them getting any advantage over the other.<br>Each, creating a hundred illusions, stupefied the other. Both<br>accomplished in producing' illusions, O king, that Ghatotkacha displayed<br>in battle, were all destroyed, O monarch, by Alamvusha, producing similar<br>illusions of his own. Beholding that prince of Rakshasas, viz.,<br>Alamvusha, who was accomplished in producing illusions, fight in that<br>manner, the Pandavas became filled with anxiety, they then caused him to<br>be surrounded by many foremost of car-warriors. Bhimasena and others, O<br>monarch, all rushed in rage against him. Hemming him, O sire, on all<br>sides by means of numberless cars, they shrouded him from every side with<br>shafts, like men in a forest encompassing an elephant with blazing<br>brands. Baffling that shower of weapons by means of the illusion of his<br>own weapons, freed himself from that press of cars like an elephant from<br>a forest conflagration. Then drawing his terrible bow whose twang<br>resembled the thunder of Indra, he pierced the son of the Wind-god with<br>five and twenty shafts, and Bhimasena's son with five, and Yudhishthira<br>with three, and Sahadeva with seven, and Nakula with three and seventy,<br>and each of the five sons of Draupadi with five shafts, and uttered a<br>loud roar. Then Bhimasena pierced him in return with nine shafts, and<br>Sahadeva with five. And Yudhishthira pierced the Rakshasa with a hundred<br>shafts. And Nakula pierced him with three shafts. The son of Hidimva<br>having pierced him with five hundred shafts, Alamvusha once more pierced<br>him with seventy, and that mighty warrior uttered a loud roar. With that<br>loud roar of Ghatotkacha the earth shook, O king, with her mountains and<br>forests and with her trees and waters. Deeply pierced on all sides by<br>those great bowmen and mighty car-warriors, Alamvusha pierced each of<br>them in return with five arrows. Then that Rakshasa, O chief of the<br>Bharatas, viz., the son of Hidimva, filled with rage, pierced that other<br>angry Rakshasa in battle with many shafts. Then that mighty prince of<br>Rakshasas, viz., Alamvusha, deeply pierced, quickly shot countless shafts<br>equipped with wings of gold and whetted on stone. Those shafts, perfectly<br>straight, all entered the body of Ghatotkacha, like angry snakes of great<br>strength entering a mountain summit. Then the Pandavas, O king, filled<br>with anxiety, and Hidimva's son Ghatotkacha, also sped at their foe from<br>every side clouds of keen shafts. Thus struck in battle by the Pandavas,<br>desirous of victory, Alamvusha mortal as he was, did not know what to do.<br>Then that delighter in battle, viz., the mighty son of Bhimasena,<br>beholding that state of Alamvusha, set his heart upon his destruction. He<br>rushed with great impetuosity towards the car of the prince of Rakshasas,<br>that car which resembled a burnt mountain summit or a broken heap of<br>antimony. The son of Hidimva, inflamed with wrath, flew from his own car<br>to that of Alamvusha, and seized the latter. He then took him up from the<br>car, like Garuda taking up a snake. Thus dragging him up with his arms,<br>he began to whirl him repeatedly, and then crushed him into pieces,<br>hurling him down on the earth, like a man crushing an earthen pot into<br>fragments by hurling it against a rock. Endued with strength and<br>activity, possessed of great prowess, the son of Bhimasena, inflamed with<br>wrath in battle, inspired all the troops with fear. All the limbs broken<br>and bones reduced to fragments, the frightful Rakshasa Alamvusha, thus<br>slain by the heroic Ghatotkacha, resembled a tall Sala uprooted and<br>broken by the wind. Upon the slaughter of that wanderer of the night, the<br>Parthas became very cheerful. And they uttered leonine roars and waved<br>their garments. Thy brave warriors, however, beholding that mighty prince<br>or Rakshasas, viz., Alamvusha, slain and lying like a crushed mountain,<br>uttered cries, O monarch, of Oh and Alas. And people, possessed with<br>curiosity, went to view that Rakshasa lying helplessly on the earth like<br>a piece of charcoal (no longer capable of burning). The Rakshasa<br>Ghatotkacha, then, that foremost of mighty beings, having thus slain his<br>foe, uttered a loud shout, like Vasava after slaying (the Asura) Vala.<br>Having achieved that exceedingly difficult feat, Ghatotkacha, was much<br>applauded by his sires as also by his relatives. Indeed, having felled<br>Alamvusha, like an Alamvusha fruit, he rejoiced exceedingly with his<br>friends. There arose then a loud uproar (in the Pandava army) of conchs<br>and of diverse kinds of arrows. Hearing that noise the Kauravas uttered<br>loud shouts in reply, filling the whole earth with its echoes.'"
