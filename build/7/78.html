                            "Sanjaya said, 'Hearing these words of the high-souled Kesava, Subhadra,<br>afflicted with grief on account of the death of her son, began to indulge<br>in these piteous lamentations: 'Oh, son of my wretched self, O thou that<br>wast in prowess equal to thy father, O child, how couldst thou perish,<br>going to battle! Alas, how doth that face of thine which resembleth the<br>blue lotus and is graced with beautiful teeth and excellent eyes, now<br>seem, now that, O child, it is covered with battle's dust! Without doubt,<br>thee so brave and unreturning, thee fallen on the field, with beautiful<br>head and neck and arms, with broad chest, low belly, thy limbs decked<br>with ornaments, thee that art endued with beautiful eyes, thee that art<br>mangled with weapon wounds, thee all creatures are, without doubt,<br>beholding as the rising moon! Alas, thou whose bed used to be overlaid<br>with the whitest and costliest sheets, alas, deserving as thou art of<br>every luxury, how dost thou sleep today on the bare earth, thy body<br>pierced with arrows? That hero of mighty arms who used of old to be<br>waited upon by the foremost of beautiful women, alas, how can he, fallen<br>on the field of battle, pass his time now in the company of jackals! He<br>who of old was praised with hymns by singers and bards and panegyrists,<br>alas, he is today greeted by fierce and yelling cannibals and beasts of<br>prey. By whom, alas, hast thou been helplessly slain when thou hadst the<br>Pandavas, O lord, and all the Panchalas, for thy protectors? Oh son, O<br>sinless one, I am not yet gratified with looking at thee. Wretched as I<br>am, it is evident that I shall have to go to Yama's abode. When again<br>shall I cast my eyes on that face of thine, adorned, with large eyes and<br>beautiful locks that smooth face without pimples, from which sweet words<br>and exquisite fragrance constantly issued? Fie on the strength of<br>Bhimasena, on the bowmanship of Partha, on the prowess of the Vrishni<br>heroes, and the might of the Panchalas! Fie on the Kaikeyas, the Chedis,<br>the Matsyas, and the Srinjayas, they that could not protect thee, O hero,<br>while engaged in battle! I behold the earth today to be vacant and<br>cheerless. Without seeing my Abhimanyu, my eyes are troubled with<br>affliction. Thou wast the sister's son of Vasudeva, the son of the<br>wielder of Gandiva, and thyself, a hero and an Atiratha. Alas, how shall<br>I behold the slain! Alas, O hero, thou hast been to me like a treasure in<br>a dream that is seen and lost. Oh, every thing human is as transitory as<br>a bubble of water. This thy young wife is overwhelmed with grief on<br>account of the evil that hath befallen thee. Alas, how shall I comfort<br>her who is even like a cow without her calf! Alas, O son, thou hast<br>prematurely fled from me at a time when thou wast about to bear fruit of<br>greatness, although I am longing for a sight of thee. Without, doubt, the<br>conduct of the Destroyer cannot be understood even by the wise, since<br>although thou hast Kesava for thy protector, thou wast yet slain, as if<br>thou wast perfectly helpless. O son, let that end be thine which is<br>theirs that perform sacrifices and theirs that are Brahmanas of purified<br>soul, and theirs that have practised Brahmacharya, and theirs that have<br>bathed in sacred waters, and theirs that are grateful and charitable and<br>devoted to the service of their preceptors, and theirs that have made<br>sacrificial presents in profusion. That end which is theirs that are<br>brave and unretreating while engaged in battle, or theirs that have<br>fallen in battle, having slain their foes, let that end be thine. That<br>auspicious end which is theirs that have given away a thousand kine, or<br>theirs that have given away in sacrifices, or theirs that give away<br>houses and mansions agreeable to the recipients, that end which is theirs<br>that give away gems and jewels to deserving Brahmanas, or theirs that are<br>punishers of crime, O, let that end be thine. That end which is attained<br>by Munis of rigid vows by Brahmacharya, or that which is attained by<br>those women that adhere to but one husband, O son, let that end be thine.<br>That eternal end which is attained by kings by means of good behaviour,<br>or by those persons that have cleansed themselves by leading, one after<br>another, all the four modes of life, and through due observance of their<br>duties, that end which is theirs that are compassionate to the poor and<br>the distressed, or theirs that equitably divide sweets amongst themselves<br>and their dependants, or theirs that are never addicted to deceit and<br>wickedness, O son, let that end be thine! That end which is theirs that<br>are observant of vows, or theirs that are virtuous, or theirs that are<br>devoted to the service of preceptors, or theirs that have never sent away<br>a guest unentertained, O son, let that end be thine. That end which is<br>theirs that succeed in distress and the most difficult straits in<br>preserving the equanimity of their souls, however much scorched they<br>might be by the fire of grief, O son, let that end be thine. O son, let<br>that end be thine which is theirs that are always devoted to the service<br>of their fathers and mothers, or theirs that are devoted to their own<br>wives only. O son, let that end be thine which is attained by those wise<br>men who, restraining themselves from the wives of others, seek the<br>companionship of only their own wives in season. O son, let that end be<br>thine which is theirs that look upon all creatures with an eye of peace,<br>or theirs that never give pain to others, or theirs that always forgive.<br>O son, let that end be thine which is theirs that abstain from honey,<br>meat, wine, pride and untruth, or theirs that have refrained from giving<br>pain to others. Let that goal be thine which they attain that are modest,<br>acquainted with all the scriptures, content with knowledge, and have<br>their passions under control.'<br><br>"And while cheerless Subhadra, afflicted with grief, was indulging in<br>such lamentations, the princess of Panchala (Draupadi), accompanied by<br>Virata's daughter (Uttara), came to her. All of them, in great grief,<br>wept copiously and indulged in heart-rending lamentations. And like<br>persons reft of reason by sorrow, they fainted away and fell down on the<br>earth. Then Krishna, who stood, ready with water, deeply afflicted,<br>sprinkled it over his weeping, unconscious and trembling sister, pierced<br>in her very heart, and comforting her, said what should be said on such<br>an occasion. And the lotus-eyed one said, 'Grieve not, O Subhadra! O<br>Panchali, console Uttara! Abhimanyu, that bull among Kshatriyas, hath<br>obtained the most laudable goal. O thou of beautiful face, let all the<br>other men yet alive in our race obtain that goal which Abhimanyu of great<br>fame hath obtained. Ourselves with all our friends, wish to achieve, in<br>this battle, that feat, the like of which, O lady, thy son, that mighty<br>car-warrior, hath achieved without any assistance.' Having consoled his<br>sister and Draupadi and Uttara thus, that chastiser of foes, viz., the<br>mighty-armed (Krishna), returned to Partha's side. Then Krishna, saluting<br>the kings, friends and Arjuna, entered the inner apartments of the<br>(latter's) tent while those kings also repaired to respective abodes.'"
