                            "Sanjaya said, 'Thus addressed by Duryodhana, Drona's son, that warrior<br>difficult of defeat in battle, set his heart upon destroying the foe,<br>like Indra bent upon destroying the Daityas. The mighty-armed Aswatthaman<br>answered thy son, saying, 'It is even so as thou sayest, O descendant of<br>Kuru! The Pandavas are always dear to both myself and my father. So also,<br>are we both dear unto them. Not so, however, in battle. We will,<br>according to the measure of our might, fearlessly contend in battle,<br>reckless of our lives. Myself, Karna, Salya, Kripa, and Hridika's son,<br>could, O best of kings, destroy the Pandava host within the twinkling of<br>an eye. The Pandavas also, O best of the Kurus, could within the<br>twinkling of an eye, destroy the Kaurava host, if, O mighty-armed one, we<br>were not present in battle. We are fighting with the Pandavas to the best<br>of our might, and they also are fighting with us to the best of their<br>might. Energy, encountering energy, is being neutralised, O Bharata! The<br>Pandava army is incapable of being vanquished as long as the sons of<br>Pandu are alive. This that I tell thee is true. The sons of Pandu are<br>endued with great might. They are, again, fighting for their own sake.<br>Why should not they, O Bharata, be able to slay thy troops. Thou,<br>however, O king, art exceedingly covetous. Thou, O Kaurava, art<br>deceitful. Thou art vainglorious and suspicious of everything. For this,<br>thou suspectest even us. I think, O king, thou art wicked, of sinful<br>soul, and an embodiment of sin. Mean and of sinful thoughts, thou<br>doubtest us and others. As regards myself, fighting with resolution for<br>thy sake, I am prepared to lay down my life. I will presently go to<br>battle for thy sake, O chief of the Kurus. I will fight with the foe and<br>slay a large number of the enemy. I will fight with the Panchalas, the<br>Somakas, the Kaikeyas, and the Pandayas also, in battle, for doing what<br>is agreeable to thee, O chastiser of foes. Scorched with my arrows today,<br>the Chedis, the Panchalas, and the Somakas, will fly away on all sides<br>like a herd of kine afflicted by a lion. Today, the royal son of Dharma<br>with all the Somakas, beholding my prowess, will regard the whole world<br>to be filled with Aswatthamans. Dharma's son, Yudhishthira, will become<br>exceedingly cheerless, beholding the Panchalas and Somakas slain (by me)<br>in battle. I will, O Bharata, slay all those that will approach me in<br>battle. Afflicted with the might of my arms, none of them, O hero, will<br>escape me today with life.' Having said so unto thy son, Duryodhana, the<br>mighty-armed (Aswatthaman) proceeded to battle, and afflicted all bowmen.<br>That foremost of all living beings thus sought to achieve what was<br>agreeable to thy sons. The son of Gotama's daughter, then addressing the<br>Panchalas and the Kaikeyas, said unto them, 'Ye mighty car-warriors,<br>strike ye all at my body. Displaying your lightness in the use of arms,<br>fight ye with me coolly.' Thus addressed by him, all those combatants, O<br>king, poured showers of weapons upon Drona's son like clouds pouring<br>torrents of rain. Baffling that shower, Drona's son in that battle, slew<br>ten brave warriors amongst them, in the very sight, O lord, of<br>Dhrishtadyumna and the sons of Pandu. The Panchalas and the Somakas then,<br>thus worked in battle, abandoned the son of Drona and fled away in all<br>directions. Beholding those brave warriors, viz., the Panchalas and the<br>Somakas, flying away, Dhrishtadyumna, O king, rushed against Drona's son<br>in that battle. Surrounded then by a hundred brave and unreturning<br>car-warriors mounted upon cars, decked with gold, and the rattle of whose<br>wheels resembled the roar or rain-charged clouds, the mighty car-warrior<br>Dhrishtadyumna, the son of the Panchala king, beholding his warriors<br>slain, addressed Drona's son and said these words, 'O foolish son of the<br>preceptor, what is the use of slaying vulgar combatants. If thou art a<br>hero, fight then with me in battle. I will slay thee. Wait for a moment<br>without flying away.' Saying thus, Dhrishtadyumna of great prowess struck<br>the preceptor's son with many keen and terrible arrows capable of<br>piercing the very vitals. Those swiftly-coursing shafts, equipped with<br>golden wings and keen points, and capable of piercing the body of every<br>foe proceeding in a continuous line, penetrated into Aswatthaman's body,<br>like freely-roaming bees in search of honey entering a flowering tree.<br>Deeply pierced and swelling with rage, like a trodden snake, the proud<br>and fearless son of Drona, arrow in hand, addressed his foe, saying, 'O<br>Dhrishtadyumna, wait for moment, without leaving my presence.' Soon shall<br>I despatch thee to Yama's abode with my keen shafts.' Having said these<br>words, that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the son of Drona, displaying<br>great lightness of hands, covered the son of Prishata from every side<br>with clouds of arrows. Thus covered in that encounter (with arrows) by<br>Drona's son, the Panchala prince, difficult to defeat in battle, said<br>'Thou knowest not of my origin, O Brahmana, or of my vow. O thou of<br>wicked understanding, having first slain Drona himself, I will not,<br>therefore, slay thee today when Drona himself is still alive. O thou of<br>wicked understanding, after this night passeth away and bringeth in the<br>fair dawn, I shall first slay thy sire in battle and then despatch thee<br>also to the region of Spirits. Even this is the wish entertained by me.<br>Standing before me, display, therefore, till then, the hatred thou<br>bearest towards the Parthas, and the devotion thou cherishest for the<br>Kurus. Thou shalt not escape from me with life. That, Brahmana who,<br>abandoning the practices of a Brahmana, devoteth himself to the practices<br>of a Kshatriya, becomes slayable by all Kshatriyas even as thou, O lowest<br>of men.' Thus addressed by Prishata's son in language so harsh and<br>insulting that best of Brahmanas Aswatthaman mustered all his rage and<br>answered, saying, 'Wait, Wait!' And he gazed at Prishata's son apparently<br>burning him with his eyes. Sighing (in rage) like a snake, the<br>preceptor's son, then, covered Dhrishtadyumna in that battle (with a<br>shower of arrows). The mighty-armed son of Prishata, however, that best<br>of car-warriors, surrounded by all the Panchala troops, though thus<br>struck with arrows in that encounter by Drona's son, did not tremble,<br>relying as he did on his own energy. In return, he sped many arrows at<br>Aswatthaman. Both engaged in a gambling match in which the stake was life<br>itself, those heroes, unable to brook each other, resisted each other and<br>checked each other's arrowy showers. And those great bowmen shot dense<br>showers of shafts all around. Beholding that fierce battle, inspiring<br>terror, between Drona's and Prishata's son, the Siddhas and Charanas and<br>other sky-ranging beings applauded them highly. Filling the welkin and<br>all the points of the compass with clouds of shafts, and creating a thick<br>gloom therewith, those two warriors continued to fight with each other,<br>unseen (by any of us). As if dancing in that battle, with their bows<br>drawn to circles, resolutely aspiring to slay each other, those<br>mighty-armed warriors, inspiring fear in every heart, fought wonderfully<br>and with remarkable activity and skill. Applauded by thousands of<br>foremost warriors in that battle, and thus resolutely engaged in fight<br>like two wild elephants in the forest, both the armies, beholding them,<br>became filled with delight. And leonine shouts were heard there, and all<br>the combatants blew their conchs. And hundreds and thousands of musical<br>instruments began to be sounded. That fierce fight, enhancing the terror<br>of the timid, seemed only for a short time to be waged equally. Then<br>Drona's son, O king, making a rush, cut off the bow, and standard, and<br>umbrella, and the two Parshni drivers, and the principal driver, and the<br>four steeds, of the high-souled son of Prishata. And that warrior of<br>immeasurable soul then caused the Panchalas in hundreds and thousands, by<br>means of his straight shafts, to fly away. Beholding those feats of<br>Drona's son, resembling those of Vasava himself in battle, the Pandava<br>host, O bull of Bharata race, began to tremble in fear. Slaying a hundred<br>Panchalas with a hundred arrows, and three foremost of men with three<br>keen arrows, in the very sight of Drupada's son and of Phalguna, that<br>mighty car-warrior, viz., the son of Drona, slew a very large number of<br>Panchalas that stayed before him. The Panchalas then, as also the<br>Srinjayas, thus disconcerted in battle, fled away leaving Drona's son,<br>with their banners torn. Then that mighty car-warrior, viz., the son of<br>Drona, having vanquished his foes in battle, uttered a loud roar like<br>that of a mass of clouds at the end of summer. Having slain a large<br>number of foes, Aswatthaman looked resplendent like the blazing fire at<br>the end of the Yuga, after having consumed all creatures. Applauded by<br>all the Kauravas after having defeated thousands of foes in battle, the<br>valiant son of Drona beamed forth in beauty, like the chief of the<br>celestials himself after vanquishing his foes'."
