                            "Sanjaya said, Having the vanquished the Yavanas and the Kamvojas that<br>foremost of car-warriors, viz., Yuyudhana, proceeded towards Arjuna,<br>right through the midst of thy troops. Like a hunter slaying deer, that<br>tiger among men, (Satyaki), endued with beautiful teeth, clad in<br>excellent armour, and owning a beautiful standard, slew the Kaurava<br>troops and inspired them with fear. Proceeding on his car, he shook his<br>bow with great force, that bow, the back of whose staff was decked with<br>gold, whose toughness was great, and which was adorned with many golden<br>moons. His arms decked with golden Angadas, his head-gear adorned with<br>gold; his body clad in golden mail, his standard and bow also was so<br>embellished with gold, that he shone like the summit of Meru. Himself<br>shedding such effulgence, and bearing that circular bow in his hand, he<br>looked like a second sun in autumn, That bull among men, possessing the<br>shoulders and the tread and eyes of a bull, looked in the midst of thy<br>troops, like a bull in a cow-pen. Thy warriors approached him from desire<br>of slaughter like a tiger approaching the leader, with rent temples, of<br>an elephant-herd, standing proudly in the midst of his herd, resembling<br>as he did and possessed as he was of the tread of an infuriated elephant.<br>Indeed, after he had passed through Drona's division, and the unfordable<br>division of the Bhojas, after he had forded through the sea of<br>Jalasandha's troops as also the host of the Kamvojas, after he had<br>escaped the alligator constituted by Hridika's son, after he had<br>traversed those ocean-like host, many car-warriors of thy army, excited<br>with wrath, surrounded Satyaki. And Duryodhana and Chitrasena and<br>Duhsasana and Vivinsati, and Sakuni and Duhsaha, and the youthful<br>Durdharshana, and Kratha, and many other brave warriors well-conversant<br>with weapons and difficult of defeat, wrathfully followed Satyaki from<br>behind as he proceeded onwards. Then, O sire, loud was the uproar that<br>arose among thy troops, resembling that of the ocean itself at full tide<br>when lashed into fury by the tempest. Beholding all those warriors<br>rushing at him, that bull among the Sinis smilingly addressed his<br>charioteer, saying, 'Proceed slowly. The Dhartarashtra force, swelling<br>(with rage and pride), and teeming with elephants and steeds and cars and<br>foot-soldiers, that is rushing with speed towards me, filling the ten<br>points of the compass with deep roar of its cars, O charioteer, and<br>causing the earth, the welkin, and the very seas, to tremble,<br>therewith,&#8212;this sea of troops, O driver, I will resist in great battle,<br>like the continent resisting the ocean swelling to its utmost height at<br>full moon. Behold, O charioteer, my prowess which is equal to that of<br>Indra himself in great battle. I will consume this hostile force by means<br>of my whetted arrows. Behold these foot-soldiers and horsemen and<br>car-warriors, and elephants slain by me in thousands, their bodies<br>pierced with my fiery arrows.' While saying these words (unto his<br>charioteer), those combatants from desire of battle, speedily came before<br>Satyaki of immeasurable prowess. They made a loud noise, saying as they<br>came, 'Slay, Rush, Wait, See, See!' Of those brave warriors that said<br>these words, Satyaki, by means of his sharp arrows, slew three hundred<br>horsemen and four hundred elephants. The passage at arms between those<br>united bowmen (on the one side) and Satyaki (on the other) was<br>exceedingly fierce, resembling that between the gods and the Asuras (in<br>days of old). An awful carnage set in. The grandson of Sini received with<br>his shafts resembling snakes of virulent poison that force, O sire, of<br>thy son which looked like a mass of clouds. Shrouding every side, in that<br>battle with his arrowy downpours, that valiant hero, O monarch,<br>fearlessly slew a large number of thy troops. Exceedingly wonderful, O<br>king, was the sight that I witnessed there, viz., that not an arrow even,<br>O lord, of Satyaki failed in effect. That sea of troops, abounding in<br>cars and elephants and steeds, and full of waves constituted by<br>foot-soldiers, stood still as soon as it came in contact with the Satyaki<br>continent. That host consisting of panic-stricken combatants and<br>elephants and steeds, slaughtered on all sides by Satyaki with his shafts<br>repeatedly turned round, and wandered hither and thither as if afflicted<br>with the chilling blasts of winter. We saw not foot-soldiers or<br>car-warriors or elephants or horsemen or steeds that were not struck with<br>Yuyudhana's arrows. Not even Phalguna, O king, had caused such a carnage<br>there as Satyaki, O monarch, then caused among those troops. That bull<br>among men, viz., the dauntless grandson of Sini, endued with great<br>lightness of hand and displaying the utmost skill, fighteth, surpassing<br>Arjuna himself. Then king Duryodhana pierced the charioteer of Satwata<br>with three keen shafts and his four steeds with four shafts. And he<br>pierced Satyaki himself with three arrows and once again with eight. And<br>Duhsasana pierced that bull among the Sinis with sixteen arrows. And<br>Sakuni pierced him with five and twenty arrows and Chitrasena with five.<br>And Duhsasana pierced Satyaki in the chest with five and ten arrows. That<br>tiger amongst the Vrishnis then, thus struck with their arrows, proudly<br>pierced every one of them, O monarch, with three arrows. Deeply piercing<br>all his foes with shafts endued with great energy, the grandson of Sini,<br>possessed of great activity and prowess, careered on the field with the<br>celerity of a hawk. Cutting off the bow of Suvala's son and the leathern<br>fence that cased his hand. Yuyudhana pierced Duryodhana in the centre of<br>the chest with three shafts. And he pierced Chitrasena with a hundred<br>arrows, and Duhsaha with ten. And that bull of Sini's race then pierced<br>Duhsasana with twenty arrows. Thy brother-in-law (Sakuni) then, O king,<br>taking up another bow, pierced Satyaki with eight arrows and once more<br>with five. And Duhsasana pierced him with three. And Durmukha, O king,<br>pierced Satyaki with a dozen shafts. And Duryodhana, having pierced<br>Madhava with three and seventy arrows, then pierced his charioteer with<br>three keen shafts. Then Satyaki pierced each of those brave and mighty<br>car-warriors vigorously contending in battle together with five shafts in<br>return. Then the foremost of car-warriors, (viz., Yuyudhana) speedily<br>struck thy son's charioteer with a broad-headed shaft; whereupon, the<br>latter deprived of life, fell down on the earth. Upon the fall of the<br>charioteer, O lord, thy son's car was taken away from the battle by the<br>steeds yoked thereto, with the speed of the wind. Then thy sons, O king,<br>and the other warriors, O monarch, setting their eyes, on the king's car<br>fled away in hundreds. Beholding that host fly away, O Bharata, Satyaki<br>covered it with showers of keen shafts whetted on stone and equipped with<br>wings of gold. Routing all thy combatants counting by thousands, Satyaki,<br>O king, proceeded towards the car of Arjuna. Indeed, thy troops<br>worshipped Yuyudhana, beholding him shooting arrows and protecting his<br>charioteer and himself as he fought in battle.'"
