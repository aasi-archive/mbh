                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then the intelligent Abhimanyu, with limbs mangled with<br>arrows, smilingly addressed his foe, Duhsasana, stationed before him<br>saying, 'By good luck it is that I behold in battle that vain hero<br>arrived before me, who is cruel, who hath cast away all righteousness,<br>and who brawleth out lustily his own praises. In the assembly (for the<br>Kurus) and in the hearing of king Dhritarashtra, thou hadst, with thy<br>harsh speeches, angered king Yudhishthira. Relying on the deception of<br>the dice and the skill (therein) of Suvala's son, thou hadst also<br>maddened by success, addressed many delirious speech to Bhima![67] In<br>consequence of the anger of those illustrious persons, thou art, at last,<br>about to obtain the fruit of that conduct of thine![68]. O thou of wicked<br>understanding, obtain thou without delay the fruit[69] of the robbery of<br>other people's possessions, wrathfulness, of thy hatred of peace, of<br>avarice, of ignorance, of hostilities (with kinsmen), of injustice and<br>persecution, of depriving my sires&#8212;those fierce bowmen&#8212;of their<br>kingdom, and of thy own fierce temper. I shall today chastise thee with<br>my arrows in the sight of the whole army. Today, I shall in battle<br>disburden myself of that wrath which I cherish against thee. I shall<br>today free myself of the debt I owe to angry Krishna and to my sire who<br>always craveth for an opportunity to chastise thee. O Kaurava, today I<br>shall free myself of the debt I owe to Bhima. With life thou shalt not<br>escape me, if indeed, thou dost not abandon the battle.' Having said<br>these words, that mighty-armed warrior, that slayer of hostile heroes,<br>aimed a shaft endued with the splendour of Yama or of Agni or of the<br>Wind-god, capable of despatching Duhsasana to the other world. Quickly<br>approaching Duhsasana's bosom, that shaft fell upon his shoulder-joint<br>and penetrated into his body up to the very wings, like a snake into an<br>ant-hill. And soon Abhimanyu once more struck him with five and twenty<br>arrows whose touch resembled that of fire, and which were sped from his<br>bow drawn to its fullest stretch, Deeply pierced and greatly pained,<br>Duhsasana, sat down on the terrace of his car and was, O king, overtaken<br>by a swoon. Afflicted thus by the arrows of Subhadra's son and deprived<br>of his senses, Duhsasana. was speedily borne away from the midst of the<br>fight by his charioteer. Beholding this, the Pandavas, the five sons of<br>Draupadi, Virata, the Panchalas, and the Kekayas, uttered leonine shouts.<br>And the troops of the Pandavas, filled with joy, caused diverse kinds of<br>musical instruments to be beat and blown. Beholding that feat of<br>Subhadra's son they laughed with joy. Seeing that implacable and proud<br>foe of theirs thus vanquished, those mighty car-warriors, viz., the<br>(five) sons of Draupadi, who had on their banners the images of Yama and<br>Maruta and Sakra and the twin Aswins, and Satyaki, and Chekitana, and<br>Dhrishtadyumna, and Sikhandin, and the Kekayas, and Dhrishtaketu, and the<br>Matsyas, Panchalas, and the Srinjayas, and the Pandavas headed by<br>Yudhishthira, were filled with joy. And all of them rushed with speed,<br>desirous of piercing Drona's array. Then a dreadful battle took place<br>between the warriors and those of the foe, All of them were unretreating<br>heroes, and inspired by desire of victory. During the progress of that<br>dreadful encounter, Duryodhana, O monarch, addressing the son of Radha,<br>said, 'Behold, the heroic Duhsasana, who resembleth the scorching sun who<br>was hitherto slaying the foe in battle, hath at last himself succumbed to<br>Abhimanyu. The Pandavas also, filled with rage and looking fierce like<br>mighty lions, are rushing towards us, desirous of rescuing the son of<br>Subhadra.' Thus addressed, Karna with rage and desirous of doing good to<br>thy son, rained showers of sharp arrows on the invincible Abhimanyu. And<br>the heroic Karna, as if in contempt of his antagonist, also pierced the<br>latter's followers on the field of battle, with many excellent shafts of<br>great sharpness. The high-souled Abhimanyu, however, O king, desirous of<br>proceeding against Drona, quickly pierced Radha's son with three and<br>seventy shafts. No car-warrior of thy army succeeded at that time in<br>obstructing the progress towards Drona, of Abhimanyu, who was the son of<br>Indra's son and who was afflicting all the foremost car-warriors of the<br>Kaurava host. Then Karna, the most honoured of all bowmen, desirous of<br>obtaining victory, pierced the son of Subhadra with hundreds of arrows,<br>displacing his best weapons. That foremost of all persons conversant with<br>weapons, that valiant disciple of Rama, by means of his weapons, thus<br>afflicted Abhimanyu who was incapable of being defeated by foes. Though<br>afflicted in battle by Radha's son with showers of weapons, still<br>Subhadra's son who resembled a very celestial (for prowess) felt no pain.<br>With his shafts whetted on stone and furnished with sharp points, the son<br>of Arjuna, cutting off the bows of many heroic warriors, began to afflict<br>Karna in return. With shafts resembling snakes of virulent poison and<br>shot from his bow drawn to a circle, Abhimanyu quickly cut off the<br>umbrella, standard, the charioteer, and the steeds of Karna, smiling the<br>while. Karna then shot five straight arrows at Abhimanyu. The son of<br>Phalguna, however, received them fearlessly. Endued with great valour and<br>courage, the latter then, in a moment, with only a single arrow, cut off<br>Karna's bow and standard and caused them to drop down on the ground.<br>Beholding Karna in such distress, his younger brother, drawing the bow<br>with great force, speedily proceeded against the son of Subhadra. The<br>Parthas then, and their followers uttered loud shouts and beat their<br>musical instruments and applauded the son of Subhadra [for his heroism].'"
