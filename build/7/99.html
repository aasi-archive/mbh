                            "Sanjaya said, 'After the high-souled son of Kunti had created that<br>water, after he had commenced to hold in cheek the hostile army, and<br>after he had built also that arrowy hall, Vasudeva of great splendour,<br>alighting from the car, unyoked the steeds pierced and mangled with<br>arrows. Beholding that sight never seen before, loud uproars of applause<br>were heard there, uttered by the Siddhas and the Charanas and by all the<br>warriors. Mighty car-warriors (assembled together) were unable to resist<br>the son of Kunti, even when he fought on foot. All this seemed highly<br>wonderful. Although throngs upon throngs of cars, and myriads of<br>elephants and steeds, rushed towards him, yet Partha felt no fear but<br>fought on, prevailing upon all his foes. And the (hostile) kings shot<br>showers of shafts at the son of Pandu. That slayer of hostile heroes,<br>however, viz., the son of Vasava, of virtuous soul, felt no anxiety<br>whatever. Indeed, the valiant Partha received hundreds of arrowy showers<br>and maces and lances coming towards him as the ocean receives hundreds<br>upon hundreds of rivers flowing towards it. With the impetuous might of<br>his own weapons and strength of his arms, Partha received the foremost of<br>shafts shot at him by those foremost of kings. Although staying on the<br>ground, and alone, he succeeded yet in baffling all those kings on their<br>cars, like that one fault, avarice, destroying a host of accomplishments.<br>The Kauravas, O king, applauded the highly wonderful prowess of Partha as<br>also of Vasudeva, saying, 'What more wonderful incident hath ever taken<br>place in this world, or will ever take place than this, viz., that Partha<br>and Govinda, in course of battle, have unyoked their steeds? Displaying<br>fierce energy on the field of battle and the greatest assurance, those<br>best of men have inspired us with great thoughts.' Then Hrishikesa, of<br>eyes like lotus-petals, smiling with the coolest assurance, as if, O<br>Bharata, he was in the midst of an assembly of women (and not armed<br>foes), after Arjuna had created in the field of battle that hall, made of<br>arrows, led the steeds into it, in the very sight. O monarch, of all thy<br>troops. And Krishna, who was well-skilled in grooming horses, then<br>removed their fatigue, pain, froth, trembling and wounds.[142] Then<br>plucking out their arrows and rubbing those steeds with his own hands,<br>and making them trot duly, he caused them to drink. Having caused them to<br>drink, and removed their fatigue and pain, he once more carefully yoked<br>them to that foremost of cars. Then, that foremost one among all wielders<br>of weapons, viz., Sauri, of great energy, mounting on that car with<br>Arjuna, proceeded with great speed. Beholding the car of that foremost of<br>car-warriors once more equipped with these steeds, whose thirst had been<br>slaked, the foremost ones among the Kuru army once more became cheerless.<br>They began to sigh, O king, like snakes whose fangs had been pulled out.<br>And they said, 'Oh, fie, fie on us! Both Partha and Krishna have gone, in<br>the very sight of all the Kshatriyas, riding on the same car, and clad in<br>mail, and slaughtering our troops with as much ease as boys sporting with<br>a toy. Indeed, those scorchers of foes have gone away in the very sight<br>of all the kings displaying the prowess and unimpeded by our shouting and<br>struggling combatants.' Seeing them gone away, other warriors said, 'Ye<br>Kauravas, speed ye for the slaughter of Krishna and the diadem-decked<br>(Arjuna). Yoking his steeds unto his car in the very sight of all (our)<br>bowmen, he of Dasarha's race is proceeding towards Jayadratha,<br>slaughtering us in battle.' And some lords of earth there, O king,<br>amongst themselves, having seen that highly wonderful incident in battle<br>never seen before said, 'Alas, through Duryodhana's fault, these warriors<br>of king Dhritarashtra, the Kshatriyas, and the whole earth, fallen into<br>great distress, are being destroyed. King Duryodhana understands it not.'<br>Thus spoke many Kshatriyas. Others, O Bharata, said, 'The ruler of the<br>Sindhus hath already been despatched to Yama's abode. Of narrow sight and<br>unacquainted with means, let Duryodhana now do what should be done for<br>that king.[143] Meanwhile, the son of Pandu, seeing the sun coursing<br>towards the Western hills, proceeded with greater speed towards the ruler<br>of the Sindhus, on his steeds, whose thirst had been slaked. The (Kuru)<br>warriors were unable to resist that mighty-armed hero, that foremost of<br>all wielders of weapons, as he proceeded like the Destroyer himself in<br>wrath. That scorcher of foes, viz., the son of Pandu, routing the<br>warriors (before him), agitated that army, like a lion agitating a herd<br>of deer, as he proceeded for getting at Jayadratha. Penetrating into the<br>hostile army, he, of Dasarha's race, urged the steeds with great speeds,<br>and blew his conch, Panchajanya, which was of the hue of the clouds. The<br>shafts shot before by the son of Kunti began to fall behind him, so<br>swiftly did those steeds, endued with the speed of the wind, drew that<br>car. Then many kings, filled with rage, and many other Kshatriyas<br>surrounded Dhananjaya who was desirous of slaying Jayadratha. When the<br>(Kuru) warriors thus proceeded towards that bull, among men (viz.,<br>Arjuna) who had stopped for a moment, Duryodhana, proceeding quickly,<br>followed Partha in that great battle. Many warriors, beholding the car<br>whose rattle resembled the roar of clouds, and which was equipped with<br>that terrible standard bearing the ape and whose banner floated upon the<br>wind, became exceedingly cheerless. Then when the sun was almost<br>completely shrouded by the dust (raised by the combatants), the (Kuru)<br>warriors, afflicted with shafts, became incapable of even gazing, in that<br>battle, at the two Krishnas.'"
