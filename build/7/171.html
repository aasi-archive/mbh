                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then all those kings of thy army, incapable of being<br>easily defeated in battle, angrily proceeded against Yuyudhana's car,<br>unable to brook (his feats). Mounting on their well-equipped cars, O<br>king, that were decked with gold and jewels, and accompanied also by<br>cavalry and elephants, they encompassed the Satwata hero. Hemming him on<br>all sides those mighty car-warriors, challenging that hero, uttered loud<br>leonine roars. Those great heroes, desirous of slaying him of Madhu's<br>race, poured their keen arrows on Satyaki of invincible prowess.<br>Beholding them thus advancing with speed towards him, that slayer of<br>hostile hosts, viz., the mighty-armed grandson of Sini, took up and shot<br>many shafts. The heroic and great bowman Satyaki, invincible in battle,<br>cut off many heads with his fierce and straight arrows. And he of Madhu's<br>race also cut off the trunks of many elephants, the necks of many seeds,<br>and arms decked with Angadas of many warriors, by means of razor-faced<br>arrows. With the fallen yak-tails and white umbrellas, O Bharata, the<br>field of battle became almost full, and resembled the firmament, O lord,<br>with stars. The wails of the host thus slaughtered in battle, O Bharata,<br>by Yuyudhana, became as loud as those of shrieking ghosts (in hell). With<br>that loud uproar the earth became filled, and the night became fiercer<br>and more terrible. Beholding his host, afflicted with Yuyudhana's arrows<br>breaking, and hearing that tremendous uproar at dead of night making the<br>hair stand on end, thy son, that mighty car-warrior, addressing his<br>driver, repeatedly said, 'Urge the steeds to that spot whence this uproar<br>cometh.' Then king Duryodhana, that firm bowman, above all modes of<br>warfare, rushed against Yuyudhana. Madhava pierced Duryodhana with a<br>dozen blood-drinking shafts, sped from his bow drawn to its fullest<br>stretch. Thus afflicted with arrows by Yuyudhana first, Duryodhana,<br>excited with rage, pierced the grandson of Sini in return with ten<br>arrows. Meanwhile, the battle that raged between the Panchalas and all<br>thy troops presented an exceedingly wonderful sight. Then the grandson of<br>Sini, excited with rage in that battle, pierced thy son, that mighty<br>car-warrior, with eighty shafts, in the chest. He then, with other<br>shafts, despatched Duryodhana's steeds to Yama's abode. And that slayer<br>of foes then quickly felled his antagonist's driver from the car. Thy<br>son, O monarch, staying on that steedless car, shot many keen arrows<br>towards Satyaki's car. The grandson of Sini, however, displaying great<br>lightness of hand, O king, cut off those fifty shafts sped in that battle<br>by thy son. Then Madhava, with a broad-headed shafts suddenly cut off in<br>that encounter the formidable bow of thy son in the handle, Deprived of<br>both his car and bow, that puissant ruler of men then mounted quickly<br>upon the bright car of Kritavarman. Upon Duryodhana's retreat, the<br>grandson of Sini, O monarch, afflicted and routed thy army at dead of<br>night.<br><br>"Sakuni, meanwhile, O king, encompassing Arjuna on all sides with many<br>thousands of cars and several thousands of elephants, and many thousands<br>of steeds, began to fight desperately. Many of them hurled towards Arjuna<br>celestial weapons of great power. Indeed, those Kshatriyas fought with<br>Arjuna, incurring the certitude of death. Arjuna, however, excited with<br>rage, checked those thousands of cars and elephants and steeds, and<br>ultimately caused those foes to turn back. Then Suvala's son, with eyes<br>red as copper with rage, deeply pierced Arjuna, that slayer of foes, with<br>twenty shafts. And once more shooting a hundred shafts, he checked the<br>progress of Partha's great car. Then Arjuna, O Bharata, pierced Sakuni<br>with twenty arrows in that battle. And he pierced each of the great<br>bowmen with three arrows. Checking all of them with his arrows, O king,<br>Dhananjaya slew those warriors of thy army with excellent shafts, endued<br>with the force of thunder.[227] Strewn with lopped off arrows, O monarch,<br>and (dead) bodies by thousands, the earth looked as if covered with<br>flowers. Indeed, strewn with the heads of Kshatriyas, heads that were<br>decked with diadems and handsome noses and beautiful ear-rings and<br>(nether) lips bit in rage and wide open eyes,&#8212;heads that were graced<br>with collars and crowned also with gems, and which, while life was in<br>them, spoke sweet words,&#8212;the earth looked resplendent as if strewn with<br>hillocks overspread with Champaka flowers. Having achieved that fierce<br>feat, and pierced Sakuni once more, struck Uluka with an arrow in that<br>battle. Piercing Uluka thus in the sight of his sire, viz., Suvala's son,<br>Arjuna uttered a loud roar, filling the earth therewith. Then the son of<br>Indra cut off Sakuni's bow. And then he despatched his four steeds to<br>Yama's abode. Then Suvala's son, O bull of Bharata's race, jumping down<br>from his car, quickly ascended the car of Uluka. Then those two mighty<br>car-warriors, viz., sire and son, both riding on the same car, showered<br>their arrows on Partha like two risen clouds pouring torrents of rain on<br>a mountain. The son of Pandu then piercing both those warriors with keen<br>shafts, afflicted and caused thy troops to fly away in hundreds and<br>thousands. Like a mighty mass of clouds dispersed on all sides by the<br>wind, that army of thine, O monarch, was dispersed on all sides. Indeed,<br>that host, O chief of the Bharatas, thus slaughtered on the night, fled<br>away in all directions, afflicted with fear and in the very sight (of<br>their leaders). Many abandoning the animals they rode, other urging their<br>animals to their greatest speed, turned back from the battle, inspired<br>with fear, during that fierce hour of darkness. Having vanquished thy<br>warriors thus, O bull of Bharata's race, Vasudeva and Dhananjaya<br>cheerfully blew their conchs.<br><br>"Dhrishtadyumna, O monarch, piercing Drona with three arrows, quickly cut<br>off the latter's bowstring with a sharp arrow. Throwing down that bow on<br>the earth, heroic Drona, that grinder of Kshatriyas, took up another that<br>was exceedingly tough and strong. Piercing Dhrishtadyumna then with five<br>arrows, Drona pierced his driver also, O bull of Bharata's race, with<br>five arrows. Checking Drona with his arrows, the mighty car-warrior<br>Dhrishtadyumna began to destroy the Kaurava host, like Maghavat<br>destroying the Asura army. During the slaughter of thy son's army, O<br>sire, a terrible river, having blood for its current, began to flow. And<br>it ran between the two hosts, bearing away men and steeds and elephants<br>along its current. And it resembled, O king, the Vaitarani that flows, O<br>lord, towards the domains of Yama. Agitating and routing thy army, the<br>valiant Dhrishtadyumna, endued with great energy, blazed forth like Sakra<br>in the midst of the celestials. Then Dhrishtadyumna and Sikhandin blew<br>their large conchs, as also the twins (Nakula and Sahadeva), and<br>Vrikodara, the son of Pandu. Thus those fierce warriors, vanquished<br>thousands of kings; on thy side that were endued with great energy, at<br>the sight of thy Son and of Karna and the heroic Drona and Drona's son, O<br>monarch!'"
