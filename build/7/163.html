                            "Sanjaya said, 'When the field of battle which had before been enveloped<br>in darkness and dust had thus become illuminated, heroic warriors<br>encountered one another, desirous of taking one another's life.[218]<br>Encountering one another in battle, O king, those combatants, armed with<br>lances and swords and other weapons, gazed at one another under the<br>influence of rage. With thousands of lamps blazing all around and with<br>the more blazing lamps of the gods and the Gandharvas, set upon golden<br>stands decked with jewels, and fed with fragrant oil, the field of<br>battle, O Bharata, looked resplendent like the firmament bespangled with<br>stars. With hundreds upon hundreds of blazing brands, the earth looked<br>exceedingly beautiful. Indeed, the earth seemed to be in a conflagration,<br>like what happens at the universal destruction.[219] All the points of<br>the compass blazed up with those lamps all around and looked like trees<br>covered by fire-flies at an evening in the season of rains. Heroic<br>combatants, then, O king, engaged in battle with heroic rivals. Elephants<br>engaged with elephants, and horsemen with horsemen, and car-warriors with<br>car-warriors, filled with joy, on that fierce night at the command of thy<br>son. The clash of the two armies both consisting of four kinds of forces,<br>became terrible. Then Arjuna, O monarch, began, with great speed, to<br>destroy the Kaurava ranks, weakening all the kings.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'When the invincible Arjuna, excited with wrath and<br>unable to brook (the feats of the Kurus), penetrated into the army of my<br>son, what became the state of your minds? Indeed, when that scorcher of<br>foes entered into their midst, what did the soldiers think? What steps<br>also did Duryodhana think fit to be adopted then? Who were those<br>chastisers of foes that proceeded in that battle against that hero?<br>Indeed, when Arjuna, of white steeds, entered (our army), who were they<br>that protected Drona? Who guarded the right wheel and who the left wheel<br>of Drona's car? Who were those heroes that protected the rear of that<br>battling hero? Indeed, when Bharadwaja's son proceeded, slaying the foe<br>(along his route), who were they that proceeded in his van? That mighty<br>and invincible bowman who penetrated into the midst of the Panchalas,<br>that tiger among men endued with great valour, who proceeded, as if<br>dancing, along the track of his car, and consumed large throngs of<br>Panchala cars by means of his shafts like a raging conflagration; alas,<br>how did that Drona meet with his death? Thou always speakest of my foes<br>as cool and unvanquished and cheerful and swelling with might in battle.<br>Thou dost not, however, speak of mine in such words. On the other hand,<br>thou describest them to be slain, pale, and routed, and thou speakest of<br>my car-warriors, as always deprived of their cars in all the battles they<br>fight!'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Understanding the wishes of Drona who was bent on<br>battle, Duryodhana, on that night, O king, addressing his obedient<br>brothers, viz., Vikarna and Chitrasena and Suparsva and Durdharsha and<br>Dirghavahu, and all those that followed them, said those words, 'Ye<br>heroes of great valour, struggling with resolution, all of you protect<br>Drona from the rear. The son of Hridika will protect his right and Sala<br>his left.' Saying this, thy son then urged forward placing them at the<br>van, the remnant of the brave and mighty Trigarta car-warriors, saying,<br>'The preceptor is merciful. The Pandavas are fighting with great<br>resolution.. While engaged in slaughtering the foe in battle, protect him<br>well, uniting together. Drona is mighty in battle; is endued with great<br>lightness of hand and great valour. He can vanquish the very gods in<br>battle,&#8212;what need then be said of the Pandavas and the Somakas? All of<br>you, however, united together and struggling with great resolution in<br>this terrible battle, protect the invincible Drona from that mighty<br>car-warrior, viz., Dhrishtadyumna. Except Dhrishtadyumna, I do not see<br>the man amongst all the warriors of the Pandavas that can vanquish Drona<br>in battle. I, therefore, think that we should, with our whole soul,<br>protect the son of Bharadwaja. Protected (by us), he is sure to slay the<br>Somakas and the Srinjayas, one after another. Upon the slaughter of all<br>the Srinjayas at the head of the (Pandava) army, Drona's son without<br>doubt, will slay Dhrishtadyumna in battle. Similarly, the mighty<br>car-warrior Karna will vanquish Arjuna in battle. As regards Bhimasena<br>and others clad in mail, I will subjugate them all in fight. The rest of<br>the Pandavas deprived of energy, will be easily defeated by the warriors.<br>It is evident, my success then will last for ever. For these reasons,<br>protect the mighty car-warrior Drona in battle.' Having said these words,<br>O chief of the Bharatas, thy son Duryodhana, urged his troops on that<br>night of terrible darkness. Then commenced a battle, O chief of the<br>Bharatas, between the two hosts. O Monarch, both actuated by the desire<br>of victory. Arjuna began to afflict the Kauravas, and the Kauravas began<br>to afflict Arjuna, with diverse kinds of weapons. Drona's son covered<br>the, ruler of the Panchalas, and Drona himself covered the Srinjaya, with<br>showers of straight shafts in that battle. And as the Pandava and the<br>Panchala troops (on the one side) and the Kaurava troops (on the other),<br>O Bharata, were engaged in slaughtering each other, there arose a furious<br>uproar on the field. The battle that took place on that night was so<br>terrible and fierce that its like had never been previously witnessed by<br>ourselves or those gone before us.'"
