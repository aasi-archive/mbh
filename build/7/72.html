                            "Sanjaya said, 'When that terrible day, so fraught with the slaughter of<br>creatures, departed, and when the sun set, the beautiful twilight of the<br>evening spread itself. The troops, O bull of Bharata's race, of both<br>parties, had retired to their tents. Then the ape-bannered Jishnu, having<br>slain a large number of Samsaptakas by means of his celestial weapons,<br>proceeded towards his tent, mounted on that victorious car of his. And as<br>he was proceeding, he asked Govinda, with voice choked with tears, 'Why<br>is my heart afraid, O Kesava, and why both my speech falter? Evil omens<br>encounter me, and my limbs are weak. Thoughts of disaster possess my mind<br>without living it. On earth, on all sides, various omens strike me with<br>fear. Of many kinds are those omens and indications, and seen everywhere,<br>foreboding dire calamity. Is it all right with my venerable superior,<br>viz., the king with all his friends?'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'It is evident that everything is right with thy brother<br>and his friends. Do not grieve, some trifling evil in another direction<br>will happen.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Then those two heroes (viz., Krishna and Arjuna),<br>having adored the Twilight,[125] mounted on their car and proceeded,<br>talking of the day's battle so destructive of heroes. Having achieved<br>feats exceedingly difficult of accomplishment, Vasudeva and Arjuna, at<br>last, reached the (Pandava) encampment. Then that slayer of hostile<br>heroes, viz., Vibhatsu, beholding the camp joyless and melancholy and<br>everything to be in confusion, addressed Krishna with an agonised heart,<br>and said, 'O Janardana, no auspicious trumpet blows today, its blasts<br>mingled with the beat of drums and the loud blare of conchs. The sweet<br>Vina also is nowhere played upon in accompaniment with slapping of<br>palms.[126] Auspicious and delightful songs fraught with praise are<br>nowhere recited or sung by our bards amongst the troops. The warriors<br>also, all recede hanging down their heads. They do not tell me beholding<br>me, as before, of the feats achieved by them. O Madhava, is it all right<br>with my brothers today? Beholding our own men plunged in grief, I know no<br>peace. Is it all right, O giver of honours, with the ruler of the<br>Panchalas, or Virata, or all our warriors, O thou of unfading glory?<br>Alas, Subhadra's son, ever cheerful, doth not today, with his brothers,<br>come out with smiles to receive me returning from battle.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Thus conversing, those two, (viz., Krishna and Arjuna),<br>entered their own camp. And they saw that the Pandavas, all cheerless,<br>were sitting, plunged in great grief. Beholding his brothers and sons,<br>the ape-bannered Arjuna became very cheerless. Not seeing the son of<br>Subhadra there, Arjuna said, 'Pale is the colour I behold of the faces of<br>you all. I do not, again, see Abhimanyu. Nor doth he come to congratulate<br>me. I heard that Drona had today formed the circular array. None amongst<br>you, save the boy Abhimanyu, could break that array. I, however, did not<br>teach him how to come out of that array, after having pierced it. Did you<br>cause the boy to enter that array? Hath that slayer of heroes, viz., the<br>son of Subhadra, that mighty bowman, having pierced that array, through<br>numberless warriors of the enemy in battle, fallen, at last in the fight?<br>Oh, tell me, how that hero of mighty arms and red eyes, born (in our<br>line) like a lion on the mountain breast, and equal unto the younger<br>brother of Indra himself, hath fallen on the field of battle? What<br>warrior, deprived on his senses by Death ventured to slay that dear son<br>of Subhadra, that favourite of Draupadi and Kesava, that child ever loved<br>by Kunti? Equal unto the high-souled Vrishni hero, Kesava, himself in<br>prowess and learning and dignity, how hath he been slain on the field of<br>battle? The favourite son of that daughter of the Vrishni race, always<br>cherished by me, alas, if I do not see him I will repair to the abode of<br>Yama. With locks ending in soft curls, of tender years, with eyes like<br>those of a young gazelle, with tread like that of an infuriated elephant,<br>tall like a Sala offshoot, of sweet speech accompanied with smiles,<br>quiet, ever obedient to the behest of his superiors, acting like one of<br>mature years though tender in age, of agreeable speech, reft of vanity,<br>of great courage and great energy, of large eyes resembling lotus-petals,<br>kind to those devoted to him, self-restrained, following nothing mean,<br>grateful, possessed of knowledge, accomplished in weapons, unretreating<br>from battle, always delighting in fight, and enhancing the fears of foes,<br>engaged in the welfare of kinsmen, desirous of victory into sires, never<br>striking first, perfectly fearless in battle, alas, if I do not behold<br>that son, I will repair to the abode of Yama. In the counting of<br>car-warriors always reckoned as a Maharatha, superior to me one and a<br>half times, of tender years, of mighty arms, even dear to Pradyumna and<br>Kesava and myself, alas, if I do not behold that son I will repair to the<br>abode of Yama. Of beautiful nose, of beautiful forehead, of fair eyes and<br>eyebrows and lips, if I do not behold that face, what peace can my heart<br>have? Melodious as the voice of the male Kokila, delightful, and sweet as<br>the warblings of the Vina, without listening to his voice, what peace can<br>my heart have? His beauty was unrivalled, rare even among the celestials.<br>Without casting my eyes on that form, what peace can my heart have?<br>Accomplished in saluting (his superiors) with reverence, and always<br>obedient to the behests of his sires, alas, if I do not behold him, what<br>peace can my heart have? Brave in battle, accustomed to every luxury,<br>deserving of the softest bed, alas, he sleepeth today on the bare earth,<br>as if there is none to take care of him, although he is foremost of those<br>that have protectors to look after them. He on whom, while on his bed,<br>the foremost of beautiful women used to attend, alas, he mangled with<br>shafts, will have inauspicious jackals, prowling over the field, to<br>attend upon him today. He who was formerly roused from his slumbers by<br>singers and bards and panegyrists, alas, he will today be surely awakened<br>by discordant beasts of prey. That beautiful face of his eminently<br>deserved to be shaded by the umbrella, alas, the dust of battle-field<br>will surely befoul today. O child, unfortunate that I am, death forcibly<br>takes thee away from me, who was never satiated with looking at thee.<br>Without doubt, that abode of Yama, which is always the goal of persons of<br>righteous deeds, that delightful mansion, illuminated today by thy own<br>splendours, is rendered exceedingly beautiful by thee. Without doubt,<br>Yama and Varuna and Satakratu and Kuvera, obtaining thee as a favourite<br>guest, are making much of thy heroic self. Thus indulging in diverse<br>lamentations, like a merchant whose vessel has been sunken. Arjuna,<br>afflicted with great grief, asked Yudhishthira, saying, 'O, thou of<br>Kuru's race, hath he ascended to heaven, having caused a great slaughter<br>among the enemy and contended with the foremost warriors in the face of<br>battle? Without doubt, while contending single-handed with foremost of<br>warriors, countless in number, and fighting with vigour and resolution,<br>his heart turned towards me from a desire of help. While afflicted by<br>Karna and Drona and Kripa and others with sharp shafts of diverse kinds<br>and bright points, my sons of little strength, must have repeatedly<br>thought, 'My father will in this press be my rescuer.' I think, while<br>indulging in such lamentations, he was felled on the ground by cruel<br>warriors. Or, perhaps, when he was begotten by me, when he was the nephew<br>of Madhva, when he was born in Subhadra he could not have uttered such<br>lamentations. Without doubt, my heart, hard as it is, is made of the<br>essence of the thunder, since it breaketh not, even though I do not<br>behold that mighty-armed hero of red eyes. How could those mighty bowmen<br>of cruel hearts shoot their deep-piercing shafts upon that child of<br>tender years, who, again, Was my son and the nephew of Vasudeva? That<br>noble-hearted youth who, coming forward every day, used to congratulate<br>me, alas, why doth he not present himself today to me when I come back<br>having slain the foe? Without doubt, overthrown, he lieth today on the<br>bare earth bathed in blood. Beautifying the earth by his body, he lieth<br>like the sun fallen (from the firmament). I grieve for Subhadra, who,<br>hearing of the death in battle of her unretreating son, will, afflicted<br>with sorrow, cast away her life. What will Subhadra missing Abhimanyu,<br>say unto me? What also will Draupadi say unto me? Afflicted with grief as<br>they are, what also shall I say unto them? Without doubt, my heart is<br>made of the essence of the thunder, since it breaketh not in a thousand<br>fragments at the sight of my weeping daughter-in-law, pierced with grief.<br>The leonine shouts of the Dhritarashtras swelling with pride did, indeed,<br>enter my ears. Krishna also heard Yuyutsu, censuring the heroes (of the<br>Dhritarashtra army in these words): 'Ye mighty car-warriors, having been<br>unable to vanquish Vibhatsu, and having slain only a child, why do ye<br>rejoice? Why, having done what is disagreeable to those two, viz., Kesava<br>and Arjuna, in battle, why do you in joy roar like lions, when truly the<br>hour for sorrow is come? The fruits of this sinful deed of Yours will<br>soon overtake you. Heinous is the crime perpetrated by you. How long will<br>it not bear its fruits?' Rebuking them in these words, the high-souled<br>son of Dhritarashtra by his Vaisya wife, went away, casting off his<br>weapons afflicted with rage and grief. O Krishna, why did you not tell me<br>all this during the battle? I would then have consumed all those<br>car-warriors of cruel hearts.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Then Vasudeva, consoling Partha who was afflicted<br>with grief on account of his son, who was exceedingly anxious, whose eyes<br>were bathed in tears, and who was, in fact, overwhelmed with this sorrow<br>caused by the slaughter of his child, said unto him, 'Do not yield so to<br>grief. This is the way of all brave, unretreating heroes, especially of<br>Kshatriyas, whose profession is battle. O foremost of intelligent men,<br>even this is the goal ordained by the authors of our scriptures for<br>unretreating heroes engaged in battle. Death is certain for heroes that<br>do not retreat. There is no doubt that Abhimanyu hath ascended to those<br>regions that are reserved for persons of righteous acts. O bull of<br>Bharata's race, even this is coveted by all that are brave, viz., that<br>they may die in battle, facing their foes. As regards Abhimanyu, he<br>having slain in battle many heroic and mighty princes, hath met with that<br>death in the face of battle which is coveted by heroes. Do not grieve, O<br>tiger among men I The legislators of old have declared this to be the<br>eternal merit of the Kshatriyas, viz., their death in battle. O best of<br>the Bharatas, these brothers of thine are all exceedingly cheerless, as<br>also the king, and these thy friends, seeing thee plunged in grief. O<br>giver of honours, comfort them in consoling words. That which should be<br>is known to thee. It behoveth thee not to grieve.' Thus comforted by<br>Krishna of wonderful deeds, Partha then said these words unto all his<br>brothers, with voice choked with sorrow: 'O lord of the earth, I desire<br>to hear how the mighty-armed Abhimanyu, how that hero of large eyes,<br>resembling lotus-petals, fought. Ye will see that I will exterminate the<br>foe with his elephants and cars and steeds, I will exterminate in battle<br>those slayers of my son with all their followers and kinsmen. Ye all are<br>accomplished in arms. Ye all were armed with weapons, how then could<br>Subhadra's son be slain, even if it were the wielder of the thunder-bolt<br>himself with whom he fought? Alas, if I had known that Pandavas and the<br>Panchalas would be able to protect my son in battle, I myself would have<br>then protected him. Ye were then on your cars, ye were shooting your<br>shafts. Alas, how then could Abhimanyu be slain by the foe, causing a<br>great carnage in your ranks? Alas, ye have no manliness, nor have ye any<br>prowess, since in the very sight of you all was Abhimanyu slain. Or, I<br>should chide my own self, since knowing that ye all are weak, cowardly,<br>and irresolute, I went away! Alas, are your coats of mail and weapons of<br>all kinds only ornaments for decking your persons, and were words given<br>to you only for speaking in assemblies, that ye failed to protect my son<br>(even though ye were clad in mail, armed from head to foot, and even<br>though you had assured me in words of your competence)?&#8212;Having said<br>these words, Partha sat down, holding bow and his excellent sword.<br>Indeed, none could, at that time, even look at Vibhatsu who then<br>resembled the Destroyer himself in wrath, repeatedly drawing deep<br>breaths. None of his friends or kinsmen could venture to look at or speak<br>unto Arjuna, as he sat there exceedingly afflicted with grief on account<br>of his son, and with face bathed in tears. None! Indeed could address<br>him, save Vasudeva or Yudhishthira. These two, under all circumstances,<br>were acceptable to Arjuna. And because they were highly reverenced and<br>dearly loved, therefore, could they alone address him at such times. Then<br>king Yudhishthira addressing Partha, of eyes like lotus-petals, who was<br>then filled with rage and exceedingly afflicted with grief on account of<br>the death of his son, said these words.
