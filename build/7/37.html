                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'My heart, O Sanjaya, is agitated with different<br>emotions, viz., shame and gratification, upon hearing that Subhadra's son<br>singly held in cheek the whole army of my son. O son of Gavalgana, ten me<br>everything once more in detail about the encounter of youthful Abhimanyu,<br>which seems to have been pretty like Skanda's encounter with the Asura<br>host.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'I will relate to thee that fearful encounter that fierce<br>battle, as it took place between one and the many. Mounted upon his car,<br>Abhimanyu, with great daring, showered his arrows on the warriors of thy<br>army mounted on their cars, all of whom were chastisers of foes, endued<br>with great courage. Careering with great speed like a circle of fire, he<br>pierced Drona and Karna, and Kripa, and Salya and Drona's son, and<br>Kritavarman of the Bhoja race, and Vrihadvala, and Duryodhana, and<br>Somadatta, and mighty Sakuni, and diverse kings and diverse princes and<br>diverse bodies of troops. While engaged in slaying his foes by means of<br>superior weapons, the valiant son of Subhadra, endued with mighty energy,<br>seemed, O Bharata, to be present everywhere. Beholding that conduct of<br>Subhadra's son of immeasurable energy, thy troops trembled repeatedly.<br>Seeing that warrior of great proficiency in battle, Bharadwaja's son of<br>great wisdom, with eyes expanded in joy, quickly came towards Kripa, and<br>addressing him said, as if crushing (by that speech of his) the very<br>vitals of thy son, O Bharata, the following words, 'Yonder cometh the<br>youthful son of Subhadra at the head of the Parthas, delighting all his<br>friends, and king Yudhishthira, and Nakula, and Sahadeva, and Bhimasena,<br>the son of Pandu, and all his kinsmen, and relatives by marriage, and all<br>who are watching the battle as spectators without taking any part in it.<br>I do not regard any bowman to be his equal in battle. If only he<br>entertains the wish, he can slay this vast host. It seems, that for some<br>reason or other, he doth not entertain that wish.' Hearing these words of<br>Drona, so expressive of the gratification he felt, thy son, enraged with<br>Abhimanyu, looked at Drona, faintly smiling the while. Indeed, Duryodhana<br>said unto Karna and king Valhika and Duhsasana and the ruler of the<br>Madras and the many other mighty car-warriors of his army, these words,<br>'The preceptor of the entire order of the Kshatriyas,&#8212;he that is the<br>foremost of all conversant with Brahma, doth not, from stupefaction, wish<br>to slay this son of Arjuna. None can, in battle, escape the preceptor<br>with life, not even the Destroyer himself, if the latter advanceth<br>against the preceptor as a foe. What, O friend, shall we say then of any<br>mortal? I say this truly. This one is the son of Arjuna, and Arjuna is<br>the preceptor's disciple. It is for this that the preceptor protecteth<br>this youth. Disciples and sons and their sons are always dear to the<br>virtuous people. Protected by Drona, the youthful son of Arjuna regardeth<br>himself valourous. He is only a fool entertaining a high opinion of<br>himself. Crush him, therefore, without delay.' Thus addressed by the Kuru<br>king, those warriors, O monarch, excited with rage and desirous of<br>slaying their foe, rushed, in the very sight of Drona at the son of<br>Subhadra that daughter of the Satwata race. Duhsasana, in particular,<br>that tiger among the Kurus, hearing those words of Duryodhana, answered<br>the latter, saying, 'O monarch, I tell thee that even I will slay this<br>one in the very sight of the Pandavas and before the eyes of the<br>Panchalas. I shall certainly devour the son of Subhadra today, like Rahu<br>swallowing Surya (sun).' And once more addressing the Kuru king loudly,<br>Duhsasana said, 'Hearing that Subhadra's son hath been slain by me, the<br>two Krishnas, who are exceedingly vain, will without doubt, go to the<br>region of the departed spirits, leaving this world of men. Hearing then<br>of the death of the two Krishnas, it is evident that the other sons born<br>of Pandu's wives, with all their friends, will, in course of a single<br>day, cast away their lives from despair. It is evident, therefore, that<br>this one foe of thine being slain, all thy foes will be slain. Wish me<br>well, O king, even I will slay this foe of thine.' Having said these<br>words, O king, thy son Duhsasana, filled with rage and uttering a loud<br>roar, rushed against the son of Subhadra and covered him with showers of<br>arrows. Abhimanyu then, O chastiser of foes, received that son of thine<br>thus advancing upon him wrathfully, with six and twenty arrows of sharp<br>points. Duhsasana, however, filled with rage, and looking like an<br>infuriated elephant, fought desperately with Abhimanyu, the son of<br>Subhadra in that battle. Both of them masters in car-fight, they fought<br>on describing beautiful circles with their cars, one of them to the left<br>and other to the right. The warriors then, with their Panavas and<br>Mridangas and Dundubhis and Krakachas and great Anakas and Bheris and<br>Jharjaras, caused a deafening noise mingled with leonine roars, such as<br>arise from the great receptacle of salt waters!"
