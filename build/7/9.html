                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'How did the Pandavas and the Srinjayas slay Drona<br>in battle,&#8212;Drona. who was so accomplished in weapons amongst all<br>wielders of arms? Did his car break (in course of the fight)? Did his bow<br>break while he was striking (the foe)? Or, was Drona careless at the time<br>when he met with his death-blow? How, indeed, O child, could Prishata's<br>son, (viz., Dhrishtadyumna) the prince of the Panchalas, slay that hero<br>incapable of being humiliated by enemies, who scattered thick showers of<br>shafts furnished with wings of gold, and who was endued with great<br>lightness of hand, that foremost of Brahmanas, who was accomplished in<br>everything, acquainted with all modes of warfare, capable of shooting his<br>shafts to a great distance, and self-restrained, who was possessed of<br>great skill in the use of weapons and armed with celestial weapons, that<br>mighty warrior, of unfading glory, who was always careful, and who<br>achieved the fiercest feats in battle? It is plain, it seems to me, that<br>destiny is superior to exertion, since even brave Drona hath been slain<br>by the high-souled son of Prishata, that hero in whom were the four kinds<br>of weapons, alas, thou sayest that that Drona, that preceptor in<br>bowmanship, is slain. Hearing of the slaughter of that hero who used to<br>ride his bright car covered with tiger skins and adorned with pure gold.<br>I cannot drive away my grief. Without doubt, O Sanjaya, no one dies of<br>grief caused by another's calamity, since, wretch that I am, I am yet<br>alive although I have heard of Drona's death. Destiny I regard to be all<br>powerful, exertion is fruitless. Surely, my heart, hard as it is, is made<br>of adamant, since it breaketh not into a hundred pieces, although I have<br>heard of Drona's death. He who was waited up-on by Brahmanas and princes<br>desirous of instruction in the Vedas and divination and bowmanship, alas,<br>how could he be taken away by Death? I cannot brook the overthrow of<br>Drona which is even like the drying up of the ocean, or the removal of<br>Meru from its site, or the fall of the Run from the firmament. He was a<br>restrainer of the wicked and a protector of the righteous. That scorcher<br>of foes who hath given up his life for the wretched Duryodhana, upon<br>whose prowess rested that hope of victory which my wicked sons<br>entertained, who was equal to Vrihaspati or Usanas himself in<br>intelligence, alas, how was he slain? His large steeds of red hue,<br>covered with net of gold, fleet as the wind and incapable of being struck<br>with any weapon in battle, endued with great strength, neighing<br>cheerfully, well-trained and of the Sindhu breed, yoked unto his car and<br>drawing the vehicle excellently, always preserving in the midst of<br>battle, did they become weak and faint? Coolly bearing in battle the roar<br>of elephants, while those huge creatures trumpeted at the blare of conchs<br>and the beat of drums, unmoved by the twang of bows and showers of arrows<br>and other weapons, foreboding the defeat of foes by their very<br>appearance, never drawing long breaths (in consequence of toil), above<br>all fatigue and pain, how were those fleet steeds that drew the car of<br>Bharadwaja's son soon over-powered? Even such were the steeds yoked unto<br>his golden car. Even such were the steeds yoked thereto by that foremost<br>of human heroes. Mounted on his own excellent car decked with pure gold,<br>why, O son, could he not cross the sea of the Pandava army? What feat<br>were achieved in battle by Bharadwaja's son, that warrior who always drew<br>tears from other heroes, and upon whose knowledge (of weapons) all the<br>bowmen of the world rely? Firmly adhering to truth, and endued with great<br>might, what, indeed, did Drona do in battle? Who were those car-warriors<br>that encountered that achiever of fierce deeds, that foremost of all<br>wielders of the bow, that first of heroes, who resembled Sakra himself in<br>heaven? Did the Pandava fly away beholding him of the golden car and of<br>mighty strength who invoked into existence celestial weapons? Or, did<br>king Yudhishthira the just, with his younger brothers, and having the<br>prince of Panchala (Dhrishtadyumna) for his binding chord,[13] attack<br>Drona, surrounding him with his troops on all sides? Verily, Partha must<br>have, with his straight shafts, checked all the other car-warriors, and<br>then Prishata's son of sinful deeds must have surrounded Drona. I do not<br>see any other warrior, save the fierce Dhrishtadyumna protected by<br>Arjuna, who could have compassed the death of that mighty hero? It seems<br>that when those heroes, viz., the Kekayas, the Chedis, the Karushas, the<br>Matsyas, and the other kings, surrounding the preceptor, pressed him<br>exceedingly like ants pressing upon a snake, while he was engaged in some<br>difficult feat, the wretched Dhrishtadyumna must have slain him then.<br>This is what, I think. He who, having studied the four Vedas with their<br>branches and the histories forming the fifth (Veda), became the refuge of<br>the Brahmanas, as the ocean is of rivers, that scorcher of foes, who<br>lived both as a Brahmana and as a Kshatriya, alas, how could that<br>Brahmana, reverend in years, meet with his end at the edge of a weapon?<br>Of a proud spirit, he was yet often humiliated and had to suffer, pain on<br>my account. However undeserving of it, he yet attained at the hands of<br>Kunti's son, the fruit of his own conduct.[14] He, upon whose feats<br>depend all wielders of bows in the world, alas, how could that hero,<br>firmly adhering to truth and possessed of great skill, be slain by<br>persons desirous of affluence? Foremost in the world like Sakra himself<br>in heaven, of great might and great energy, alas, how could he be slain<br>by the Parthas, like the whale by the smaller fish? He, from whose<br>presence no warrior desirous of victory could ever escape with life, he<br>whom, while alive, these two sounds never left, viz., the sound of the<br>Vedas by those desirous of Vedic lore, and the twang of bows caused by<br>those desirous of skill in bowmanship, he who was never cheerless, alas,<br>that tiger among men, that hero endued with prosperity and never<br>vanquished in battle, that warrior of prowess equal to that of the lion<br>or the elephant, hath been slain. Verily, I cannot bear the idea of his<br>death. How could Prishata's son, in the sight of the foremost of men,<br>slay in battle that invincible warrior whose might was never humiliated<br>and whose fame was never tarnished? Who were they that fought in Drona's<br>van, protecting him, standing by his side? Who proceeded in his rear and<br>obtained that end which is so difficult of attainment? Who were those<br>high-souled warriors that protected the right and the left wheels of<br>Drona? Who were in the van of that hero while he struggled in battle? Who<br>were they that, reckless of their lives on that occasion, met with death<br>which stood face to face with them? Who were those heroes that went in<br>the last journey in Drona's battle? Did any of those Kshatriyas that were<br>assigned for Drona's protection, proving false, abandon that hero in<br>battle? Was he slain by the foe after such desertion and while alone?<br>Drona would never, from fear, show his back in battle, however great the<br>danger. How then was he slain by the foe? Even in great distress, O<br>Sanjaya, an illustrious person should do this, viz., put forth his<br>prowess according to the measure of his might. All this was in Drona; O<br>child, I am losing my senses. Let this discourse be suspended for a<br>while. After regaining my senses I will once more ask thee, O Sanjaya!'"
