                            "Sanjaya said, 'After the divisions of the Kuru army had been (thus)<br>arrayed, and a loud uproar, O sire, had, arisen; after drums and<br>Mridangas began to be beaten and played upon, after the din of the<br>warriors and the noise of musical instruments had become audible; after<br>conch began to be blown, and an awful roar had arisen, making the hair<br>stand on end; after the field of battle had beer slowly covered by the<br>Bharata heroes desirous of fight; and after the hour called Rudra had set<br>in, Savyasachin made his appearance. Many thousands of ravens and crows,<br>O Bharata, proceeded sporting on the front of Arjuna's car. Various<br>animals of terrible cries, and jackals of inauspicious sight, began to<br>yell and howl on our right as we proceeded to battle. Thousands of<br>blazing meteors fell with great noise. The whole earth trembled on that<br>dreadful occasion. Dry winds blew in all directions, accompanied by<br>thunder, and driving bard pebbles and gravel when Kunti's son came at the<br>commencement of battle. Then Nakula's son, Satanika, and Dhrishtadyumna,<br>the son of Pritha, those two warriors possessed of great wisdom, arrayed<br>the several divisions of the Pandavas. Then thy son Durmarshana,<br>accompanied by a thousand cars, a hundred elephants, three thousand<br>heroes, and ten thousand foot-soldiers, and covering a piece of ground<br>that measured the length of fifteen hundred bows, took up his position at<br>the very van of all the troops, and said: 'Like the continent resisting<br>the surging sea, even I will today resist the wielder of Gandiva, that<br>scorcher of foes, that warrior who is irresistible in battle. Let people<br>today behold the wrathful Dhananjaya collide with me, like a mass of<br>stone against another stony mass. Ye car-warriors that are desirous of<br>battle, stay ye (as witness). Alone I will fight with all the Pandavas<br>assembled together, for enhancing my honour and fame. That high-souled<br>and noble son of thine, that great bowman saying this, stood there<br>surrounded by many great bowmen. Then, like the Destroyer himself in<br>wrath, or Vasava himself armed with the thunder, or Death's irresistible<br>self armed with his club and urged on by Time, or Mahadeva armed with the<br>trident and incapable of being ruffled, or Varuna bearing his noise, or<br>the blazing fire at the end of the Yuga risen for consuming the creation,<br>the slayer of the Nivatakavachas inflamed with rage and swelling with<br>might, the ever-victorious Jaya, devoted to truth and desirous of<br>achieving his great vow, clad in mail and armed with sword, decked in<br>golden diadem, adorned with garlands of swords of white flowers and<br>attired in white robes, his arms decked with beautiful Angadas and ears<br>with excellent ear-rings, mounted on his own foremost of cars, (the<br>incarnate) Nara, accompanied by Narayana, shaking his Gandiva in battle,<br>shone brilliantly like the risen sun. And Dhananjaya of great prowess,<br>placing his car, O king, at the very van of his army, where densest<br>showers of arrows would fall, blew his conch. Then Krishna also, O sire,<br>fearlessly blew with great force his foremost of conchs called<br>Panchajanya as Partha blew his. And in consequence of the blare of the<br>conchs, all the warriors in thy army, O monarch, trembled and became lost<br>heart. And their hair stood on end at that sound. As an creatures are<br>oppressed with fright at the sound of the thunder, even so did all thy<br>warriors took fright at the blare of those conchs. And all the animals<br>ejected urine and excreta. Thy whole army with its animals became filled<br>with anxiety, O king, and in consequence of the blare of those (two)<br>conchs, all men, O sire, lost their strength. And some amongst them, O<br>monarch, were inspired with dread, and some lost their senses. And the<br>ape on Arjuna's banner, opening his mouth wide, made an awful noise with<br>the other creatures on it, for terrifying thy troops. Then conchs and<br>horns and cymbals and Anakas were once more blown and beat for cheering<br>thy warriors. And that noise mingled with the noise of diverse (other)<br>musical instruments, with the shouts of warriors and the slaps of their<br>arm-pits, and with their leonine roars uttered by great car-warriors in<br>summoning and challenging (their antagonists). When that tumultuous<br>uproar rose there, an uproar that enhanced the fear of the timid, the son<br>of Pakasana, filled with great delight, addressing him of Dasarha's race,<br>said (these words).'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'Urge the steeds, O Hrishikesa, to where Durmarshana<br>stayeth. Piercing through that elephant division I will penetrate into<br>the hostile army.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed by Savyasachin, the mighty-armed<br>Kesava urged the steeds to where Durmarshana was staying. Fierce and<br>awful was the encounter that commenced there between one and the many, an<br>encounter that proved very destructive of cars and elephants and men.<br>Then Partha, resembling a pouring cloud, covered his foes with showers of<br>shafts, like a mass of clouds pouring rain on the mountain breast.[135]<br>The hostile of car-warriors also, displaying great lightness of hand,<br>quickly covered both Krishna and Dhananjaya with clouds of arrows. The<br>mighty-armed Partha, then, thus opposed in battle by his foes, became<br>filled with wrath, and began to strike off with his arrows the heads of<br>car-warriors from their trunks. And the earth became strewn with<br>beautiful heads decked with ear-rings and turbans, the nether lips bit by<br>the upper ones, and the faces adorned with eyes troubled with wrath.<br>Indeed, the scattered heads of the warriors looked resplendent like an<br>assemblage of plucked off and crushed lotuses lying strewn about the<br>field. Golden coats of mail[136] dyed with gore (lying thick over the<br>field), looked like masses of clouds charged with lightning. The sound, O<br>king, of severed heads dropping on the earth, resembled that of falling<br>palmyra fruits ripened in due time, headless trunks arose, some with bow<br>in hand, and some with naked swords upraised in the act of striking.<br>Those brave warriors incapable of brooking Arjuna's feats and desirous of<br>vanquishing him, had no distinct perception as to when their heads were<br>struck off by Arjuna. The earth became strewn with heads of horses,<br>trunks of elephants, and the arms and legs of heroic warriors. 'This is<br>one Partha', 'Where is Partha? Here is Partha!', 'Even thus, O king, the<br>warriors, of thy army became filled with the idea of Partha only.<br>Deprived of their senses by Time, they regarded the whole world to be<br>full of Partha only, and therefore, many of them perished, striking one<br>another, and some struck even their own selves. Uttering yells of woe,<br>many heroes, covered with blood, deprived of their senses, and in great<br>agony, laid themselves down, calling upon their friends and kinsmen.<br>Arms, bearing short arrows, or lances, or darts, or swords, or<br>battle-axes, or pointed stakes, or scimitars, or bows, or spears, or<br>shafts, or maces, and cased in armour and decked with Angadas and other<br>ornaments, and looking like large snakes, and resembling huge clubs, cut<br>off (from trunks) with mighty weapons, were seen to jump about, jerk<br>about, and move about, with great force, as if in rage. Every one amongst<br>those that wrathfully advanced against Partha in that battle, perished,<br>pierced in his body with some fatal shafts of that hero. While dancing on<br>his car as it moved, and drawing his bow, no one there could detect the<br>minutest opportunity for striking him. The quickness with which he took<br>his shafts, fixed them on the bow, and let them off, filled all his<br>enemies with wonder. Indeed Phalguna, with his shafts, pierced elephants<br>and elephant-riders, horses and horse-riders, car-warriors and drivers of<br>cars. There was none amongst his enemies, whether staying before him or<br>struggling in battle, or wheeling about, whom the son of Pandu did not<br>slay. As the sun rising in the welkin destroyeth the thick gloom, even so<br>did Arjuna destroy that elephant-force by means of his shafts winged with<br>Kanka plumes. The field occupied by thy troops, in consequence of riven<br>elephants fallen upon it, looked like the earth strewn with huge hills at<br>the hour of universal dissolution. As the midday sun is incapable of<br>being looked at by all creatures, even so was Dhananjaya, excited with<br>wrath, incapable of being looked at, in battle, by his enemies. The<br>troops of thy son, O chastiser of foes, afflicted (with the arrows of<br>Dhananjaya), broke and fled in fear. Like a mass of clouds pierced and<br>driven away by a mighty wind, that army was pierced and routed by Partha.<br>None indeed could gaze at the hero while he was slaying the foe. Urging<br>their heroes to great speed by spurs, by the horns of their bows, by deep<br>growls, by encouraging behests, by whips, by cuts on their flanks, and by<br>threatening speeches, thy men, viz., thy cavalry and thy car-warriors, as<br>also thy foot-soldiers, struck by the shafts of Arjuna, fled away from<br>the fields. Others (that rode on elephants), fled away, urging those huge<br>beasts by pressing their flanks with their hooks and many warriors struck<br>by Partha's arrows, in flying, ran against Partha himself. Indeed, thy<br>warriors, then became all cheerless and their understandings were all<br>confused.
