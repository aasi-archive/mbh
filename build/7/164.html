                            "Sanjaya said, 'During the progress of that terrible nocturnal<br>engagement, O king, which was fraught with an indiscriminate carnage,<br>Dharma's son Yudhishthira, addressed the Pandavas, the Panchalas, and the<br>Somakas. Indeed, O king, for the destruction of men, cars, and elephants,<br>king Yudhisthira commanded his own troops, saying, 'Proceed ye against<br>Drona only, for slaying him!'[220] At the command of the king, O monarch,<br>the Panchalas and the Somakas rushed against Drona alone, uttering<br>terrible shouts. Ourselves excited with rage, and loudly roaring in<br>return, rushed against them, to the best of our prowess, courage, and<br>might, in battle. Kritavarman, the son of Hridika, rushed against<br>Yudhishthira, as the latter was advancing against Drona, like an<br>infuriated elephant against an infuriated compeer. Against Sini's<br>grandson who advanced scattering arrowy showers all around, rushed, O<br>king, the Kuru warrior Bhuri, that grinder (of foes) in battle. Karna,<br>the son of Vikartana, O king, resisted that mighty car-warrior, viz.,<br>Pandu's son, Sahadeva, as the letter advanced for getting at Drona. King<br>Duryodhana, in that battle, himself rushed against that foremost of<br>car-warriors, viz., Bhimasena, advancing on his car like the Destroyer.<br>Sakuni, the son of Suvala, O king, proceeding quickly, resisted that<br>foremost of warriors, viz., Nakula, who was conversant with every kind of<br>battle. Kripa, the son of Saradwat, O king, resisted Sikhandin in that<br>battle, that foremost of car-warrior, as the latter advanced on his car.<br>Duhsasana, O king, contending vigorously, resisted Prativindhya as the<br>letter advanced with resolution (on his car), drawn by steeds looking<br>like peacocks. Aswatthaman, O monarch, resisted Bhimasena's son, viz.,<br>Rakshasa (Ghatotkacha) acquainted with a hundred kinds of illusion, as<br>the latter advanced. Vrishasena. in that battle resisted the mighty<br>Drupada with his troops and followers as the latter advanced for getting<br>at Drona. The ruler of the Madras, O king, excited with wrath resisted<br>Virata, O Bharata, as the latter quickly advanced for the slaughter of<br>Drona; Chitrasena, in that battle, resisted, with great force and<br>shooting many shafts, Nakula's son, Satanika, as the latter advanced for<br>slaying Drona. The prince of the Rakshasas, viz., Alambhusha, O king,<br>resisted Arjuna, that foremost of car-warriors, as the latter advanced.<br>Dhrishtadyumna, the prince of the Panchalas, cheerfully resisted the<br>great bowman Drona as the latter was engaged in slaughtering the foe. As<br>regards the mighty car-warriors of the Pandavas, that advanced (against<br>Drona), other car-warriors of thy army, O king, resisted them with great<br>force. Elephant riders speedily encountering elephant riders in that<br>dreadful battle, began to fight, with each other and grind each other by<br>thousands. At dead of night, O monarch, as the steeds rushed against each<br>other with impetuosity, they looked like winged hills. Horsemen, O<br>monarch, encountered horsemen, armed with lances and darts and swords,<br>and uttering loud shouts. Large numbers of men slaughtered one another in<br>heaps, with maces and short clubs and diverse other weapons. Kritavarman,<br>the son of Hridika, excited with wrath, resisted Dharma's son,<br>Yudhishthira, like continents resisting the swelling sea. Yudhishthira,<br>however, piercing Hridika's son with five arrows, once more pierced him<br>with twenty, and addressing him, said, Wait, Wait.' Then Kritavarman, O<br>sire, excited with wrath, cut off with a broad-headed shaft, the bow of<br>king Yudhishthira the just and pierced the latter with seven arrows.<br>Taking up another bow, that mighty car-warrior, viz., Dharma's son,<br>pierced the son of Hridika in the arms and chest with ten arrows. Then<br>that warrior of Madhu's race, thus pierced, O sire, by Dharma's son in<br>that battle, trembled with rage and afflicted Yudhishthira with seven<br>shafts. Then Pritha's son cutting off his enemy's bow as also the<br>leathern fence that cased his hands, sped at him five keen shafts whetted<br>on stone. Those fierce shafts, piercing through the latter's costly<br>armour, decked with gold, entered the earth like snakes into an ant-hill.<br>With the twinkling of an eye, Kritavarman, taking up another bow, pierced<br>the son of Pandu with sixty arrows and once more with ten. Of<br>immeasurable soul, the son of Pandu, then placing his large bow on his<br>car, sped at Kritavarman a dart resembling a snake. That dart decked with<br>gold, shot by the son of Pandu, piercing through Kritavarman's right arm,<br>entered the earth. Meanwhile, Pritha's son, taking up his formidable bow,<br>shrouded the son of Hridika with showers of straight shafts. Then brave<br>Kritavarman, that great car-warrior among the Vrishnis, within less than<br>the twinkling of an eye, made Yudhishthira steedless and driverless and<br>carless. Thereupon, the eldest son of Pandu took up a sword and a shield.<br>Then he, of Madhu's race, cut off both those weapons in that battle.<br>Yudhishthira then, taking up a fierce lance, equipped with a gold-decked<br>staff, quickly sped it, in that battle, at the illustrious son of<br>Hridika. Hridika's son, however, smiling the while, and displaying great<br>lightness of hand, cut off into two fragments that lance hurled from the<br>arms of Yudhishthira, as it coursed impetuously towards him. He then<br>covered the son of Dharma with a hundred arrows in that encounter.<br>Excited with wrath, he then cut off the latter's coat of mail with<br>showers of shafts. Yudhishthira's armour, decked with gold, cut off by<br>Hridika's son with his shafts, dropped down from his body, O king, like a<br>cluster of stars dropping down from the firmament. His armour cut off,<br>himself deprived of car and afflicted with the shafts of Kritavarman,<br>Dharma's son, Yudhishthira, quickly retreated from battle. The mighty<br>car-warrior Kritavarman, then, having vanquished Yudhishthira, the son of<br>Dharma, once more began to protect the wheel of Drona's car.'"
