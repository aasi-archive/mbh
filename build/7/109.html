                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Tell me, O Sanjaya, how Yuyudhana rushed against<br>the son of Bharadwaja in battle. I feel a great curiosity to hear it.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Listen, O thou of great wisdom, to the account of that<br>battle, that makes the hair stand on end, between Drona and the Pandayas<br>headed by Yuyudhana. Beholding the (Kuru) army slaughtered, O sire, by<br>Yuyudhana, Drona himself rushed towards that warrior of unbaffled<br>prowess, called also by the name of Satyaki. Satyaki pierced that mighty<br>car-warrior, viz., the son of Bharadwaja, thus advancing against him,<br>with five and twenty small arrows. Drona also, possessed of great prowess<br>in battle, with deliberate aim, quickly pierced Yuyudhana, with five<br>whetted arrows, equipped with wings of gold. Those arrows, piercing the<br>hard mount of the foe and drinking his life-blood, entered the earth, O<br>king, like hissing snakes. The long-armed Satyaki then, inflamed with<br>rage like an elephant struck with the hook, pierced Drona with fifty long<br>arrows that resembled flames of fire. Then Bharadwaja's son, thus quickly<br>pierced in battle by Yuyudhana, pierced carefully exerting Satyaki in<br>return with many arrows. Then that great bowman, endued with great might,<br>and filled with rage, once more afflicted that hero of the Satwata race<br>with many straight shafts. Thus struck in that battle by the son of<br>Bharadwaja, Satyaki, O monarch, knew not what to do. Then, O king,<br>Yuyudhana's face became cheerless, seeing the son of Bharadwaja shoot<br>countless keen arrows. Beholding Satyaki thus situated, thy sons and<br>troops, O king, becoming exceedingly cheerful, repeatedly uttered leonine<br>roars. Hearing that terrible uproar and beholding that hero of Madhu's<br>race thus afflicted, king Yudhishthira, O monarch, addressing all his<br>soldiers, said, 'That foremost one among the Vrishnis, viz., the brave<br>Satyaki, of prowess incapable of being baffled, is about to be devoured<br>by the heroic Drona, like the sun by Rahu. Go and rush ye to the spot<br>where Satyaki is battling.' The king, addressing Dhrishtadyumna. of the<br>Panchala race, said, Rush thou with speed at Drona. Why dost thou tarry,<br>O son of Prishata! Seest thou not the great danger to ourselves that has<br>already arisen from Drona? Drona is a great bowman. He is sporting with<br>Yuyudhana, in battle, like a boy with a bird bound in a string. Let all<br>of you, headed by Bhimasena, and accompanied by others proceed thither<br>where Satyaki's car is. Behind you I will follow with my troops. Rescue<br>Satyaki today who is already within the jaws of the Destroyer.' Having<br>said these words, O Bharata, king Yudhishthira with all his troops rushed<br>towards Drona for the sake of Yuyudhana. Blessed be thou, great was the<br>uproar made there by the Pandavas and the Srinjayas all fighting with<br>Drona only. Together approaching, O tiger among men, that mighty<br>car-warrior, viz., the son of Bharadwaja, they covered with showers of<br>keen arrows equipped with the feathers of Kankas and peacocks. Drona,<br>however, received all those heroes smilingly, like a householder<br>receiving guests arrived of their own will, with seats and water. With<br>the shafts of Bharadwaja's bow-wielding son, those heroes were<br>well-gratified like guest, O king, with the hospitality they receive in<br>the houses (of good hosts). And none of them, O lord, could even gaze at<br>the son of Bharadwaja who then resembled the thousand-rayed sun at<br>midday. Indeed, Drona, that foremost of all wielders of weapons, scorched<br>all those great bowmen with showers of arrows like the sun scorching<br>(everything below) with his burning rays. Thus struck, O king, by Drona,<br>the Pandavas and the Srinjayas beheld no protector, like elephants sunk<br>in a morass. The mighty arrows of Drona, as they coursed (through the<br>welkin), looked like the rays of the sun blasting everything around. In<br>that encounter, five and twenty warriors among the Panchalas were slain<br>by Drona, who were all regarded as Maharathas and all approved (as such)<br>by Dhrishtadyumna. And amongst all the troops of the Pandavas and the<br>Panchalas, men quietly beheld brave Drona slaying the foremost of<br>warriors in succession. Having slain a hundred warriors amongst the<br>Kekayas and routing them on all sides, Drona stood, O monarch, like the<br>Destroyer himself with wide-open mouth. The mighty-armed Drona vanquished<br>the Panchalas, the Srinjayas, the Matsyas and the Kekayas, O monarch, by<br>hundreds and thousands. Pierced by the arrows of Drona, the clamour made<br>by them resembled that made in the woods by the denizens of the forest<br>when encompassed by a conflagration. The gods, Gandharvas, and the<br>Pitris, said, 'Behold, the Panchalas, and the Pandavas, with all their<br>troops, are flying away.' Indeed, when Drona was thus engaged in<br>slaughtering the Somakas in battle, none ventured to advance against him<br>and none succeeded in piercing him. And while that dreadful encounter, so<br>destructive of great heroes, continued, Pritha's son (Yudhishthira)<br>suddenly heard the blare of Panchajanya. Blown by Vasudeva, that best of<br>conchs gave loud blasts. Indeed, while the heroic protectors of the ruler<br>of the Sindhus were fighting, and while the Dhartarashtras were roaring<br>in front of Arjuna's car, the twang of Gandiva could not be heard. The<br>royal son of Pandu repeatedly swooned, and thought, 'Without doubt, all<br>is not well with Partha, since that prince of conchs (Panchajanya) is<br>yielding such blasts and since the Kauravas also, filled with joy, are<br>incessantly uttering such shouts.' Thinking in this way, with an anxious<br>heart, Ajatasatru, the son of Kunti, said unto him of the Satwata race<br>(viz., Satyaki) these words in a voice choked with tears. Though<br>repeatedly stupefied, king Yudhishthira, however, did not lose sight of<br>what was to be done next. Addressing Sini's grandson, that bull of his<br>clan, (Yudhishthira said), 'O grandson of Sini, the time for that eternal<br>duty which the righteous ones of old have indicated (for friends) towards<br>friends in seasons of distress, hath now come. O bull amongst the Sinis,<br>reflecting within myself, I do not, O Satyaki, see amongst all my<br>warriors one who is a greater well wisher to us than thou art. He who is<br>always well-affected, he who is always obedient, I think, he should be<br>appointed to a grave commission in times of distress. As Kesava is ever<br>the refuge of the Pandavas even, so art thou, O thou of Vrishni's race,<br>who art like Kesava in prowess. I will, therefore, lay a burthen on thee.<br>It behoveth thee not to frustrate my purpose. Arjuna is thy brother,<br>friend, and preceptor, O bull among men, in this battle render him aid in<br>time of distress. Thou art devoted to truth. Thou art a hero. Thou art<br>the dispeller of the fears of friends. Thou art celebrated in the world,<br>in consequence of thy acts, O hero, as one that is truthful in speech.<br>He, O grandson of Sini, who casteth away his body while fighting in<br>battle for friends, is equal to him who giveth away to Brahmanas the<br>whole earth. We have heard of various kings gone to heaven, having given<br>away the whole of this earth unto Brahmanas with due rites. O thou of<br>virtuous soul, I beg of thee, with joined hands, even this viz., that, O<br>lord, attain thou the fruit of giving away (unto Brahmanas) the whole<br>earth, or something higher than that by incurring danger to thy life<br>itself for helping Arjuna. There is one, viz., Krishna, that dispeller of<br>the fears of friends, who is ever willing to cast away his life in battle<br>(for the sake of friends). Thou, O Satyaki, art the second. None but a<br>hero can render aid unto a hero, exerting valorously in battle, from<br>desire of fame. An ordinary person cannot do so. In this matter, here is<br>none else but thee who can protect Arjuna. On one occasion, while<br>applauding thy numerous feats, Arjuna, giving me great pleasure<br>repeatedly recited them. He said of thee that thou art endued with<br>extreme lightness of hand, that thou art conversant with all modes of<br>warfare, that thou art possessed of great activity and great prowess. He<br>said, 'Satyaki is endued with great wisdom, is acquainted with every<br>weapon, is a hero, and is never stupefied in battle. Of broad neck and<br>broad chest, of mighty arms and broad cheeks, or great strength and great<br>prowess, Satyaki is a high-souled Maharatha. He is my disciple and<br>friend; I am dear to him and he is dear to me. Becoming my ally,<br>Yuyudhana will crush the Kauravas. Even if Kesava and Rama, and<br>Aniruddha, and the mighty car-warrior Pradyumna, and Gada, and Sarana,<br>and Samva, with all the Vrishnis, case themselves in mail for assisting<br>us, O king, in the field of battle, I shall yet appoint that tiger among<br>men viz., Satyaki of unbaffled prowess, for our aid, since there is none<br>equal to him.' Even this is what Dhananjaya told me in the Dwaita woods,<br>in thy absence, while truly describing thy merits in an assembly of<br>righteous persons. It behoveth thee not, O thou of the Vrishni race, to<br>falsify that expectation of Dhananjaya, and also of myself and Bhima!<br>When, returning from various tirthas, I proceeded to Dwaraka; there I<br>witnessed thy reverence for Arjuna. While we were at Upaplavya I did not<br>mark anybody else, O grandson of Sini, who showed us such affection as<br>thou didst. Thou art of noble lineage and feelest reverence for us. For<br>showing kindness, therefore, to one who is thy friend and preceptor, it<br>behoveth thee, O thou of mighty arms, to act in a way deserving, O great<br>bowman, of thy friendship and prowess and noble parentage and<br>truthfulness. O thou of Madhu's race! Suyodhana, cased in armour by Drona<br>himself, hath suddenly gone, following Arjuna! The other great<br>car-warriors of Kauravas have, before that followed Arjuna. Loud uproars<br>are being heard against Arjuna's car. O grandson of Sini, it behoveth<br>thee, O giver of honours, to go thither quickly. Bhimasena and ourselves,<br>well-equipped and with all our forces, will resist Drona if he advances<br>against thee. Behold, O Grandson of Sini, the Bharata troops are flying<br>away in battle, and as they are flying away, they are tittering loud<br>wails. Like the very ocean at full tide agitated by a mighty tempest, the<br>Dhartarashtra host, O sire, is agitated by Savyasachin. Behold, in<br>consequence of countless cars and men and steeds moving quickly, the<br>earthly dust raised is gradually spreading (over the field). See, that<br>slayer of hostile hosts, Phalguna, is encompassed by the Sindhu-Sauviras,<br>armed with spikes and lances and adorned with many horses in their ranks.<br>Without vanquishing this force it will not be possible to vanquish<br>Jayadratha. These warriors are prepared to lay down their lives for the<br>sake of the ruler of the Sindhus. Behold the invincible Dhartarashtra<br>force, stationed there, that bristles with arrows and darts and tall<br>standards, and that teems with steeds and elephants. Hear the beat of<br>their drums and the loud blare of their conchs, the tremendous leonine<br>shouts uttered by them, and the rattle of their car-wheels. Hear the<br>grunt of their elephants, the heavy tread of their foot-soldiers, and the<br>stamping of their rushing cavalry which all seem to shake the very earth<br>itself. Before him is the division of Jayadratha, and behind is that of<br>Drona. So great is the number of the foes that he is capable of<br>afflicting the chief of the celestials himself. Sunk in the midst of the<br>fathomless host, Arjuna may lose his life. If he be slain in battle, how<br>can one like me live? Is this calamity to befall me when thou art alive?<br>Dark-blue in colour, young in years, of curled locks and exceedingly<br>handsome is that son of Pandu. Active in the use of weapons, and<br>conversant with every mode of warfare, the mighty-armed Arjuna hath, O<br>sire, penetrated into the Bharata host at sunrise. The day is about to<br>end. O thou of Vrishni's race, I do not know whether he liveth or not.<br>The vast Kuru host is like ocean. O sire, Vibhatsu hath penetrated into<br>it all alone. That army is incapable of being resisted by the very gods<br>in battle. In today's battle, I fail to keep my judgment clear. Drona<br>also is, with great might, afflicting my forces! Thou seest, O<br>mighty-armed one, how that regenerate one is careering in battle. When<br>several tasks present themselves together, thou art well-skilled in<br>selecting that which would be first attended to. It behoveth thee, O<br>giver of honours, to accomplish with activity that task which is the<br>gravest of all. Amongst all these tasks, I myself think, that this<br>(aiding Arjuna) is the first that demands our attention. The rescue of<br>Arjuna in battle should be first undertaken. I do not grieve for him of<br>Dasarha's race. He is the Protector and the Lord of the Universe. I tell<br>thee truly that tiger among men, O sire, is able to vanquish in battle<br>the three worlds assembled together. What need I say, therefore, of this<br>weak Dhritarashtra host? Arjuna, however, O thou of Vrishni's race, is<br>being afflicted by countless odds in battle. He may yield up his life. It<br>is for this that I am so cheerless. O thou then go in his track, since<br>persons like thee should follow a person like him, at such a season,<br>urged on by one like me. Amongst the foremost ones of the Vrishni race,<br>two are regarded as Atirathas. They are mighty-armed Pradyumna and<br>thyself, O Satwata, that are so famous. In weapons, thou art equal to<br>Narayana himself, and in strength to Sankarshana. In bravery, thou art<br>equal to Dhananjaya, O tiger among men, and surpassest Bhishma and Drona<br>and every one accomplished in battle. O tiger among men, the wise speak<br>of thee, saying. O Madhava, 'There is nothing unachievable by Satyaki.' O<br>thou of great strength, do thou, therefore, that which I say unto thee,<br>viz., obey the wishes of all here, of myself and of Arjuna. It behoveth<br>thee not, O mighty-armed one, to frustrate that wish. Reckless of thy<br>very life, career thou in battle like a hero. O grandson of Sini, the<br>scions of Dasarha's race never care to protect their lives in battle.<br>Avoiding battle, or fighting from behind breast-works, or flying away<br>from battle,&#8212;those practices of cowards and wretches are never practised<br>by the Dasarhas. The virtuous-souled Arjuna is thy superior, O bull among<br>the Sinis! Vasudeva is the superior of both thyself and intelligent<br>Arjuna, Casting my eyes on these two reasons, I say unto thee these<br>words. Do not discard my words, I am the superior of thy superiors. That<br>which I am saying unto thee is approved as also by Arjuna. I tell thee<br>this truly. Go then to the spot where Dhananjaya is. Attending to these<br>words of mine, O thou of prowess incapable of being baffled, penetrate in<br>this host of the wicked son of Dhritarashtra. Having penetrated into it<br>duly, encounter the great car-warriors, and display, O Satwata, such<br>feats as are worthy of thyself!'"
