                            "Narada said, 'Yayati, the son of Nahusha, O Srinjaya, we hear, fell a<br>prey to death. Having performed a hundred Rajasuyas, a hundred<br>Horse-sacrifices, a thousand Pundarikas, a hundred Vajapeyas, a thousand<br>Atiratras, innumerable Chaturmasyas, diverse Agnishtomas, and many other<br>kinds of sacrifices, in all of which he made profuse gifts unto the<br>Brahmanas, he gave away unto the Brahmanas, having counted it first, the<br>whole of the wealth that existed on the earth in the possession of<br>Mlecchas and other Brahmana-hating people. When the gods and the Asuras<br>were arrayed for battle, king Yayati aided the gods. Having divided the<br>earth into four parts, he gave it away unto four persons. Having<br>performed various sacrifices and virtuously begotten excellent offspring<br>upon (his wives) Devayani, the daughter of Usanas and Sarmishtha, king<br>Yayati, who was like unto a celestial, roved through the celestial woods<br>at his own pleasure, like a second Vasava. Acquainted with all the Vedas,<br>when, however, he found that he was not satiated with the indulgence of<br>his passions, he then, with his wives, retired into the forest, saying<br>this: 'Whatever of paddy and wheat and gold and animals and women there<br>are on earth, even the whole of these is not sufficient for one man.<br>Thinking of this, one should cultivate contentment.' Thus abandoning all<br>his desires, and attaining to contentment, the lord Yayati, installing<br>(his son) on his throne, retired into the forest. When he died, O<br>Srinjaya, who was superior to thee in respect of the four cardinal<br>virtues and who, superior to thee, was much superior to thy son, thou<br>shouldst not, saying, 'Oh, Swaitya, Oh, Swaitya', grieve for the latter<br>who performed no sacrifice and made no sacrificial present.'"
