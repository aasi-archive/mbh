                            "Narada said, 'King Suhotra also, O Srinjaya, we hear, fell a prey to<br>death. He was the foremost of heroes, and invincible in battle. The very<br>gods used to come for seeing him. Acquiring his kingdom virtuously, he<br>sought the advice of his Ritwijas and domestic priests and Brahmanas for<br>his own good, and enquiring of them, used to obey their behests.<br>Well-acquainted with the duty of protecting his subjects, possessed of<br>virtue and liberality, performing sacrifices and subjugating foes, king<br>Suhotra wished for the increase of his wealth. He adored the gods by<br>following the ordinances of the scriptures, and defeated his foes by<br>means of his arrows. He gratified all creatures by means of his own<br>excellent accomplishments. He ruled the earth, freeing her from Mlecchas<br>and the forest-thieves.[91] The deity of the clouds showered gold unto<br>him from year's end to year's end. In those olden days, therefore, the<br>rivers (in his kingdom) ran (liquid) gold, and were open to everybody for<br>use.[92] The deity of the clouds showered on his kingdom large number of<br>alligators and crabs and fishes of diverse species and various objects of<br>desire, countless in number, that were all made of gold. The artificial<br>lakes in that king's dominions each measured full two miles. Beholding<br>thousands of dwarfs and humpbacks and alligators and Makaras, and<br>tortoises all made of gold, king Suhotra wondered much. That unlimited<br>wealth of gold, the royal sage Suhotra performing a sacrifice at<br>Kurujangala, gave away unto the Brahmanas, before the completion of the<br>sacrifice. Having performed a thousand Horse-sacrifices, a hundred<br>Rajasuyas, many sacred Kshatriya-sacrifices[93] in all of which he made<br>abundant presents to the Brahmanas and having performed daily rites,<br>almost countless in number, undergone from specified desires, the king<br>ultimately obtained a very desirable end. When, O Srinjaya, such a king<br>died, who was superior to thee as regards the four cardinal virtues and<br>who, superior to thee, was therefore, much superior to thy son, thou<br>shouldst not grieve saying, 'Oh Swaitya, Oh, Swaitya,' for thy son<br>performed no sacrifice and made no sacrificial present.'"
