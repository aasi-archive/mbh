                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then king Yudhishthira, and Bhimasena, the son of Pandu,<br>O monarch, encompassed Drona's son on all sides. Seeing this, king<br>Duryodhana, aided by Bharadwaja's son, rushed against the Pandavas in<br>that encounter. Then commenced a battle that was fierce and terrific,<br>enhancing the fears of the timid. Yudhishthira, in wrath began to<br>despatch vast numbers of Amvashthas, Malavas, Vangas, Sivis, and<br>Trigartas, to the domain of the dead. Bhima also, mangling the<br>Abhishahas, the Surasenas, and other Kshatriyas difficult to defeat in<br>battle, made the earth miry with blood. The diademdecked (Arjuna) of<br>white steeds despatched, O king, the Yaudheyas, the Mountaineers, the<br>Madrakas, and the Malavas also, to the regions of the dead. Forcibly<br>struck with swiftly-coursing shafts, elephants began to fall down on the<br>earth like double-crested hills. Strewn with the lopped-off trunks<br>elephants that still moved in convulsions, the earth seemed as if covered<br>with moving snakes. Covered with the fallen umbrellas of kings that were<br>adorned with gold, the field of battle looked resplendent like the<br>firmament at the end of the Yuga bespangled with suns, moons and stars.<br>About this time a fierce uproar arose near Drona's car, in the midst of<br>which could be heard the words, 'Slay', 'Strike fearlessly', 'Pierce',<br>'cut in pieces'. Drona, however, filled with rage, began to destroy by<br>means of the Vayavya weapon the foes about him, like a mighty tempest<br>destroying gathering masses of clouds. Thus treated by Drona, the<br>Panchalas fled away, from fear, in the very sight to Bhimasena and the<br>high-souled Partha. Then the diadem-decked (Arjuna) and Bhimasena soon<br>checked the flight of their troops and accompanied by a large car-force<br>attacked the vast force of Drona. Vibhatsu attacking the right and<br>Vrikodara the left, they both poured on Bharadwaja's son two dense<br>showers of arrows. The mighty car-warriors among the Srinjayas and the<br>Panchalas, with the Matsyas and the Somakas, O king, followed the two<br>brothers thus engaged (in that encounter with Drona). Similarly, many<br>foremost of car-warriors, skilled in smiting, belonging to thy son,<br>accompanied by a large force, proceeded towards Drona's car (for<br>supporting the latter). Then the Bharata host, slaughtered by the<br>diadem-decked (Arjuna) and overcome with and afflicted by the darkness,<br>began to break. Thy son himself, and Drona, both endevoured to rally<br>them. Thy troops, however, O king, could not be checked in their flight.<br>Indeed, that vast host, slaughtered by the shafts of Pandu's son, began<br>to fly away in all directions in that hour when the world was enveloped<br>with gloom. Many kings, abandoning the animals and vehicles they rode,<br>fled away on all sides, O monarch, overwhelmed with fear'."
