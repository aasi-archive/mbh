                            "Narada said, 'Even the great ascetic Rama, the hero worshipped by all<br>heroes, that son of Jamadagni, of great fame, will die, without being<br>contented (with the period of his life). Rooting out all evils from the<br>earth, he caused the primeval Yuga to set in. Having obtained unrivalled<br>prosperity, no fault could be seen in him.[120] His father having been<br>slain and his calf having been stolen by the Kshatriyas, he without any<br>boast, slew Kartavirya who had never been vanquished before by foes. With<br>his bow he slew four and sixty times ten thousand Kshatriyas already<br>within the jaws of death. In that slaughter were included fourteen<br>thousand Brahmana-hating Kshatriyas of the Dantakura country, all of whom<br>he slew. Of the Haihayas, he slew a thousand with his short club, a<br>thousand with his sword, and a thousand by hanging.[121] Heroic warriors,<br>with their cars, steeds, and elephants, lay dead on the field, slain by<br>the wise son of Jamadagni, enraged at the slaughter of his father. And<br>Rama, on that occasion, slew ten thousand Kshatriyas with his axe. He<br>could not quietly bear the furious speeches uttered by those (foes of<br>his). And when many foremost of Brahmans uttered exclamations, mentioning<br>the name of Rama of Bhrigu's race,[122] then the valiant son of<br>Jamadagni, proceeding against the Kashmiras, the Daradas, the Kuntis, the<br>Kshudrakas, the Malavas, the Angas, the Vangas, the Kalingas, the<br>Videhas, the Tamraliptakas, the Rakshovahas, the Vitahotras, the<br>Trigartas, the Martikavatas, counting by thousand, slew them all by means<br>of his whetted shafts. Proceeding from province to province, fie thus<br>slew thousands of crores of Kshatriyas. Creating a deluge of blood and<br>filling many lakes also with blood as red as Indrajopakas or the wild<br>fruit called Vandujiva, and bringing all the eighteen islands (of which<br>the earth is composed) under his subjection, that son of Bhrigu's race<br>performed a hundred sacrifices of great merit, all of which he completed<br>and in all of which the presents he made unto the Brahmanas were profuse.<br>The sacrificial altar, eighteen nalas high made entirely of gold, and<br>constructed according to the ordinance, full of diverse kinds of jewels<br>and gems, and decked with hundreds of standards, and this earth abounding<br>in domestic and wild animals, were accepted by Kasyapa as sacrificial<br>present made unto him by Rama, the son of Jamadagni. And Rama also gave<br>him many thousand prodigious elephants, all adorned with gold. Indeed,<br>freeing the earth from all robbers, and making her teem with honest and<br>graceful inhabitants, Rama gave her away to Kasyapa at his great<br>Horse-sacrifice. Having divested the earth of Kshatriyas for one and<br>twenty times, and having performed hundreds of sacrifices, the puissant<br>hero gave away the earth to the Brahmanas. And it was Marichi (Kasyapa)<br>who accepted from him the earth with her seven islands. Then Kasyapa said<br>unto Rama, 'Go out of the earth, at my command.' At the word of Kasyapa,<br>the foremost of warriors, desirous of obeying the Brahmana's behest,<br>caused by his arrows the very ocean to stand aside, and repairing to that<br>best of mountains called Mahendra, continued to live there. Even that<br>enhancer of the fame of the Bhrigus, possessed of such numberless<br>virtues, that famous son of Jamadagni, of great splendour, will die.<br>Superior to thy son, (even he will die). Do not, therefore, grieve for<br>thy son who performed no sacrifice and made no sacrificial present. All<br>these, superior to thee as regards the four cardinal virtues and as<br>regards also a hundred other merits, all these foremost of men, have<br>died, O Srinjaya, and they that are like them will also die.'"
