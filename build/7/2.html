                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then Adhiratha's son of the Suta caste, knowing that<br>Bhishma had been slain, became desirous of rescuing, like a brother, thy<br>son's army from the distress into which it had fallen, and which then<br>resembled a boat sunk in the fathomless ocean. [Indeed], O king, having<br>heard that that mighty car-warrior and foremost of men, that hero of<br>unfading glory, viz., Santanu's son, had been thrown down (from his car),<br>that grinder of foes, that foremost of all wielders of bows, viz., Karna,<br>soon came (to the field of battle). When the best of car-warriors, viz.,<br>Bhishma, was slain by the foe, Karna speedily came there, desirous of<br>rescuing the Kuru host which resembled a boat sunk in the ocean, like a<br>sire desirous of rescuing his children.'<br><br>"And Karna (addressing the soldiers) said, 'That Bhishma who possessed<br>firmness, intelligence, prowess, vigour, truth, self-restraint, and all<br>the virtues of a hero, as also celestial weapons, and humidity, and<br>modesty, agreeable speech, and freedom from malice, that ever-grateful<br>Bhishma, that slayer of the foes of Brahmanas, in whom were these<br>attributes as permanently as Lakshmi in the moon, alas, when that<br>Bhishma, that slayer of hostile heroes, hath received his quietus, I<br>regard all other heroes as already slain. In consequence of the eternal<br>connection (of all things) with work, nothing exists in this world that<br>is imperishable. When Bhisma of high vows hath been slain, who is there<br>that would take upon himself to say with certitude that tomorrow's sun<br>will rise? When he that was endued with prowess equal to that of the<br>Vasus, he that was born of the energy of the Vasus, when he, that ruler<br>of the earth, hath once more been united with the Vasus, grieve ye,<br>therefore, for your possessions and children for this earth and the<br>Kurus, and this host.'[4]<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Upon the fall of that boon-giving hero of great<br>might, that lord of the world, viz., Santanu's son of great energy, and<br>upon the (consequent) defeat of the Bharatas, Karna, with cheerless heart<br>and eyes filled with tears, began to console (the Dhartarashtras).<br>Hearing these words of Radha's son, thy sons, O monarch, and thy troops,<br>began to wail aloud and shed copious tears of grief corresponding with<br>the loudness of those wails.[5] When, however, the dreadful battle once<br>more took place and the Kaurava divisions, urged on by the Kings, once<br>more set up loud shouts, that bull among mighty car-warriors, viz.,<br>Karna, then addressed the great car-warriors (of the Kaurava army) and<br>said words which caused them great delight: In this transient world<br>everything is continually flitting (towards the jaws of Death). Thinking<br>of this, I regard everything as ephemeral. When, however, all of you were<br>here, how could Bhishma, that bull among the Kurus, immovable as a hill,<br>be thrown down from his car? When that mighty car-warrior, viz., the son<br>of Santanu, hath been overthrown, who even now lieth on the ground like<br>the Sun himself dropped (from the firmament), the Kuru kings are scarcely<br>competent to bear Dhananjaya, like trees incapable of bearing the<br>mountain-wind. I shall, however, now protect, as that high-souled one<br>did, this helpless Kuru host of cheerless mien, whose foremost warriors<br>have already been slain by the foe. Let this burden now devolve on me. I<br>see that this universe is transient, since that foremost of heroes hath<br>been slain in battle. Why shall I then cherish any fear of battle?<br>Coursing, therefore, on the field I shall despatch those bulls of Kuru's<br>race (viz., the Pandavas) to Yama's abode by means of my straight shafts.<br>Regarding fame as the highest object in the world, I shall slay them in<br>battle, or, slain by the foe, shall sleep on the field. Yudhishthira is<br>possessed of firmness, intelligence, virtue, and might. Vrikodara is<br>equal to a hundred elephant in prowess, Arjuna is young and is the son of<br>the chief of the celestials. The Pandava host, therefore, is not capable<br>of being easily defeated by the very celestials. That force in which are<br>the twins, each resembling Yama himself, that force in which are Satyaki<br>and the son of Devaki, that force is like the jaws of Death. No coward,<br>approaching it, can come back with life. The wise oppose swelling ascetic<br>power with ascetic austerities, so should force be opposed by force.<br>Verily, my mind is firmly fixed upon opposing the foe and protecting my<br>own party, O charioteer, I shall today certainly resist the might of the<br>enemy, and vanquish him by repairing only to the field of battle. I will<br>not tolerate this intestine feud. When the troops are broken, he that<br>cometh (for aiding) in the endeavour to rally is a friend. I shall either<br>achieve this righteous feat worthy of an honest man, or casting off my<br>life shall follow Bhishma. I shall either slay all my foes united<br>together, or slain by them proceed to the regions reserved for heroes. O<br>charioteer, I know that even this is what I should do, when women and<br>children cry for help, or when Duryodhana's prowess sustains a check.<br>Therefore, I shall today conquer the foe. Reckless of my very life in<br>this terrible battle, I shall protect the Kurus and slay the sons of<br>Pandu. Slaying in battle all my foes banded together, I shall bestow<br>(undisputed) sovereignty on Dhritarashtra's son. Let my armour,<br>beautiful, made of gold, bright, and radiant with jewels and gems, be<br>donned; and my head-gear, of effulgence equal to that of the sun; and my<br>bows and arrows that resemble fire, poison, or snakes. Let also sixteen<br>quivers be tied (to my car) at the proper places, and let a number of<br>excellent bows be procured. Let also shafts, and darts and heavy maces,<br>and my conch, variegated with gold, be got ready. Bring also my<br>variegated, beautiful, and excellent standard, made of gold, possessed of<br>the effulgence of the lotus, and bearing the device of the elephant's<br>girth, cleaning it with a delicate cloth, and decking it with excellent<br>garlands and a network of wires.[6] O charioteer's son, bring me also,<br>with speed, some fleet steeds of the hue of tawny clouds, not lean, and<br>bathed in water sanctified with mantras, and furnished with trappings of<br>bright gold. Bring me also, with speed, an excellent car decked with<br>garlands of gold, adorned gems, bright as the sun or the moon, furnished<br>with every necessary, as also with weapons, and unto which are yoked<br>excellent animals. Bring me also a number of excellent bows of great<br>toughness, and a number of excellent bow-strings capable of smitting (the<br>foe), and some quivers, large and full of shafts and some coats of mail<br>for my body. Bring me also, with speed, O hero, every (auspicious)<br>article needed for occasions of setting out (for battle), such as vessels<br>of brass and gold, full of curds. Let garlands of flowers be brought, and<br>let them be put on the (proper) limbs of my body. Let drums also be<br>beaten for victory! Go, O charioteer, quickly to the spot where the<br>diadem-decked (Arjuna), and Vrikodara, and Dharma's son (Yudhishthira),<br>and the twins, are. Encountering them in battle, either I shall slay<br>them, or, being slain by them, my foes, I shall follow Bhishma. Arjuna,<br>and Vasudeva, and Satyaki, and the Srinjayas, that force, I think, is<br>incapable of being conquered by the kings. If all-destroying Death<br>himself with unremitting vigilance, were to protect Kiritin, still shall<br>I slay him, encountering him in battle, or repair myself to Yama's abode<br>by Bhishma's track. Verily, I say, that I will repair into the midst of<br>those heroes. Those (kings) that are my allies are not provokers of<br>intestine feuds, or of weak attachment to me, or of unrighteous souls.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, Riding on an excellent and costly car of great<br>strength, with an excellent pole, decked with gold, auspicious, furnished<br>with a standard, and unto which were yoked excellent steeds that were<br>fleet as the wind, Karna proceeded (to battle) for victory. Worshipped by<br>the foremost of Kuru car-warriors like Indra by the celestials, that<br>high-souled and fierce bowman, endued with immeasurable energy like the<br>Sun himself, upon his car decked with gold and jewels and gems, furnished<br>with an excellent standard, unto which were yoked excellent steeds, and<br>whose rattle resembled the roll of the clouds, proceeded, accompanied by<br>a large force, to that field of battle where that bull of Bharata's race<br>(Bhishma) had paid his debt to nature. Of beautiful person, and endued<br>with the splendour of fire, that great bowman and mighty car-warrior,<br>viz., the son of Adhiratha, then mounted on his own beautiful car<br>possessed of the effulgence of fire, and shone like the lord of the<br>celestials himself riding on his celestial car.'"
