                            "Sanjaya said, 'In that fierce and terrible battle, Dhrishtadyumna, O<br>king, proceeded against Drona. Holding his formidable bow and repeatedly<br>stretching his bowstring, the Panchala prince rushed towards Drona's car<br>decked with gold. And as Dhrishtadyumna proceeded for accomplishing the<br>destruction of Drona, the Panchalas and the Pandavas, O king, surrounded<br>him. Beholding Drona, that foremost of preceptors, thus assailed, thy<br>son, resolutely contending in battle, protected Drona on all sides. Then<br>those two oceans of troops encountered each other on that night, looked<br>like two terrible oceans lashed into fury by tempest, with all living<br>creatures within them exceedingly agitated. Then the prince of the<br>Panchalas, O king, quickly pierced Drona in the chest with five arrows<br>and uttered a leonine roar. Drona, however, O Bharata, piercing his foe<br>in return with five and twenty arrows in that battle, cut off, with<br>another broad-headed arrow, his bright bow. Forcibly pierced by Drona, O<br>bull of Bharata's race, Dhrishtadyumna, quickly casting aside his bow,<br>bit his (nether) lip in rage. Indeed, O monarch, the valiant<br>Dhrishtadyumna, excited with wrath, took up another formidable bow for<br>accomplishing the destruction of Drona. That slayer of hostile heroes,<br>that warrior endued with great beauty, stretching that formidable bow to<br>his ear, shot a terrible shaft capable of taking Drona's life. That<br>shaft, thus sped by the mighty prince in that fierce and dreadful battle,<br>illumined the whole army like the risen sun. Beholding that terrible<br>shaft, the gods, the Gandharvas, and the Danavas. said these words, O<br>king, viz., 'Prosperity to Drona!' Karna, however, O king, displaying<br>great lightness of hand cut off into dozen fragments that shaft as it<br>coursed towards the preceptor's car. Thus cut off into many fragments, O<br>king, that shaft of Dhrishtadyumna, O sire, quickly fell down on the<br>earth like a snake without poison. Having cut off with his own straight<br>shafts those of Dhrishtadyumna in that battle, Karna then pierced<br>Dhrishtadyumna himself with many sharp arrows. And Drona's son pierced<br>him with five, and Drona himself with five, and Salya pierced him with<br>nine, and Duhsasana with three. And Duryodhana pierced him with twenty<br>arrows and Sakuni with five. Indeed, all those mighty car-warriors<br>quickly pierced the prince of the Panchalas. Thus was he pierced by these<br>seven heroes in that battle exerting themselves for the rescue of Drona.<br>The prince of the Panchalas, however, pierced every one of these heroes<br>with three arrows. Indeed, O king, Dhrishtadyumna, in that dreadful<br>battle, quickly pierced Drona himself, and Karna, and Drona's son, and<br>thy son. Thus pierced by that bowman, those warriors, fighting together,<br>pierced Dhrishtadyumna again in that encounter, uttering loud roars the<br>while. Then Drumasena, excited with wrath, O king, pierced the Panchala<br>prince with a winged arrow, and once again quickly with three other<br>arrows. And addressing the prince, he said, 'Wait! Wait!' Dhrishtadyumna<br>then pierced Drumasena in return with three straight arrows, in the<br>encounter, which were equipped with wings of gold, steeped in oil, and<br>capable of taking the life of him at whom they are sped. With another<br>broad-headed shaft, the prince of the Panchalas then, in that battle, cut<br>off from Drumasena's trunk the latter's head decked with bright ear-rings<br>of gold. That head, with (the lower) lip bit (in rage), fell on the<br>ground like a ripe palmyra fruit separated from the stalk by the action<br>of a strong wind. Once again, piercing all those warriors with keen<br>shafts, that hero, with some broad-headed shafts, cut off the bow of<br>Radha's son, that warrior conversant with all modes of warfare. Karna<br>could not book that cutting off of his bow, like a fierce lion incapable<br>of brooking the cutting off of his tail. Taking up another bow, Karna,<br>with eyes red in rage, and breathing hard, covered mighty Dhrishtadyumna<br>with clouds of arrows. Beholding Karna excited with rage, those heroes,<br>viz., those six bulls among car-warriors, quickly encompassed the prince<br>of the Panchalas from desire of slaying him. Seeing the latter in front<br>of those six foremost warriors of thy side, all thy troops, O lord,<br>regarded him to be already within the jaws of the Destroyer. Meanwhile,<br>Satyaki, of the Dasarha race, scattering his shafts as he proceeded,<br>reached the spot where, the valiant Dhrishtadyumna was battling.<br>Beholding that invincible warrior of the Satwata race advancing, Radha's<br>son pierced him in that battle with ten arrows. Satyaki, then, O king,<br>pierced Karna with ten shafts in the very sight of all those heroes, and<br>addressing him, said, 'Do not fly away but stay before me.' The encounter<br>then, that took place between mighty Satyaki and the industrious Karna,<br>resembled, O king, that between Vali and Vasava (in the days of yore).<br>That bull among Kshatriyas, viz., Satyaki, terrifying all the Kshatriyas<br>with the rattle of his car, pierced the lotus-eyed Karna in return (with<br>many arrows). Making the earth tremble with the twang of his bow, the<br>mighty son of the Suta, O monarch, contended with Satyaki. Indeed, Karna<br>pierced the grandson of Sini in return with hundreds of long, and barbed,<br>and pointed, and tall-toothed, and razor-headed arrows and diverse other<br>shafts. Similarly, that foremost one of Vrishni's race, Yuyudhana, in<br>that battle, shrouded Karna with his arrows. For a time that battle<br>proceeded equally. Then thy son, O monarch, placing Karna at their head,<br>all pierced Satyaki from every side with keen arrows. Resisting with his<br>own weapons those of them all and of Karna also, O lord, Satyaki quickly<br>pierced Vrishasena in the centre of the chest. Pierced with that arrow,<br>the valiant Vrishasena, of great splendour, quickly fell down on his car,<br>casting aside his bow. Then Karna, believing that mighty car-warrior,<br>viz., Vrishasena, slain, became scorched with grief on account of the<br>death of his son and began to afflict Satyaki with great force. Thus<br>afflicted by Karna, the mighty car-warrior Yuyudhana, with great speed,<br>repeatedly pierced Karna with many shafts. Once more piercing Karna with<br>ten arrows, and Vrishasena with five, the Satwata hero cut off the<br>leathern fences and the bows of both sire and son. Then those two<br>warriors, stringing two other bows, capable of inspiring enemies with<br>terror, began to pierce Yuyudhana from every side with keen shafts.<br>During the progress of that fierce conflict that was so destructive of<br>heroes the loud twang of Gandiva, O king, was heard over every other<br>sound. Hearing then the rattle of Arjuna's car as also that twang of<br>Gandiva, the Suta's son, O king, said these words unto Duryodhana,<br>'Slaughtering our entire army and the foremost of heroic warriors and<br>many mighty bowmen among the Kauravas, Arjuna is loudly twanging his bow.<br>The rattle also of his car is heard, resembling the roar of the thunder.<br>It's evident, the son of Pandu is achieving feats worthy of his own self<br>This son of Pritha, O monarch, will grind our large host. Many of our<br>troops are already breaking. No one stays in battle. Indeed, our army is<br>being dispersed like a risen mass of clouds dispersed by the wind.<br>Encountering Arjuna, our host breaks like a boat on the ocean. The loud<br>wails, O king, of the foremost of warriors, O monarch, flying away from<br>the field, or falling down in consequence of the arrows sped from<br>Gandiva, are being heard. Hear, O tiger among car-warriors, the sound of<br>drums and cymbals near Arjuna's car at dead of night, resembling the deep<br>roll of thunder in the welkin. Hear also the loud wails (of afflicted<br>combatants) and the tremendous leonine shouts, and diverse other noises<br>in the vicinity of Arjuna's car. Here, however, this Satyaki, this<br>foremost one of the Satwata race, stayeth amid us. If this object of our<br>aim can be struck down, we can then vanquish all our foes. Similarly, the<br>son of the Panchala king is engaged with Drona. He is encompassed on all<br>sides by many heroic and foremost of car-warriors. If we can slay Satyaki<br>and Dhrishtadyumna, the son of Prishata without doubt, O king, victory<br>will be ours. Surrounding these two heroes, these two mighty<br>car-warriors, as we did the son of Subhadra we will strive, O king, to<br>slay them, viz., this son of Vrishni's race and this son of Prishata.<br>Savyasachin, O Bharata, is before us, coming towards this division of<br>Drona, knowing that Satyaki is engaged here with many chief among the<br>Kurus. Let a large number of our foremost of car-warriors proceed<br>thither, so that Partha may not be able to come to the rescue of Satyaki,<br>now encompassed by many. Let these great heroes speedily shoot clouds of<br>shafts with great force, so that Satyaki of Madhu's race may by speedily<br>despatched to Yama's abode.' Ascertaining this to be the opinion of<br>Karna, thy son, addressing Suvala's son in the battle, like the<br>illustrious Indra addressing Vishnu, said these words, Surrounded by ten<br>thousand unretreating elephants and ten thousand cars also, proceed<br>against Dhananjaya! Duhsasana and Durvishaha and Suvahu and<br>Dushpradharshana&#8212;these will follow thee, surrounded by a large number of<br>foot-soldiers. O uncle, slay those great bowmen, viz., the two Krishnas,<br>and Yudhishtira, and Nakula, and Sahadeva, and Bhima, the son of Pandu My<br>hope of victory resteth on thee, like that of the gods on their chief<br>Indra. O uncle, slay the son of Kunti, like (Kartikeya) slaying the<br>Asuras.' Thus addressed and urged by thy son, Sakuni, clad in mail,<br>proceeded against the Parthas, accompanied by a large force as also by<br>thy sons, in order to consume the sons of Pandu. Then commenced a great<br>battle between the warriors of thy army and the foe. When Suvala's son, O<br>king, (thus) proceeded against the Pandavas, the Suta's son, accompanied<br>by a large force, quickly advanced against Satyaki, shooting many<br>hundreds of shafts. Indeed, thy warriors, combining together, encompassed<br>Satyaki. Then Bharadwaja's son, proceeding against the car of<br>Dhrishtadyumna, fought a wonderful and fierce battle at dead of night, O<br>bull of Bharata's race, with the brave Dhrishtadyumna and the Panchalas.'"
