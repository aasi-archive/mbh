                            "Sanjaya said, 'Hearing the twang, resembling the loud call of Death<br>himself or the frightful peal of Indra's thunder, of Dhananjaya's bow,<br>while he stretched it, that host of thine, O king, anxious with fear and<br>exceedingly agitated, became like the waters of the sea with fishes and<br>makaras within them, ruffled into mountain-like waves and lashed into<br>fury by the hurricane that arises at the end of the Yuga. Then<br>Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, careered in battle in such a way that he<br>was seen at the same time to be present in all directions, displaying his<br>wonderful weapons. Indeed, so light-handed was the son of Pandu that we<br>could not mark when he took out his shafts, O king, when he fixed them on<br>the bow-string, when he stretched the bow, and when he let them off. Then<br>the mighty-armed one, O king, excited with wrath, invoked into existence<br>the invincible Aindra weapon, frightening all the Bharatas. Hundreds and<br>thousands of blazing shafts of fiery mouths, inspired by mantras with the<br>force of celestial weapons, flowed from it. With those shafts resembling<br>fire or the rays of the sun, coursing with fierce impetuosity, the welkin<br>became incapable of being gazed at, as if filled with flashing meteors.<br>Then that darkness which had been caused by the Katirava with their<br>arrows, which was incapable of being dispersed even in imagination by<br>others, the son of Pandu, careering around and displaying his prowess,<br>destroyed by means of those shafts of his that were inspired by means of<br>mantras with the force of celestial weapons, like the sun himself<br>speedily dispersing at dawn of day the darkness of night by means of his<br>rays. Then the puissant Arjuna, with those blazing shafts of his, sucked<br>the lives of thy warriors like the summer sun sucking with his hot rays<br>the waters of tanks and lakes. Indeed, showers of shafts endued with the<br>force of celestial weapons, (shot by Arjuna) covered the hostile army<br>like the rays of the sun covering the earth. Other arrows of fierce<br>energy, sped (by Dhananjaya), quickly entered the hearts of (hostile)<br>heroes, like dear friends. Indeed, those brave warriors that came in that<br>battle before Arjuna, all perished like insects approaching a blazing<br>fire. Thus crushing the lives of his foes and their fame, Partha careered<br>in that battle like Death in embodied form. Heads decked with diadems,<br>massive arms, adorned with Angadas, and ears with ear-rings of the foes,<br>Partha, cut off with his shafts. The arms, with spears, of<br>elephant-riders; those, with lances, of horsemen; those, with shields, of<br>foot-soldiers; those with bows, of car-warriors; and those, with whips<br>and goads, of charioteers the son of Pandu cut off. Indeed, Dhananjaya<br>looked resplendent with his shafts of blazing points that seemed to<br>constitute his rays, like a blazing fire with incessant sparks and rising<br>flames. The hostile kings, mustering all their resolution, could not even<br>gaze at Dhananjaya, that foremost of all bearers of arms, that hero equal<br>to the chief of the gods himself, that bull among men, seen at the same<br>time in all directions on his car, scattering his mighty weapons, dancing<br>in the tract of his car, and producing deafening sounds with his<br>bowstring and palms, and resembling the midday sun of scorching rays in<br>the firmament. Bearing his shafts of blazing points, the diadem-decked<br>Arjuna looked beautiful like a mighty mass of rain-charged clouds in the<br>season of rains decked with a rainbow. When that perfect flood of mighty<br>weapons was set in motion by Jishnu, many bulls among warriors sank in<br>that frightful and unfordable flood. Strewn with infuriated elephants<br>whose trunks or tusks had been cut off, with steeds deprived of hoofs or<br>necks, with cars reduced to pieces, with warriors having their entrails<br>drawn out and others with legs or other limbs cut off, with bodies lying<br>in hundreds and thousands that were either perfectly still or moving<br>unconsciously, we beheld the vast field, on which Partha battled,<br>resembled the coveted arena of Death, O king, enhancing the terrors of<br>the timid, or like the sporting ground of Rudra when he destroyed<br>creatures in days of old. Portions of the field, strewn with the trunks<br>of elephants cut off with razor-headed arrows, looked as if strewn with<br>snakes. Portions, again, covered with the cut-off heads of warriors,<br>looked as if strewn with garlands of lotuses. Variegated with beautiful<br>head-gear and crowns, Keyuras and Angadas and car-rings with coats of<br>mail decked with gold, and with the trappings and other ornaments of<br>elephants and steeds, and scattered over with hundreds of diadems, lying<br>here and there, and the earth looked exceedingly beautiful like a new<br>bride. Dhananjaya then caused a fierce and terrible river full of fearful<br>objects and enhancing the fear of the timid, to flow resembling the<br>Vaitarani itself. The marrow and fat (of men and animals) formed its<br>mire. Blood formed its current. Full of limbs and bones, it was<br>fathomless in depth. The hairs of creatures formed its moss and weeds.<br>Heads and arms formed the stones on its shores. It was decked with<br>standards and banners that variegated its aspect. Umbrellas and bows<br>formed the waves. And it abounded with bodies of huge elephants deprived<br>of life, and it teemed with cars that formed hundreds of rafts floating<br>on its surface. And the carcases of countless steeds formed its banks.<br>And it was difficult to cross in consequence of wheels and yokes and<br>shafts and Akshas and Kuveras of cars, and spears and swords and darts<br>and battle-axes and shafts looking like snakes. And ravens and kankas<br>formed its alligators. And jackals, forming its Makaras, made in<br>terrible. And fierce vultures formed its sharks. And it became frightful<br>in consequence of the howls of jackals. And it abounded with capering<br>ghosts and Pisachas and thousands of other kinds of spirits. And on it<br>floated countless bodies of warriors destitute of life. Beholding that<br>prowess of Arjuna whose visage then resembled that of the Destroyer<br>himself, a panic, such as had never occurred before, possessed the Kurus<br>on the field of battle. The son of Pandu, then, baffling with his weapons<br>those of the hostile heroes, and engaged in achieving fierce feats, gave<br>all to understand that he was a warrior of fierce feats. Then Arjuna<br>transgressed all those foremost of car-warriors, like the midday sun of<br>scorching rays in the firmament, no one amongst the creatures there could<br>even look at him. The shafts issuing out of the bow Gandiva of that<br>illustrious hero in that battle, seemed to us to resemble a row of cranes<br>in the welkin. Baffling with his own the weapons of all those heroes, and<br>showing by the terrible achievements in which he was engaged that he was<br>a warrior of fierce feats. Arjuna, desirous of slaying Jayadratha,<br>transgressed all those foremost of car-warriors, stupefying them all by<br>means of his shafts. Shooting his shafts on all sides, Dhananjaya, having<br>Krishna for his charioteer, presented a beautiful sight by careering with<br>great speed on the field of battle. The shafts in the welkin, by hundreds<br>and thousands, of that illustrious hero, seemed to course incessantly<br>through the sky. We never could notice when that mighty bowman took out<br>his shafts, when indeed, that son of Pandu aimed them, and when he let<br>them off. Then, O king, filling all the points of the compass with his<br>shafts and afflicting all the car-warriors in battle, the son of Kunti<br>proceeded towards Jayadratha and pierced him with four and sixty straight<br>arrows. Then the Kuru warriors, beholding the son of Pandu proceeded<br>towards Jayadratha, all abstained from battle. In fact, those heroes<br>became hopeless of Jayadratha's life. Every one amongst thy warriors that<br>rushed in that fierce battle against the son of Pandu, had his body<br>deeply pierced, O lord, with a shaft of Arjuna. The mighty car-warrior<br>Arjuna, that foremost of victorious persons, with his shafts blazing as<br>fire made thy army teem with headless trunks.[175] Indeed, O king, thus<br>creating a perfect confusion in thy host consisting of four kinds of<br>forces, the son of Kunti proceeded towards Jayadratha, And he pierced the<br>son of Drona. with fifty shafts and Vrishasena with three. And the son of<br>Kunti mildly struck Kripa with nine arrows, and he struck Salya with<br>sixteen arrows and Karna with two and thirty. And piercing the ruler of<br>the Sindhus then with four and sixty arrows, he uttered a leonine shout.<br>The ruler of the Sindhus, however, thus pierced by the wielder of Gandiva<br>with his arrows, became filled with rage and unable to brook it, like an<br>elephant when pierced with the hook. Bearing the device of the boar on<br>his banner, he quickly sped towards Phalguna's car many straight shafts<br>equipped with vulturine feathers, resembling angry snakes of virulent<br>poison, well-polished by the hands of the smith, and shot from his bow<br>drawn to the fullest stretch. Then piercing Govinda with three shafts, he<br>struck Arjuna with six. And then he pierced the steeds of Arjuna with<br>eight arrows and his standard also with one. Then Arjuna, baffling the<br>keen arrows sped by the ruler of the Sindhus, cut off at the same time,<br>with a pair of shafts, the head of Jayadratha's driver and the<br>well-decked standard also of Jayadratha. Its stay cut off and itself<br>pierced and struck with arrows, that standard fell down like a flame of<br>fire. Meanwhile, the sun was going down quickly. Janardana then quickly<br>addressed the son of Pandu and said, 'Behold, O Partha, the ruler of the<br>Sindhus hath, by six mighty and heroic car-warriors, been placed in<br>their-midst! Jayadratha also, O mighty-armed one, is waiting there in<br>fear! Without vanquishing those six car-warriors in battle, O bull among<br>men, thou wilt never be able to slay the ruler of the Sindhus even if<br>thou exertest thyself without intermission. I shall, therefore, resort to<br>Yoga for shrouding the sun. Then the ruler of the Sindhus will (in<br>consequence) behold the sun to have set. Desirous of life, O lord,<br>through joy that wicked wight will no longer, for his destruction,<br>conceal himself. Availing yourself of that opportunity, thou shouldst<br>then, O best of the Kurus, strike him. Thou shouldst not give up the<br>enterprise, thinking the sun to have really set.' Hearing these words,<br>Vibhatsu replied unto Kesava, saying, 'Let it be so.' Then Krishna<br>otherwise called Hari, possessed of ascetic powers, that lord of all<br>ascetics, having taken recourse to Yoga, created that darkness. Thy<br>warriors, O king, thinking the sun to have set were filled with delight<br>at the prospect of Partha's laying down his life. Indeed, thy warriors,<br>not seeing the sun, were filled with gladness. All of them stood, with<br>heads thrown backwards. King Jayadratha also was in the same attitude.<br>And while the ruler of the Sindhus was thus beholding the sun, Krishna,<br>once more addressing Dhananjaya said these words, 'Behold, the heroic<br>ruler of the Sindhus is now looking at the sun, casting off his fear of<br>thee, O foremost one among the Bharatas! This is the hour, O mighty-armed<br>one, for the slaughter of that wicked-souled wretch. Speedily cut off the<br>head and make thy vow true.' Thus addressed by Kesava the valiant son of<br>Pandu began to slaughter thy host with his arrows resembling the sun or<br>fire in splendour. And he pierced Kripa with twenty arrows and Karna with<br>fifty. And he struck Salya and Duryodhana each with six. And he pierced<br>Vrishasena with eight arrows and the ruler of the Sindhus himself with<br>sixty. And the mighty-armed son of Pandu, O king, deeply piercing with<br>his arrows the other warriors of thy host, rushed against Jayadratha.<br>Beholding him in their presence like a swelling fire with its tongue of<br>flame outstretched, the protectors of Jayadratha were sorely puzzled.<br>Then all the warriors, O king, desirous of victory bathed the son of<br>Indra in that battle with torrents of arrows. Shrouded with incessant<br>showers of arrows, the son of Kunti, that mighty-armed and unvanquished<br>descendant of Kuru, became filled with rage. Then that tiger among men,<br>viz., the son of Indra, desirous of slaughtering thy host, created a<br>thick net of arrows. Then those warriors of thine, O king, thus<br>slaughtered in battle by that hero, abandoned the ruler of the Sindhus in<br>fear and fled away. And they fled away in such a manner that no two<br>persons could be seen flying together. The prowess that we then beheld of<br>Kunti's son was extremely wonderful. Indeed, the like of what that<br>illustrious warrior then did had never been nor will ever be. Like Rudra<br>himself slaughtering creatures, Dhananjaya slaughtered elephants and<br>elephant-riders, horses and horse-riders, and (car-warriors and)<br>car-drivers. I did not in that battle, O king, see a single elephant or<br>steed or human warrior that was not struck with Partha's shafts. Their<br>vision blurred by dust and darkness, thy warriors became perfectly<br>cheerless and unable to distinguish one another. Urged on by fate and<br>with their vital limbs cut open and mangled with shafts, they began to<br>wander or, limp, or fall down. And some amongst them, O Bharata, became<br>paralysed and some became deathly pale. During that terrible carnage<br>resembling the slaughter of creatures at the end of the Yuga, in that<br>deadly and fierce battle from which few could escape with life, the earth<br>became drenched with gore and the earthy dust that had arisen disappeared<br>in consequence of the showers of blood that fell and the swift currents<br>of wind that blew over the field. So deep was that rain of blood that the<br>wheels of cars sank to their naves. Thousands of infuriated elephants<br>endued with great speed, O king, of thy army, their riders slain and<br>limbs mangled, fled away, uttering cries of pain and crushing friendly<br>ranks with their tread. Steeds destitute of riders and foot-soldiers<br>also, O king, fled away, O monarch, from fear, struck with the shafts of<br>Dhananjaya. Indeed, thy soldiers, with dishevelled hair and deprived of<br>their coats of mail, with blood streaming out of their wounds, fled away<br>in terror, leaving the field of battle. And some, deprived of the power<br>of motion as if their lower limbs had been seized by alligators, remained<br>on the field. And others concealed themselves behind and under the bodies<br>of slain elephants Routing thy host thus, O king, Dhananjaya began to<br>strike with terrible shafts the protectors of the ruler of the Sindhus<br>with his arrowy showers, Karna and Drona's son and Kripa and Salya and<br>Vrishasena and Duryodhana. So quick was he in the use of weapons that no<br>one could mark when Arjuna took out his arrows, when he fixed them on the<br>bowstring, when he stretched&#8212;-the bow and let them off. Indeed, while<br>striking the foe, his bow was seen incessantly drawn to a circle. His<br>arrows also were seen incessantly issuing out of his bow and scattered in<br>all directions. Then cutting off Karna's bow as also of Vrishasena's,<br>Arjuna felled Salya's driver from his niche in the car, with a<br>broad-headed arrow. With many arrows that foremost of victors, viz.,<br>Dhananjaya, then deeply pierced in that battle Kripa and Aswatthaman,<br>related as uncle and nephew to each other. Sorely afflicting those mighty<br>car-warriors of thy army thus, the son of Pandu took up a terrible arrow<br>of fiery splendour. Looking like the thunderbolt of Indra, and inspired<br>with divine mantras, that formidable arrow was capable of bearing any<br>strain. And it had been always worshipped with incense and garlands of<br>flowers. Duly inspiring it (by mantras) with the force of the<br>thunderbolt, that descendant, of Kuru, viz., the mighty-armed Arjuna,<br>fixed it on Gandiva. When that arrow of fiery effulgence was fixed on the<br>bowstring, loud shouts, O king, were heard in the welkin. Then Janardana,<br>once more addressing Arjuna, quickly said, 'O Dhananjaya, quickly cut off<br>the head of the wicked-souled ruler of the Sindhus! The sun is about to<br>get at the mountain of Asta. Listen, however, to the words I say about<br>the slaughter of Jayadratha. The father of Jayadratha is Vriddhakshatra<br>known all over the world. It was after a long time that he got<br>Jayadratha, that slayer of foes, for his son. (At the birth of the son)<br>an incorporeal and invisible voice, deep as that of the clouds or of the<br>drum, said unto king Vriddhakshatra. 'This thy son, O lord, amongst men<br>in this world will become worthy of the two races (viz., the Solar and<br>the Lunar) in respect of blood, behaviour, self-restraint and the other<br>attributes. He will become one of the foremost of Kshatriyas, and will<br>always be worshipped by heroes. But while struggling in battle, some bull<br>among the Kshatriyas, some conspicuous person in the world, excited with<br>wrath, will cut off this one's head.' That chastiser of foes, viz., the<br>(old) ruler of the Sindhus, hearing these words, reflected for sometime.<br>Overwhelmed with affection for his son, he summoned all his kinsmen and<br>said, 'That man who will cause the head of my son to fall on the earth<br>while the latter, struggling in battle, will be bearing a great burthen,<br>I say that the head of that man will certainly crack into a hundred<br>pieces.' Having spoken these words and installed Jayadratha on the<br>throne, Vriddhakshatra, repairing to the woods, devoted himself to<br>ascetic austerities. Endued with great energy, he is still engaged in the<br>observance of the austerest of penances outside this very<br>Samantapanchaka, O ape-bannered one! Therefore, cutting off Jayadratha's<br>head in this dreadful battle, thou, O slayer of foes, shouldst, O<br>Bharata, by thy fierce celestial weapon of wonderful feats, quickly throw<br>that head decked with car-rings upon the lap of Vriddhakshatra himself, O<br>younger brother of the son of the Wind-god! If thou fellest Jayadratha's<br>head on the earth, thy own head, then, without doubt, will crack into a<br>hundred fragments. Aided by thy celestial weapon, do thee deed in such a<br>way that the lord of earth viz., the old Sindhu king, may not know that<br>it is done. Truly, O Arjuna, there is nothing in the three worlds which<br>thou canst not achieve or do, O son of Vasava!' Hearing these words (of<br>Krishna), Dhananjaya, licking the corners of his mouth, quickly shot that<br>arrow which he had taken up for Jayadratha's slaughter, that arrow, viz.,<br>whose touch resembled that of Indra's thunder, which was inspired with<br>mantras and converted into a celestial weapon, which was capable of<br>bearing any strain, and which had always been worshipped with incense and<br>garlands. That shaft, sped from Gandiva, coursing swiftly, snatched<br>Jayadratha's head away, like a hawk snatching away a smaller bird from<br>the top of a tree. Dhananjaya, then, with his shafts, sent that head<br>along in the welkin (without allowing it to fall down). For grieving his<br>foes and gladdening his friends, the son of Pandu, by shooting his shafts<br>repeatedly at it, sent that head outside the limits of Samantapanchaka.<br>Meanwhile, king Vriddhakshatra, the father of thy son-in-law, endued with<br>great energy, was, O sire, engaged in his evening prayers. Decked with<br>black locks and adorned with ear-rings, that head of Jayadratha was<br>thrown upon Vriddhakshatra's lap, as the latter was saying his prayers in<br>a sitting posture. Thus thrown on his lap, that head decked with<br>car-rings, O chastiser of foes, was not seen by king Vriddhakshatra. As<br>the latter, however, stood up after finishing his prayers it suddenly<br>fell down on the earth. And as the head of Jayadratha fell down on the<br>earth, the head of Vriddhakshatra, O chastiser of foes, cracked into a<br>hundred pieces. At the sight of this, all creatures were filled with<br>wonder. And all of them applauded Vasudeva and the mighty Vibhatsu.<br><br>"After, O king, the ruler of the Sindhus had been slain by the<br>diadem-decked Arjuna, that darkness, O bull of Bharata's race, was<br>withdrawn by Vasudeva. Thy sons with their followers, O king, thus, came<br>to know subsequently that the darkness, they had seen, had all been an<br>illusion produced by Vasudeva. Even thus, O king, was thy son-in-law, the<br>ruler of the Sindhus, having caused eight Akshauhinis to be slaughtered,<br>himself slain by Partha of inconceivable energy. Beholding Jayadratha,<br>the ruler of the Sindhus slain, tears of sorrow fell from the eyes of thy<br>sons. After Jayadratha, O king, had been slain by Partha, Kesava blew his<br>conch and that scorcher of foes, viz., the mighty-armed Arjuna also blew<br>his; Bhimasena also, in that battle, as if for sending a message to<br>Yudhishthira, filled the welkin with a tremendous leonine shout.<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma, bearing that tremendous shout understood<br>that the ruler of the Sindhus had been slain by the high-souled Phalguna.<br>With sounds of drums and other instruments he gladdened the warriors of<br>his own army, and proceeded against the son of Bharadwaja from desire of<br>battle. Then commenced, O king, after the sun had set, a fierce battle<br>between Drona and the Somakas, that made the very hair stand on end.<br>Desirous of slaying him, those mighty car-warriors after the fall of<br>Jayadratha, fought with the son of Bharadwaja, exerting themselves to<br>their utmost. Indeed, the Pandavas, having got the victory by slaying the<br>ruler of the Sindhus fought with Drona, intoxicated with success. Arjuna,<br>also, O king, having slain king Jayadratha, fought with many mighty<br>car-warriors of thy army. Indeed, that hero decked with diadem and<br>garlands, having accomplished his former vow, began to destroy his foes<br>like the chief of the celestials destroying the Danavas, or the sun<br>destroying darkness.'
