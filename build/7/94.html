                            "Sanjaya said, 'After that bull among men, viz., Duryodhana, had set out<br>from behind, following Partha and him of Vrishni's race, O king, both of<br>whom had penetrated into the Kaurava army, the Pandavas accompanied by<br>the Somakas, quickly rushed against Drona with loud shouts. And then<br>commenced the battle (between them and Drona's troops). And the battle<br>that took place between the Kurus and the Pandavas at the gate of the<br>array, was fierce and awful, making the hair stand on end. The sight<br>filled the spectators with wonder. O king, the sun was then in the<br>meridian. That encounter, O monarch, was truly such that we had never<br>seen or heard of its like before. The Parthas headed by Dhrishtadyumna,<br>all accomplished in smiting and arrayed properly covered the troops of<br>Drona with showers of arrows. Ourselves also, placing Drona, that<br>foremost of all wielders of weapons, at our head, covered the Parthas,<br>gathered by Prishata's son, with our shafts. The two hosts, adorned with<br>cars and looking beautiful, then appeared like two mighty masses of<br>clouds in the summer sky, driven towards each other by opposite winds.<br>Encountering each other, the two hosts increased their impetuosity, like<br>the rivers the Ganga and the Yamuna, swollen with water during the season<br>of the rains. Having diverse kinds of weapons for the winds that ran<br>before them, teeming with elephants and steeds and cars charged with<br>lightning, constituted by the maces wielded by the warriors, the fierce<br>and mighty cloud formed by the Kuru host, urged on by the Drona-tempest,<br>and pouring incessant shafts that constituted its torrents of rain,<br>sought to quench the scorching Pandava-fire. Like an awful hurricane in<br>summer agitating the ocean, that best of Brahmanas, viz., Drona,<br>agitating the Pandava host. Exerting themselves with great vigour, the<br>Pandavas rushed towards Drona alone for piercing his host, like a mighty<br>torrent of water towards a strong embankment, for sweeping it away. Like<br>an immovable hill resisting the fiercest current of water, Drona,<br>however, resisted in that battle the enraged Pandavas and Panchalas and<br>Kekayas. Many other kings also, endued with great strength and courage,<br>attacking them from all sides, began to resist the Pandavas. Then that<br>tiger among men, viz., the son of Prishata, uniting with the Pandayas,<br>began repeatedly to strike Drona, for piercing the hostile host. Indeed,<br>as Drona showered his arrows on Prishata's son, even so did the latter<br>shower his on Drona. Having scimitars and swords for the winds that blew<br>before it, well-equipped with darts and lances and sabres, with the<br>bow-string constituting its lightning, and the (twang of the) bow for its<br>roars, the Dhrishtadyumna-cloud poured on all sides torrents of weapons,<br>as its showers of stones. Slaying the foremost of car-warriors and a<br>large number of steeds, the son of Prishata seemed to deluge the hostile<br>divisions (with his arrowy downpours). And the son of Prishata, by his<br>arrows, turned Drona away from all those tracks amid the car-divisions of<br>the Pandavas, through which that hero attempted to pass, striking the<br>warriors there with his shafts. And although Drona struggled vigorously<br>in that battle, yet his host, encountering Dhrishtadyumna, became divided<br>into three columns. One of these retreated towards Kritavarman, the chief<br>of the Bhojas; another towards Jalasandha; and fiercely slaughtered the<br>while by the Pandavas, proceeded towards Drona himself. Drona, that<br>foremost of car-warriors, repeatedly united his troops. The mighty<br>warrior Dhrishtadyumna as often smote and separated them. Indeed, the<br>Dhartarashtra force, divided into three bodies, was slaughtered by the<br>Pandavas and the Srinjayas fiercely, like a herd of cattle in the woods<br>by many beasts of prey, when unprotected by herdsmen. And people thought<br>that in that dreadful battle, it was Death himself who was swallowing the<br>warriors first stupefied by Dhrishtadyumna. As a kingdom of a bad king is<br>destroyed by famine and pestilence and robbers, even so was thy host<br>afflicted by the Pandavas. And in consequence of the rays of the sun<br>failing upon the weapons and the warriors, and of the dust raised by the<br>soldiers, the eyes of all were painfully afflicted. Upon the Kaurava host<br>being divided into three bodies during that dreadful carnage by the<br>Pandavas, Drona, filled with wrath, began to consume the Panchalas with<br>his shafts. And while engaged in crushing those divisions and<br>exterminating them with his shafts, the form of Drona became like that of<br>the blazing Yuga-fire. That mighty car-warrior pierced cars, elephants,<br>and steeds, and foot-soldiers, in that battle, each with only a single<br>arrow, (and never employing more than one in any case). There then was no<br>warrior in the Pandava army who was capable of bearing, O lord, the<br>arrows shot from the bow of Drona. Scorched by the rays of the sun and<br>blasted by the shafts of Drona, the Pandava divisions there began to reel<br>about on the field. And thy host also, similarly slaughtered by<br>Prishata's son, seemed to blaze up at every point like a dry forest on<br>fire. And while both Drona and Dhrishtadyumna were slaughtering the two<br>hosts, the warriors of both armies, in utter disregard of their lives,<br>fought everywhere to the utmost extent of their prowess. Neither in thy<br>host, nor in that of the enemy, O bull of Bharata's race, was there a<br>single warrior who fled away from the battle through fear. Those uterine<br>brothers, viz., Vivingsati and Chitrasena and the mighty car-warrior<br>Vikarna, surrounded Kunti's son Bhimasena on all sides. And Vinda and<br>Anuvinda of Avanti, and Kshemadhurti of great prowess supported thy three<br>sons (who contended against Bhimasena). King Valhika of great energy and<br>noble parentage, with his own troops and counsellors, resisted the sons<br>of Draupadi. Saivya, the chief of the Govasanas, with a thousand foremost<br>warriors, faced the son, of great prowess, of the king of the Kasis and<br>resisted him. King Salya, the ruler of the Madras, surrounded royal<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, who resembled a blazing fire. The brave<br>and wrathful Duhsasana, properly supported by his own divisions, angrily<br>proceeded, in that battle, against Satyaki, that foremost of<br>car-warriors. I myself, with my own troops, cased in mail and equipped<br>with weapons, and supported by four hundred foremost of bowmen, resisted<br>Chekitana.[138] Sakuni with seven hundred Gandhara warriors armed with<br>bows, darts and swords, resisted the son of Madri (viz., Sahadeva). Vinda<br>and Anuvinda of Avanti, those two great bowmen, who had, for the sake of<br>their friend (Duryodhana), uplifted their weapons, disregarding their<br>lives, encountered Virata, the king of the Matsyas. King Valhika,<br>exerting himself vigorously, resisted the mighty and unvanquished<br>Sikhandin, the son of Yajnasena, that hero capable of resisting all foes.<br>The chief of Avanti, with the Sauviras and the cruel Prabhadrakas,<br>resisted wrathful Dhrishtadyumna, the prince of the Panchalas. Alamvusha<br>quickly rushed against the brave Rakshasa Ghatotkacha. of cruel deeds,<br>who was wrathfully advancing to battle. The mighty car-warrior<br>Kuntibhoja, accompanied by a large force, resisted Alamvusha, that prince<br>of Rakshasas, of fierce mien. Thus, O Bharata, hundreds of separate<br>encounters between the warriors of thy army and theirs, took place.<br><br>"As regards the ruler of the Sindhus, he remained in the rear of the<br>whole army protected by many foremost of bowmen and car-warriors<br>numbering Kripa amongst them. And the ruler of the Sindhus had for the<br>protectors of his wheels two of the foremost warriors, viz., the son of<br>Drona on his right, O king, and the Suta's son (Karna) on the left. And<br>for protecting his rear he had a number of warriors headed by Somadatta's<br>son, viz., Kripa, and Vrishasena, and Sala, and the invincible Salya, who<br>were conversant with policy and were mighty bowmen accomplished in<br>battle. And the Kuru warriors, having made these arrangements for the<br>protection of the ruler of the Sindhus, fought (with the Pandavas).'"
