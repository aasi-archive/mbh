                            'Sanjaya said, 'Karna, the son of Vikartana,[222] O king, resisted the<br>mighty car-warrior Sahadeva in that battle, who advanced from desire of<br>getting at Drona. Piercing the son of Radha with nine shafts, Sahadeva<br>once more pierced that warrior with nine straight arrows. Karna then<br>pierced Sahadeva in return with a hundred straight shafts, and displaying<br>great lightness in hand, cut off the latter's stringed bow. Then the<br>valiant son of Madri, taking up another bow, pierced Karna with twenty<br>arrows. This feat of his seemed exceedingly wonderful. Then Karna,<br>slaying Sahadeva's steeds with many straight shafts, speedily despatched<br>the latter's driver with a broad-headed shaft, to Yama's abode. This<br>carless Sahadeva then took up a sword and a shield. Even those weapons<br>were cut off by Karna smiling the while. Then the mighty Sahadeva, in<br>that encounter, sped towards the car of Vikartana's son, a heavy and<br>terrible mace decked with gold. Karna, then with his shafts, quickly cut<br>off that mace which hurled by Sahadeva, coursed towards him impetuously,<br>and caused it to fall down on the earth. Beholding his mace cut off,<br>Sahadeva quickly hurled a dart at Karna. That dart also was cut off by<br>Karna. The son of Madri, then, quickly jumping down from his excellent<br>car, and blazing with wrath upon beholding Karna stationed before him,<br>took up a car-wheel and hurled it at the son of Adhiratha. The Suta's<br>son, however, with many thousands of arrows, cut off that wheel coursing<br>towards him like the uplifted wheel of Death. When that wheel had been<br>cut off, Sahadeva, O sire, aiming at Karna, hurled at him the shafts of<br>his car, the traces of his steeds, the yokes of his cars, the limbs of<br>elephants and steeds and dead human bodies. Karna cut off all these with<br>his shafts. Seeing himself deprived of all weapons, Madri's son,<br>Sahadeva, struck by Karna with many shafts, left the battle. Pursuing him<br>for a while, the son of Radha, O bull of Bharata's race, smilingly<br>addressed Sahadeva and said these cruel words, 'Do not, O hero, fight in<br>battle with those that are superior to thee. Fight with thy equals, O son<br>of Madri! Do not mistrust my words.' Then touching him with the horn of<br>his bow, he once more said, 'Yonder, Arjuna is fighting resolutely with<br>the Kurus in battle. Go there, O son of Madri, or return home if thou<br>likest.' Having said those words, Karna, that foremost of car-warriors,<br>smilingly proceeded on his car against the troops of the king of the<br>Panchalas. The slayer of foes, that mighty car-warrior, devoted to truth,<br>slew not the son of Madri although he had got the opportunity,<br>recollecting the words of Kunti. Sahadeva, then, heartless and afflicted<br>with arrows, and pierced with the wordy darts of Karna, no longer<br>cherished any love for life. That mighty car-warrior then quickly<br>ascended the car of Janamejaya, the illustrious prince of the Panchalas.'"
