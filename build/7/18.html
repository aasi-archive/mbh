                            "Sanjaya said, 'The Samsaptakas,[32] then, filled with joy, took their<br>stand on a level field, having, with their cars, formed an array in the<br>shape of the half-moon. And those tigers among men, beholding the<br>diadem-decked (Arjuna) come towards them, were, O sire, filled with<br>delight and uttered loud shouts. That noise filled the sky and all the<br>points of the compass, cardinal and subsidiary. And because it was an<br>open plain covered only with men, it produced no echoes. Ascertaining<br>them to be exceedingly delighted, Dhananjaya, with a little smile, said<br>these words unto Krishna: 'Behold, O thou that hast Devaki for thy<br>mother, those Trigarta brothers, who are about to perish in battle, are<br>filled with delight at a time when they should weep. Or, this is, without<br>doubt, the hour of delight (with them) since they will obtain those<br>excellent regions that are unattainable by cowards.' Having said these<br>words unto the mighty-armed Hrishikesa, Arjuna came upon the arrayed<br>ranks of the Trigartas in battle, taking up then his conch called<br>Devadatta decked with gold, he blew it with great force, filling all the<br>points of the compass with its blare. Terrified by that blare, that<br>car-host of the Samsaptakas stood motionless in battle, as if it was<br>petrified. And all their animals stood with eyes wide open, ears and<br>necks and lips paralysed, and legs motionless. And they passed urine and<br>vomited blood. Regaining consciousness then, and placing their ranks in<br>proper order, they shot their arrows all at once at the son of Pandu.<br>Capable of displaying his prowess with great speed, Arjuna, with five and<br>ten arrows cut off those thousands of arrows before they could reach him.<br>They then pierced Arjuna, each with ten arrows. Partha pierced them with<br>three arrows. Then each of them, O king, pierced Partha with five arrows.<br>Endued with great prowess, he pierced each of them in return with two<br>arrows. And, once again, excited with wrath, they quickly poured upon<br>Arjuna and Kesava countless arrows like the clouds pouring upon a lake<br>their incessant showers. Then those thousands of arrows fell upon Arjuna,<br>like swarms of bees upon a flowering cluster of trees in the forest. Then<br>deeply pierced Arjuna's diadem with thirty shafts, endued with the<br>strength of adamant with those shafts equipped with wings of gold fixed<br>on his diadem, Arjuna, as if decked with ornaments of gold, shone like<br>the (newly) risen sun. The son of Pandu then, in that battle, with a<br>broad-headed arrow, cut off the leathern fence of Suvahu, and covered<br>Sudharman and Sudhanwan, and Suvahu pierced Partha with ten arrows.<br>Partha, having the excellent ape-device on his banner, pierced all of<br>them in return with many arrows, and also cut off, with some broad-headed<br>shafts, their standards made of gold. And cutting off the bow of<br>Sudhanwan, he slew with his arrows the latter's steeds. And then he cut<br>off from his trunk the latter's head graced with turban. Upon the fall of<br>that hero, his followers were terrified. And stricken with panic, they<br>all fled away to where Duryodhana's forces were. Then Vasava's son,<br>filled with wrath, smote that mighty host with incessant showers of<br>arrows, like the sun destroying darkness by means of his incessant rays.<br>Then when that host broke and melted away on all sides, and Arjuna was<br>filled with wrath, the Trigartas were struck with fear. While being<br>slaughtered by Partha with his straight shafts, they remained where they<br>stood, deprived of their senses, like a terrified, herd of deer. Then the<br>king of the Trigartas, filled with rage, addressed those mighty<br>car-warrior, saying, 'Do not fly, ye heroes! It behoveth ye not to be<br>frightened. Having, in the sight of all the troops, taken those terrible<br>steps, repairing thither, what shall ye say unto the leaders of<br>Duryodhana's host? Do we not incur ridicule in the world by such a<br>(cowardly) act in battle? Therefore, stop ye all, and fight according to<br>your strength.' Thus addressed, O king, those heroes, repeatedly uttering<br>loud shouts, blew their conchs, gladdening one another. Then those<br>Samsaptakas once more returned to the field, with the Narayana cow-herds,<br>resolved to fade Death himself.'"
