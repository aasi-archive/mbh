                            "Sanjaya said, 'Shooting clouds of arrows, all those warriors,<br>accomplished in smiting, carefully, O monarch, encountered Yuyudhana.<br>Drona struck him with seven and seventy shafts of great keenness. And<br>Durmarshana struck him with a dozen, Duhsasana, struck him with ten<br>shafts. And Vikarna also pierced him on the left side as also on the<br>centre of the chest with thirty keen shafts equipped with Kanka feathers.<br>And Durmukha struck him with ten shafts, and Duhsasana with eight,<br>Chitrasena, O sire, pierced him with a couple of shafts. And Duryodhana,<br>O king, and many other heroes, afflicted that mighty car-warrior with<br>dense showers of shafts in that battle. Though checked on all sides by<br>those mighty car-warriors, viz., thy sons, Yuyudhana of Vrishni's race<br>pierced each of them separately with his straight shafts. Indeed, he<br>pierced the son of Bharadwaja with three shafts, and Duhsasana with nine,<br>and Vikarna with five and twenty, and Chitrasena with seven, and<br>Durmarshana with a dozen, and Vivinsati with eight, and Satyavrata with<br>nine, and Vijaya with ten shafts. And having pierced Rukmangada also that<br>mighty car-warrior, viz., Satyaki, shaking his bow, speedily proceeded<br>against thy son (Duryodhana). And Yuyudhana, in the sight of all men,<br>deeply pierced with his arrows the king, that greatest of car-warriors in<br>the whole world. Then commenced a battle between those two. Both shooting<br>keen arrows and both aiming countless shafts, each of those mighty<br>car-warriors made the other invisible in that battle. And Satyaki,<br>pierced by the Kuru king, looked exceedingly resplendent as blood<br>copiously ran adown his body, like a sandal tree shedding its juicy<br>secretions. Thy son also pierced by Satwata with clouds of shafts, looked<br>beautiful like a stake set up (at a sacrifice) decked all over with gold.<br>Then Madhava, O king, in that battle, cut off with razor-faced arrow,<br>smiling the while, the bow of the Kuru king. And then he pierced the<br>bowless king with countless arrows. Pierced with arrows by that foe of<br>great activity, the king could not brook this indication of the enemy's<br>success. Duryodhana then, taking up another formidable bow, the back of<br>whose staff was decked with gold, speedily pierced Satyaki with a hundred<br>arrows. Deeply pierced by thy mighty son armed with the bow, Yuyudhana<br>became inflamed with wrath and began to afflict thy son. Beholding the<br>king thus afflicted, thy sons, those mighty car-warriors, shrouded<br>Satyaki with dense showers of arrows, shot with great force. Whilst being<br>thus shrouded by those mighty car-warriors, viz., thy multitude of sons,<br>Yuyudhana pierced each of them with five arrows, and once more with<br>seven. And soon he pierced Duryodhana with eight swift arrows and,<br>smiling the while, cut off the latter's bow that frightened all foes. And<br>with a few arrows he also felled the king's standard adorned with a<br>jewelled elephant. And slaying then the four steeds of Duryodhana with<br>four arrows, the illustrious Satyaki felled the king's charioteer with a<br>razor-faced shaft. Meanwhile, Yuyudhana, filled with joy, pierced the<br>mighty car-warrior, viz., the Kuru king, with many arrows capable of<br>penetrating into the very vitals. Then, O king, thy son Duryodhana, while<br>being thus struck in that battle with those excellent arrows of Sini's<br>grandson, suddenly fled away. And the king, quickly mounted the car of<br>Chitrasena, armed with the bow. Beholding the king thus attacked by<br>Satyaki in battle, and reduced to the position of Soma in the firmament<br>while seized by Rahu, cries of woe arose from every section of the Kuru<br>host. Hearing that uproar, the mighty car-warrior Kritavarman quickly<br>proceeded to that spot where the puissant Madhava. was battling. And<br>Kritavarman proceeded, shaking his bow, and urging his steeds, and urging<br>his charioteer with the words, 'Go with speed, Go with speed!' Beholding<br>Kritavarman rushing towards him like the Destroyer himself with wide-open<br>mouth, Yuyudhana, O king, addressed his driver, saying, 'That<br>Kritavarman, armed with arrows, is rushing in his car towards me with<br>speed. Then, with his steeds urged to their greatest speed, and on his<br>car duly equipped, Satyaki came upon the ruler of the Bhojas, the<br>foremost of all bowmen. Then those two tigers among men, both inflamed<br>with rage, and both resembling fire encountered each other like two<br>tigers endued with great activity. Kritavarman pierced Sini's grandson<br>with six and twenty whetted arrows of keen points, and the latter's<br>driver with five arrows. And skilled in battle, the son of Hridika<br>pierced, with four mighty shafts, the four excellent and well-broken<br>steeds of Satyaki that were of the Sindhu breed. Owning a standard decked<br>with gold, and adorned with golden mail, Kritavarman, shaking his<br>formidable bow, whose staff was decked with gold, thus checked, Yuyudhana<br>with shafts equipped with golden wings. Then the grandson of Sini,<br>desirous of seeing Dhananjaya, sped with great activity eight arrows at<br>Kritavarman. That scorcher of foes, then, deeply pierced by that mighty<br>foe,&#8212;that invincible warrior,&#8212;began to tremble like a hill during an<br>earthquake. After this, Satyaki, of prowess incapable of being baffled,<br>speedily pierced Kritavarman's four steeds with three and sixty keen<br>arrows, and his driver also with seven. Indeed, Satyaki, then aiming<br>another arrow of golden wings, that emitted blazing flames and resembled<br>an angry snake, or the rod of the Destroyer himself, pierced Kritavarman.<br>That terrible arrow, penetrating through his antagonist's effulgent<br>armour decked with gold, entered the earth, dyed with blood. Afflicted<br>with the shafts of Satwata, and bathed in blood in that battle,<br>Kritavarman throwing aside his bow with arrow, fell upon his car. That<br>lion-toothed hero of immeasurable prowess, that bull among men, afflicted<br>by Satyaki with his arrows, fell on his knees upon the terrace of his<br>car. Having thus resisted Kritavarman who resembled the thousand-armed<br>Arjuna of old, or Ocean himself of immeasurable might, Satyaki proceeded<br>onwards. Passing through Kritavarman's division bristling with swords and<br>darts and bows, and abounding in elephants and steeds and cars, and out<br>of the ground rendered awful in consequence of the blood shed by foremost<br>Kshatriyas numbering by hundreds, that bull among the Sinis proceeded<br>onwards in the very sight of all the troops, like the slayer of Vritra<br>through the Asura array. Meanwhile, the mighty son of Hridika, taking up<br>another huge bow, stayed where he was, resisting Pandavas in battle.'"
