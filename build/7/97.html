                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'After that shafts of Drona had been cut off and<br>Dhrishtadyumna thus rescued, O Sanjaya, by Yuyudhana, that foremost one<br>of the Vrishni race, what did that great bowman, that foremost of all<br>wielders of weapons, viz., Drona, do in battle unto that tiger among men,<br>viz., the grandson of Sini?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Then Drona, like a mighty snake, having wrath for his<br>poison, his stretched bow for his wide-open mouth, his sharp shafts for<br>his teeth and whetted arrows for his fangs, with eyes red as copper from<br>rage, and breathing hard, that mighty hero among men, perfectly fearless,<br>borne on his red steeds of great speed, that seemed to soar into the<br>skies or get at the top of a mountain, rushed towards Yuyudhana,<br>scattering his arrows equipped with golden wings. Then that subjugator of<br>hostile cities, that hero of Sini's race invincible in battle, beholding<br>that irresistible Drona cloud having showers of arrows for its watery<br>downpour, the rattle of car-wheels for its roar, the out-stretched bow<br>for its volume, long shafts for its lightning-flashes, darts and swords<br>for its thunder, wrath for the winds and urged on by those steeds that<br>constituted the hurricane (impelling it forwards), rushed towards him,<br>addressed his charioteer and smilingly said, O Suta, proceed quickly and<br>cheerfully, urging the steeds to their greatest speed, against that<br>heroic Brahmana, fallen off from the duties of his order, that refuge of<br>Dhritarashtra's son, that dispeller of the (Kuru) king's sorrows and<br>fear, that preceptor of all the princes, that warrior ever boastful of<br>his prowess.' Then the excellent steeds of silvery hue belonging to him<br>of Madhu's race, endued with the speed of the wind, quickly proceeded<br>towards Drona. Then those two chastisers of foes, viz., Drona and Sini's<br>grandson, fought with each other, each striking the other with thousands<br>of shafts. Those two bulls among men filled the welkin with their arrowy<br>showers. Indeed, the two heroes covered the ten points of the compass<br>with their shafts. And they poured on each other their shafts like two<br>clouds pouring their contents (on the earth) on the expiration of summer.<br>The sun became invisible. The very wind ceased to blow. And in<br>consequence of those showers of shafts filling the welkin, a continuous<br>and thick gloom was caused there that became unbearable to the other<br>heroes. And when the shafts of Drona and Sini's grandson had caused that<br>gloom there, none beheld any cessation in shooting in either of them.<br>They were both quick in the use of weapons, and they were both looked<br>upon as lions among men. The sound produced by those torrents of arrows,<br>shot by both striking against each other was heard to resemble the sound<br>of the thunder hurled by Sakra. The forms of heroic warriors pierced with<br>long shafts looked like those of snakes, O Bharata, hit by snakes of<br>virulent poison. Brave warriors incessantly heard the twangs of their<br>bows and the sounds of their palms to resemble the sound of thunder<br>falling upon summits of mountains. The cars of both of those warriors, O<br>king, their steeds, and their charioteers pierced with shafts of golden<br>wings, became beautiful to behold. Fierce was the downpour, O monarch, of<br>shafts that were bright and straight and that looked resplendent like<br>snakes of virulent poison freed from their sloughs. The umbrellas of both<br>were cut off, as also the standards of both. And both of them were<br>covered with blood, and both were inspired with the hope of victory. With<br>blood trickling down every limb of theirs, they resembled a couple of<br>elephants with secretions trickling down their bodies. And they continued<br>to strike each other with fatal shafts. The roars and shouts and other<br>cries of the soldiers, the blare of conchs and the beat of drums ceased,<br>O king, for none uttered any sound. Indeed, all the divisions became<br>silent, and all the warriors stopped fighting. People, filled with<br>curiosity became spectators of that single combat. Car-warriors and<br>elephant riders and horsemen and foot-soldiers, surrounding those two<br>bulls among men, witnessed their encounter with steadfast eyes. And the<br>elephant-divisions stood still and so also the horse-divisions, and so<br>also the car-divisions. All stood still, disposed in array. Variegated<br>with pearls and corals, decked with gems and gold, adorned with standards<br>and ornaments, with coats of mail made of gold, with triumphal banners<br>with rich caparisons of elephants, with fine blankets, with bright and<br>sharp weapons, with yak-tails, ornamented with gold and silver, on the<br>heads of steeds, with garlands, round the frontal globes of elephants and<br>rings round their tusks, O Bharata, the Kuru and the Pandava hosts then<br>looked like a mass of clouds at the close of summer, decked with rows of<br>cranes and myriads of fire-flies (under them) and adorned with rainbows<br>and flashes of lightning. Both our men and those of Yudhishthira, beheld<br>that battle between Yuyudhana and high-souled Drona; the gods also,<br>headed by Brahma and Soma, and the Siddhas, and the Charanas, and the<br>Vidyadharas, and the great Snakes, saw it, stationed on their foremost of<br>sky-ranging cars. And beholding the diverse motion, forward and backward,<br>of those lions among men, and their acts of striking each other, the<br>spectators were filled with wonder. And both endued with great strength,<br>Drona and Satyaki, displaying their lightness of hand in the use of<br>weapons, began to pierce each other with shafts. Then he of Dasarha's<br>race, with his mighty shafts, cut off those of the illustrious Drona in<br>that battle, and then, within a moment, the latter's bow also. Within,<br>however, the twinkling of an eye, the son of Bharadwaja took up another<br>bow and strung it. Even that bow of his was cut off by Satyaki. Drona<br>then, with utmost quickness waited with another bow in hand. As often,<br>however, as Drona strung his bow, Satyaki cut it off. And this he did<br>full nine and seven times. Beholding then that superhuman feat of<br>Yuyudhana in battle, Drona, O monarch, thought in his mind, 'This force<br>of weapons that I see in this foremost one among the Satwatas exists in<br>Rama and Dhananjaya and was seen also in Kartavirya and that tiger among<br>men, viz., Bhishma. The son of Bharadwaja, therefore, mentally applauded<br>the prowess of Satyaki. Beholding that lightness of hand equal unto that<br>of Vasava himself, that foremost of regenerate ones, that first of all<br>persons conversant with weapons, was highly gratified with Madhava. And<br>the gods also, with Vasava at their head, were gratified with it. The<br>gods and the Gandharvas, O monarch, had never before witnessed that<br>lightness of hand of the quickly moving Yuyudhana, although they and the<br>Siddhas and the Charanas had been acquainted with the feats of which<br>Drona was capable. Then Drona, that foremost of persons acquainted with<br>weapons, that grinder of Kshatriyas, taking up another bow, aimed some<br>weapons. Satyaki, however, baffling those weapons with the illusion of<br>his own weapon struck him with some sharp shafts. All this seemed highly<br>wonderful. Beholding that superhuman feat of his in battle, that feat of<br>which nobody else was capable, and which displayed very great skill,<br>those amongst thy warriors that were judges of skill, applauded it.<br>Satyaki shot the same weapons that Drona shot. Beholding this, that<br>scorcher of foes, viz., the preceptor, fought with a little less<br>boldness, than usual. Then that master of military science, O king,<br>filled with wrath, invoked celestial weapons for the destruction of<br>Yuyudhana. Beholding that terrible foe-slaughtering Agneya weapon,<br>Satyaki, that mighty bowman, invoked another celestial weapon, viz., the<br>Varuna. Seeing them both take up celestial weapons, loud cries of Oh and<br>Alas arose there. The very creatures having the sky for their element<br>ceased to range through it. Then the Varuna and the Agneya weapons which<br>had thus been grafted on their shafts coming against each other became<br>fruitless.[140] Just at that time, the sun passed down in his course.<br>Then king Yudhishthira and Bhimasena, the son of Pandu, and Nakula, and<br>Sahadeva, desirous of protecting Satyaki, and the Matsyas, and the<br>Salweya troops, speedily proceeded towards Drona. Then thousands of<br>princes placing Duhsasana at their head, hastily proceeded towards Drona<br>(for protecting him) who was surrounded by foes. Then, O king, commenced<br>a fierce battle between them and thy bowmen. The earth was covered with<br>dust and with showers of arrows shot (by both sides). And everything<br>being thus covered, nothing could any longer be discerned. Indeed, when<br>the troops were thus overwhelmed with dust, the battle proceeded in utter<br>disregard (of persons and rules).'"
