                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'I see, O sire, that this act of Karna and<br>Duryodhana and Suvala's son, Sakuni, and of thyself, in especial, hath<br>been very much against the dictates of policy. Indeed, when you knew that<br>dart could always slay one person in battle, and that it was incapable of<br>being either borne or baffled by the very gods with Vasava at their head,<br>why then, O Sanjaya, was it not hurled by Karna at Devaki's son, or<br>Phalguna, while he was engaged with this in battle before?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Returning from battle every day, O monarch, all of us, O<br>foremost one of Kuru's race, used to debate in the night and say unto<br>Karna. Tomorrow morning, O Karna, this dart should be hurled at either<br>Kesava or Arjuna.' When, however, the morning came, O king, through<br>destiny, both Karna and the other warriors forgot that resolution. I<br>think destiny to be supreme, since Karna, with that dart in his hands,<br>did not slay in battle either Partha or Devaki's son, Krishna. Indeed,<br>because his understanding was afflicted by destiny itself, it is for this<br>that he did not, stupefied by the illusion of the gods, hurl that fatal<br>dart of Vasava, though he had it in his hand, at Devaki's son, Krishna<br>for his destruction or at Partha endued with prowess like Indra's, O<br>lord!'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Ye are destroyed by destiny, by your own<br>understanding, and by Kesava. Vasava's dart is lost, having effected the<br>slaughter of Ghatotkacha who was as insignificant as straw. Karna, and my<br>sons, as all the other kings, through his highly impolitic act, have<br>already entered the abode of Yama. Tell me now how the battle once more<br>raged between the Kurus and the Pandavas after the fall of Hidimva's son.<br>How did they that rushed against Drona, arrayed in order of battle and<br>well-skilled in smiting, viz., the Srinjaya and the Panchalas, fight?<br>How, indeed, did the Pandus and Srinjaya withstand the smiting Drona,<br>when the latter proceeding against them, penetrated into their host,<br>excited with wrath at the slaughter of Bhurisravas and Jayadratha,<br>reckless of his very life, and resembling a yawning tiger or the<br>Destroyer himself with wide open mouth? What also did they do in battle,<br>O sire, viz., Drona's son and Karna and Kripa and others headed by<br>Duryodhana that protected the preceptor? Tell me, O Sanjaya, how my<br>warriors in that battle covered with their shafts Dhananjaya and<br>Vrikodara who were solicitous of slaying Bharadwaja's son. How, indeed,<br>did these excited with wrath at the death of the ruler of the Sindhus,<br>and those at the death of Ghatotkacha, each side unable to brook their<br>loss, fight that nocturnal battle?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Upon the slaughter, that night, O king, of the Rakshasa,<br>Ghatotkacha, by Karna, thy troops, filled with joy, uttered loud shouts.<br>In that dark hour of the night, they fell impetuously upon the Pandava<br>troops and began to slay them. Seeing all this, king Yudhishthira became<br>exceedingly cheerless, O chastiser of foes. The mighty-armed son of<br>Pandu, then addressed Bhimasena and said, 'O thou of mighty arms, resist<br>Dhritarashtra host. In consequence of the slaughter of Hidimva's son, a<br>great stupefaction overwhelms me.' Having ordered Bhimasena thus, he sat<br>down on his car. With tearful face and sighing repeatedly, the king<br>became exceedingly cheerless at the sight of Karna's prowess. Beholding<br>him so afflicted, Krishna said these words, 'O son of Kunti, let not such<br>grief be thine. Such cheerlessness does not become thee, O chief of the<br>Bharatas, as it does an ordinary person. Rise, O king, and fight. Bear<br>the heavy burden, O lord! If cheerlessness overtakes thee, our victory<br>becomes uncertain.' Hearing these words of Krishna, Dharma's son,<br>Yudhishthira, wiping his eyes with his hands, replied unto Krishna,<br>saying, 'O thou of mighty arms, the excellent path of duty is not unknown<br>to me. The dire consequences of a Brahmana's slaughter are his that<br>forgets the services he receives at other's hands. Whilst we were living<br>in the woods the high-souled son of Hidimva, although then a mere child<br>did us many services, O Janardana! Learning that Partha, having white<br>steeds, had departed for the acquisition of weapons, that great bowman<br>(viz., Ghatotkacha), O Krishna, came to me at Kamyaka. He dwelt with us<br>till Dhananjaya's reappearance. Whilst proceeding over many inaccessible<br>fastnesses, he himself carried on his back the tired princess of<br>Panchala. The feats he achieved, O lord, show that he was skilled in all<br>modes of warfare. Indeed, that high-souled one accomplished many<br>difficult feats for my benefit. My affection for Ghatotkacha, that prince<br>of the Rakshasas is twice that, O Janardana, which I naturally bear<br>towards Sahadeva. That mighty-armed one was devoted to me. I was dear to<br>him and he was dear to me. It is for this that, scorched by grief, O thou<br>of Vrishni's race, I have become so cheerless. Behold, O thou of<br>Vrishni's race, our troops afflicted and routed by the Kauravas. Behold,<br>those mighty car-warriors, viz., Drona and Karna, are contending<br>earnestly in battle. Behold, the Pandava host crushed at dead of night,<br>like an extensive forest of heath by a couple of infuriated elephants.<br>Disregarding the might of Bhimasena's son, as also the variety of weapon<br>that Partha bears, the Kauravas are putting forth their prowess, Yonder,<br>Drona and Karna and king Suyodhana, having slain the Rakshasa in battle,<br>are uttering loud roars. How, O Janardana, when we are alive and thyself<br>too, could Hidimva's son be slain while engaged with the Suta's son?<br>Having caused a great slaughter amongst us, and in the very sight of<br>Savyasachin, Karna, O Krishna, hath slain Bhimasena's son of great<br>strength, the Rakshasa, Ghatotkacha. When Abhimanyu was slain by the<br>wicked Dhartarashtras, the mighty car-warrior Savyasachin, O Krishna, was<br>not present in that battle. We also were all held in check by the<br>illustrious ruler of the Sindhus. Drona, with his son (Aswatthaman),<br>became the cause of that act. The preceptor himself told Karna the means<br>of Abhimanyu's slaughter. While Abhimanyu was battling with the sword it<br>was the preceptor himself that cut off that weapon. And while fallen into<br>such distress, Kritavarman most cruelly slew the steeds and the two<br>Parshni drivers (of the boy). Other great bowmen then despatched the son<br>of Subhadra. For a little offence, O Krishna, was the ruler of the<br>Sindhus slain by the wielder of Gandiva. O foremost one among the<br>Yadavas, that act did not give me great joy. If the slaughter of foes is<br>just and should be achieved by the Pandavas, then Drona and Karna should<br>have been slain before this. This is what I think. O bull among men,<br>those two are the root of our woes. Obtaining those two (as his allies)<br>in battle, Suyodhana has become confident. Indeed, when it was Drona that<br>should have been slain or the Suta's son with his followers, the<br>mighty-armed Dhananjaya slew the Sindhu king whose connection with the<br>affair was very remote. The punishment of the Suta's son should certainly<br>by undertaken by me. I shall, therefore, O hero, now fight for slaying<br>the Suta's son. The mighty-armed Bhimasena is now engaged with Drona's<br>division.' Having said these words, Yudhishthira quickly proceeded<br>against Karna, holding his formidable bow and blowing his conch fiercely.<br>Then, surrounded by a Panchala and Prabhadraka force of a thousand cars,<br>three hundred elephants and five thousand horses,<br><br>Sikhandin speedily followed in the wake of the king. Then the mail-clad<br>Panchalas and the Pandavas headed by Yudhishthira beat their drums and<br>blew their conchs. At this time Vasudeva of mighty arms, addressing<br>Dhananjaya said, 'Filled with wrath, yonder proceedeth Yudhishthira with<br>great speed from desire of slaying the Suta's son. It is not proper that<br>thou shouldst rely upon him in this.' Having said these words, Hrishikesa<br>quickly urged the steeds. Indeed, Janardana followed in the wake of the<br>king who was now at a distance. At that time, seeing Dharma's son,<br>Yudhishthira, whose mind was afflicted by grief and who seemed to be<br>scorched as if by fire, rush with speed from desire of slaying the Suta's<br>son, Vyasa approached him and said these words.'[240]<br><br>"Vyasa said, By good luck, Phalguna liveth still although he had<br>encountered Karna in battle. Indeed, Karna had kept his dart, desirous of<br>slaying Savyasachin, O bull of Bharata's race, by good luck Jishnu did<br>not engage in single combat with Karna. Each of them in that case<br>challenging the other, would have shot his celestial weapons on all<br>sides. The weapons of the Suta's son would have been destroyed by Arjuna.<br>The former then afflicted by the latter, would certainly have hurled<br>Indra's dart in that battle. O Yudhishthira! O foremost one of Bharata's<br>race, (if this had come to pass), then great would have been thy grief. O<br>giver of honours, by good luck the Rakshasa hath been slain in battle by<br>the Suta's son. Indeed, Ghatotkacha hath been slain by death himself<br>making the dart of Vasava an instrument only. For thy good it is, O sire,<br>that the Rakshasa hath been slain in battle. Do not yield to anger, O<br>foremost one of Bharata's race, and do not set thy heart on grief. O<br>Yudhishthira, this is the end of all creatures in this world. Uniting<br>with thy brothers and all the illustrious kings (of the host), fight with<br>the Kauravas in battle, O Bharata! On the fifth day from this, the earth<br>will be thine. O tiger among men, always think of virtue. With a cheerful<br>heart, O son of Pandu, practise kindness (to all creatures), penances,<br>charity, forgiveness, and truth. Victory is there where righteousness is.<br>Having said these words unto the son of Pandu, Vyasa made himself<br>invisible there and then.'"[241]
