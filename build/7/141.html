                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding Satwata, invincible in battle coming (towards<br>Arjuna), Bhurisravas, in rage, O king, suddenly advanced towards him. He<br>of Kuru's race, then, O king, addressing that bull of Sini's race, said,<br>'By luck it, is thou that hast today come within the range of my vision.<br>Today in this; battle, I obtain the wish I had always cherished. If thou<br>dost not flee away from battle, thou wilt not escape me with life.<br>Slaying thee today in fight, thou that art ever proud of thy heroism, I<br>will, O thou of Dasarha's race, gladden the Kuru king Suyodhana. Those<br>heroes, viz., Kesava and Arjuna, will today together behold thee lying on<br>the field of battle, scorched with my arrows. Hearing that thou hast been<br>slain by me, the royal son of Dharma, who caused thee to penetrate into<br>this host, will today be covered with shame. Pritha's son, Dhananjaya,<br>will today behold my prowess when he sees thee slain and lying on the<br>earth, covered with gore. This encounter with thee hath always been<br>desired by me, like the encounter of Sakra with Vali in the battle<br>between the gods and the Asuras in days of old. Today I will give thee<br>dreadful battle, O Satwata! Thou shalt thence truly understand (the<br>measure of) my energy, might, and manliness. Slain by me in battle, thou<br>shalt today proceed to the abode of Yama, like Ravana's son (Indrajit)<br>slain by Lakshmana, the younger brother of Rama. Today, Krishna and<br>Partha and king Yudhishthira the Just, O thou of Madhu's race, witnessing<br>thy slaughter will, without doubt, be overcome with despondency and will<br>give up battle. Causing thy death today, O Madhava, with keen shafts, I<br>will gladden the wives of all those that have been slain by thee in<br>battle. Having come within the scope of my vision, thou shalt not escape,<br>like a small deer from within the range of a lion's vision.' Hearing<br>these words of his, Yuyudhana, O king, answered him with a laugh, saying,<br>'O thou of Kuru's race, I am never inspired with fear in battle. Thou<br>shalt not succeed in terrifying me with thy words only. He will slay me<br>in battle who will succeed in disarming me. He that will slay me in<br>battle will slay (foes) for all time to come.[167] What is the use of<br>such idle and long-winded boast in words? Accomplish in deed what thou<br>sayest. Thy words seem to be as fruitless as the roar of autumnal clouds.<br>Hearing, O hero, these roars of thine, I cannot restrain my laughter. Let<br>that encounter, O thou of Kuru's race, which has been desired by thee so<br>long, take place today. My heart, O sire, inspired as it is with the<br>desire of an encounter with thee, cannot brook any delay. Before slaying<br>thee, I shall not abstain from the fight, O wretch.' Rebuking each other<br>in such words, those two bulls among men, both excited with great wrath,<br>struck each other in battle, each being desirous of taking the other's<br>life. Those great bowmen both endued with great might, encountered each<br>other in battle, each challenging the other, like two wrathful elephants<br>in rut for the sake of a she-elephant in her season. And those two<br>chastisers of foes, viz., Bhurisravas and Satyaki, poured upon each other<br>dense showers of arrows like two masses of clouds. Then Somadatta's son,<br>having shrouded the grandson of Sini with swift coursing shafts, once<br>more pierced the latter, O chief of the Bharatas, with many keen shafts,<br>from desire of slaying him. Having pierced Satyaki with ten shafts,<br>Somadatta's son sped many other keen shafts at that bull amongst the<br>Sinis, from a desire of compassing his destruction. Satyaki, however, O<br>lord, cut off, with the power of his weapons, all those keen shafts of<br>Bhurisravas, O king, in the welkin, before, in fact, any of them could<br>reach him. Those two heroes, those two warriors that enhanced the fame of<br>the Kurus and the Vrishnis respectively, both of noble lineage, thus<br>poured upon each other their arrowy showers. Like two tigers fighting<br>with their claws or two huge elephants with their tusks they mangled each<br>other with shafts and darts, such as car-warriors may use. Mangling each<br>other's limbs, and with blood issuing out of their wounds, those two<br>warriors engaged in a gambling match in which their lives were at the<br>stake, checked and confounded each other. Those heroes of excellent<br>feats, those enhancers of the fame of the Kurus and the Vrishnis, thus<br>fought with each other, like two leaders of elephantine herds. Indeed,<br>those warriors, both coveting the highest region, both cherishing the<br>desire of very soon attaining the region of Brahman, thus roared at each<br>other. Indeed, Satyaki and Somadatta's son continued to cover each other<br>with their arrowy showers in the sight of the Dhartarashtras filled with<br>joy. And the people there witnessed that encounter between those two<br>foremost of warriors who were fighting like two leaders of elephantine<br>herds for the sake of a she-elephant in her season. Then each slaying the<br>other's steeds and cutting off the other's bow, those car-less combatants<br>encountered each other with swords in a dreadful fight. Taking up two<br>beautiful and large and bright shields made of bull's hide, and two naked<br>swords, they careered on the field. Stalking in circles and in diverse<br>other kinds of courses duly, those grinders of foes excited with rage,<br>frequently struck each other. Armed with swords, clad in bright armour,<br>decked with cuirass and Angadas, those two famous warriors showed diverse<br>kinds of motion. They wheeled about on high and made side-thrusts, and<br>ran about, and rushed forward and rushed upwards. And those chastisers of<br>foes began to strike each other with their swords. And each of them<br>looked eagerly for the dereliction of the other. And both of those heroes<br>leapt beautifully and both showed their skill in that battle, began also<br>to make skilful passes at each other, and having struck each other, O<br>king, those heroes took rest for a moment in the sight of all the troops.<br>Having with their swords cut in pieces each other's beautiful shield, O<br>king, decked with a hundred moons, those tigers among men, engaged<br>themselves in a wrestling encounter. Both having broad chests, both<br>having long arms, both well-skilled in wrestling, they encountered each<br>other with their arms of iron that resembled spiked maces. And they<br>struck each other with their arms, and seized each other's arms, and each<br>seized with his arms the other's neck. And the skill they had acquired by<br>exercise, contributed to the joy of all the warriors that stood as<br>spectators of the encounter. And as those heroes fought with each other,<br>O king, in that battle, loud and terrible were the sounds produced by<br>them, resembling the fall of the thunder upon the mountain breast. Like<br>two elephants encountering each other with the end of their tusks, or<br>like two bulls with their horns, those two illustrious and foremost<br>warriors of the Kuru and the Satwata races, fought with each other,<br>sometimes binding each other with their arms, sometimes striking each<br>other with their heads, sometimes intertwining each other's legs,<br>sometimes slapping their armpits, sometimes pinching each other with<br>their nails, sometimes clasping each other tightly, sometimes twining<br>their legs round each other's loins, sometimes rolling on the ground,<br>sometimes advancing, sometimes receding, sometimes rising up, and<br>sometimes leaping up. Indeed, those two and thirty kinds of separate<br>manoeuvres that characterise encounters of that kind.<br><br>"When Satwata's weapons were exhausted during his engagement with<br>Bhurisravas, Vasudeva said unto Arjuna, 'Behold that foremost of all<br>bowmen, viz., Satyaki, engaged in battle, deprived of car. He hath<br>entered the Bharata host, having pierced through it, following in thy<br>wake, O son of Pandu! He hath fought with all the Bharata warriors of<br>great energy. The giver of large sacrificial presents, viz., Bhurisravas,<br>hath encountered that foremost of warriors while tired with fatigue.<br>Desirous of battle, Bhurisravas is about to encounter. Then that warrior<br>invincible in battle, viz., Bhurisravas, excited with wrath, vigorously<br>struck Satyaki, O king, like an infuriated elephant striking an<br>infuriated compeer. Those two foremost of warriors, both upon their cars,<br>and both excited with wrath, fought on, king, Kesava, and Arjuna<br>witnessing their encounter. Then the mighty-armed Krishna, addressing<br>Arjuna, said, 'Behold, that tiger among the Vrishnis and the Andhakas has<br>succumbed to Somadatta's son. Having achieved the most difficult feats,<br>exhausted with exertion, he hath been deprived of his car. O Arjuna,<br>protect Satyaki, thy heroic disciple. See that foremost of men may not,<br>for thy sake, O tiger among men, succumb to Bhurisravas, devoted to<br>sacrifices. O puissant one, speedily do what is needed.' Dhananjaya, with<br>a cheerful heart addressing Vasudeva, said, 'Behold, that bull amongst<br>the Rurus and that foremost one among the Vrishnis are sporting with each<br>other, like a huge elephant mad with rage sporting with a mighty lion in<br>the forest. While Dhananjaya the son of Pandu was thus speaking, loud<br>cries of oh and alas arose among the troops, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>since the mighty-armed Bhurisravas, exerting vigorously struck Satyaki<br>and brought him down upon the ground. And like a lion dragging an<br>elephant, that foremost one of Kuru's race, viz., Bhurisravas, that giver<br>of profuse presents at sacrifices, dragging that foremost one amongst the<br>Satwatas, looked resplendent in that battle. Then Bhurisravas in that<br>encounter, drawing his sword from the scabbard, seized Satyaki by the<br>hair of his head and struck him at the chest with his feet. Bhurisravas<br>then was about to cut off from Satyaki's trunk his head decked with<br>ear-rings. For sometime, the Satwata hero rapidly whirled his head with<br>the arm of Bhurisravas that held it by the hair, like a potter's wheel<br>whirled round with the staff. Beholding Satwata thus dragged in battle by<br>Bhurisravas. Vasudeva once more, O king, addressed Arjuna and said,<br>'Behold, that tiger among the Vrishnis and the Andhakas, that disciple of<br>thine, O mighty-armed one, not inferior to thee in bowmanship, hath<br>succumbed to Somadatta's son. O Partha, since Bhurisravas is thus<br>prevailing over the Vrishni hero, Satyaki, of prowess incapable of being<br>baffled, the very name of the latter is about to be falsified.[168] Thus<br>addressed by Vasudeva the mighty-armed son of Pandu, mentally worshipped<br>Bhurisravas in that battle, saying, 'I am glad that, Bhurisravas, that<br>enhancer of the fame of the Kurus, is dragging Satyaki in battle, as if<br>in sport. Without slaying Satyaki that foremost one among the heroes of<br>the Vrishni race, the Kuru warrior is only dragging him like a mighty<br>lion in the forest dragging a huge elephant.' Mentally applauding the<br>Kuru warrior thus, O king, the mighty-armed Arjuna, the son of Pritha,<br>replied unto Vasudeva, saying, 'My eyes having rested upon of the<br>Sindhus, I could not, O Madhava, see Satyaki. I shall, however, for the<br>sake of that Yadava warrior, achieve a most difficult feat.' Having said<br>these words, in obedience to Vasudeva, the son of Pandu, fixed on Gandiva<br>a sharp razor-headed arrow. That arrow, shot by Partha's hand and<br>resembling a meteor flashing down from the firmament, cut off the Kuru<br>warrior's arm with the sword in the grasp and decked with Angada.'"
