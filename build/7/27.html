                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Filled with rage, what did Partha, the son of<br>Pandu, do to Bhagadatta? What also did the king of the Pragjyotishas do<br>to Partha? Tell me all this, O Sanjaya!'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'While Partha and Krishna were thus engaged with the ruler<br>of the Pragjyotishas, all creatures regarded them to be very near the<br>jaws of Death. Indeed, O monarch, from the neck of his elephant,<br>Bhagadatta scattered showers of shafts on the two Krishnas, staying upon<br>their car. He pierced Devaki's son with many arrows made wholly of black<br>iron, equipped with wings of gold, whetted on stone, and shot from his<br>bow, drawn to the fullest stretch. Those shafts whose touch resembled<br>that of fire, equipped with beautiful feathers, and shot by Bhagadatta,<br>passing through Devaki's son, entered the earth. Partha then cut off<br>Bhagadatta's bow and slaying next the warrior that protected his elephant<br>from the flank, began to fight with him as if in sport. Then Bhagadatta<br>hurled at him fourteen lances of sharp points, that were bright as the<br>rays of the sun. Arjuna, however, cut each of those lances into three<br>fragments. Then Indra's son cut open the armour in which that elephant<br>was eased, by means of a thick shower of arrows. The armour thus cut off,<br>fell down on the earth. Exceedingly afflicted with arrows shot by Arjuna,<br>that elephant, deprived of its coat of mail, looked like a prince of<br>mountains destitute of its cloudy robes and with streaks of water running<br>down its breast. Then the ruler of the Pragjyotishas hurled at Vasudeva a<br>dart made wholly of iron and decked with gold. That dart Arjuna cut in<br>twain. Then cutting off the king's standard and umbrella by means of his<br>arrows Arjuna quickly pierced that ruler of the mountainous realms with<br>ten arrows, smiling all the while. Deeply pierced with those shafts of<br>Arjuna, that were beautifully winged with Kanka feathers, Bhagadatta, O<br>monarch, became incensed with the son of Pandu. He then hurled some<br>lances at Arjuna's head and uttered a loud shout. In consequence of those<br>lances Arjuna's diadem was displaced. Arjuna, then, having placed his<br>diadem properly, addressed the ruler of the Pragjyotishas, saying, 'Look<br>well on this world!' Thus addressed by him, Bhagadatta became filled with<br>rage, and taking up a bright bow showered upon both the Pandava and<br>Govinda his arrowy down-pours. Partha then cutting off his bow and<br>quivers, quickly struck him with two and seventy shafts, afflicting his<br>vital limbs. Thus pierced, he was excessively pained. Filled then with<br>rage, he with Mantras, turned his hook into the Vaishnava weapon and<br>hurled it at Arjuna's breast. That all-slaying weapon, hurled by<br>Bhagadatta, Kesava, covering Arjuna, received on his breast. Thereupon,<br>that weapon became a triumphal garland on Kesava's breast. Arjuna then<br>cheerlessly addressed Kesava, saying, 'O sinless one, without battling<br>thyself, thou art to only guide my steed! Thou hadst said so, O<br>lotus-eyed one! Why then dost thou not adhere to thy promise? If I sink<br>in distress, or become unable to baffle, or resist a foe or weapon, then<br>mayst thou act so, but not when I am standing thus. Thou knowest that<br>with my bow and arrows I am competent to vanquish these worlds with the<br>gods, the Asuras, and men.' Hearing these words of Arjuna, Vasudeva<br>replied unto him, saying, 'Listen, O Partha, to this secret and ancient<br>history as it is, O sinless one! I have four forms, eternally engaged as<br>I am in protecting the worlds. Dividing my own Self, I ordain the good of<br>the worlds. One form of mine, staying on the earth, is engaged in the<br>practice of ascetic austerities. Another beholdeth the good and the evil<br>deeds in the world. My third form, coming into the world of men, is<br>engaged in action. My fourth form lieth down in sleep for a thousand<br>years. The form of mine which awaketh from sleep at the end of a thousand<br>years, granteth, upon awakening, excellent boons to persons deserving of<br>them. The earth, knowing (on one occasion) that that time had come, asked<br>of me a boon for (her son) Naraka. Hear, O Partha, what that boon was.<br>Possessed of the Vaishnava weapon, let my son become incapable of being<br>slain by the gods and the Asuras. It behoveth thee to grant me that<br>weapon. Hearing this prayer, I then gave, in days of old, the supreme and<br>infallible Vaishnava weapon to the Earth's son. I said also at that time<br>these words, 'O Earth, let this weapon be infallible for the protection<br>of Naraka. None will be able to slay him. Protected by this weapon, thy<br>son will always, in all the worlds, be invincible and crush all hostile<br>hosts.' Saying, So be it! the intelligent goddess went away, her wishes<br>fulfilled. And Naraka also became invincible and always scorched his<br>foes. It was from Naraka, O Partha, that the ruler of the Pragjyotishas<br>got this weapon of mine. There is none, in all the world, O sire,<br>including even Indra and Rudra, who is unslayable by this weapon. It was<br>for thy sake, therefore, that I baffled it, violating my promise. The<br>great Asura hath now been divested of that supreme weapon. Slay now, O<br>Partha, that invincible foe of thine, viz., Bhagadatta, enemy of the<br>gods, even as I formerly slew for the good of the worlds, the Asura<br>Naraka.' Thus addressed by the high-souled Kesava, Partha suddenly<br>overwhelmed Bhagadatta with clouds of whetted arrows. Then, the<br>mighty-armed and high-souled Arjuna fearlessly struck a long arrow<br>between the frontal globes of his enemy's elephant. That arrow, splitting<br>the elephant like the thunder splitting a mountain, penetrated into its<br>body to the very wings, like a snake penetrating into an ant-hill. Though<br>urged repeatedly then by Bhagadatta, the elephant refused to obey like a<br>poor man's wife her lord. With limbs paralysed, it fell down, striking<br>the earth with its tusks. Uttering a cry of distress, that huge elephant<br>gave up the ghost. The son of Pandu then, with a straight shaft furnished<br>with a crescent-shaped head, pierced the bosom of king Bhagadatta. His<br>breast, being pierced through by the diadem-decked (Arjuna), king<br>Bhagadatta, deprived of life, threw down his bow and arrows. Loosened<br>from his head, the valuable piece of cloth that had served him for a<br>turban, fell down, like a petal from a lotus when its stalk is violently<br>struck. And he himself, decked with golden garlands, fell down from his<br>huge elephant adorned with golden housings, like flowering Kinsuka broken<br>by the force of the wind from the mountain-top. The son of Indra then,<br>having slain in battle that monarch who resembled Indra himself in<br>prowess and who was Indra's friend, broke the other warriors of thy army<br>inspired with hope of victory like the mighty wind breaking rows of<br>trees.'"
