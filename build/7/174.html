                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the mighty-armed Ghatotkacha, O king,<br>proceeding towards the car of Suta's son, Karna for slaughtering him in<br>battle, thy son Duryodhana addressing Duhsasana, said these words, 'The<br>Rakshasa, seeing the prowess of Karna in battle, is speedily advancing<br>against him. Resist that mighty car-warrior. Surrounded by a mighty force<br>proceed to that spot where the mighty Karna, the son of Vikartana, is<br>contending with the Rakshasa in battle. O giver of honours, surrounded by<br>troops and exerting thyself vigorously, protect Karna in battle. Let not<br>the terrible Rakshasa slay Karna in consequence of our carelessness.<br>Meanwhile, O king, Jatasura's mighty son, that foremost of smiters,<br>approaching Duryodhana, said unto him, 'O Duryodhana, commanded by thee,<br>I desire to slay, with their followers, thy foes of celebrity, viz., the<br>Pandavas, those warriors incapable of being easily defeated in battle. My<br>father was mighty Jatasura, that foremost of Rakshasa. Formerly, having<br>performed some Rakshasa slaying incantations, the despicable sons of<br>Pritha slew him. I desire to worship my dead sire by offering him the<br>blood of his foes, and their flesh, O monarch! it behoveth thee to grant<br>me permission.' The king, thus addressed, became exceedingly delighted<br>and said unto him repeatedly, 'Aided by Drona and Karna and others, I am<br>quite competent to vanquish my foes. Commanded, however, by me, O<br>Rakshasa, go thou to battle and slay Ghatotkacha in the fight&#8212;that<br>Rakshasa of fierce deeds, born of man, ever devoted to the welfare of the<br>Pandavas, and always slaying our elephants and steeds and car-warriors in<br>battle, himself all the while staying in the welkin, O, despatch him to<br>Yama's abode.' Saying, 'so be it,' and summoning Ghatotkacha to the<br>fight, Jatasura's son shrouded the son of Bhimasena with diverse kinds of<br>weapons. The son of Hidimva, however, alone and unsupported began, to<br>grind Alamvusha and Karna and the vast Kuru host, like the tempest<br>crushing a mass of clouds. Seeing then the power of (Ghatotkacha's)<br>illusion, the Rakshasa Alamvusha covered Ghatotkacha with showers of<br>diverse kinds of arrows. Having pierced Bhimasena's son with many shafts,<br>Alamvusha, without losing any time, began to afflict the Pandava host<br>with his arrows. Thus afflicted by him, O Bharata, the Pandava troops, at<br>dead of night, broke and fled away like clouds dispersed by a tempest.<br>Similarly, thy host also, mingled with the shafts of Ghatotkacha, fled<br>away at dead of night, O king, in thousands, throwing down their torches.<br>Alamvusha then, excited with great wrath, struck Bhimasena's son in that<br>dreadful battle with many shafts, like a driver striking an elephant.<br>Then Ghatotkacha cut off into minute fragments the car, the driver, and<br>all the weapons of his foe and laughed frightfully. Then, like the clouds<br>pouring torrents of rain on the mountains of Meru, Ghatotkacha poured<br>showers of arrows on Karna, Alamvusha and all the Kurus. Afflicted by the<br>Rakshasa, the Kuru host became exceedingly agitated. The four kinds of<br>forces, of which thy army consisted, began to press and crush one<br>another. Then Jatasura's son, carless and driverless, wrathfully struck<br>Ghatotkacha, in that battle, with his fists. Thus struck, Ghatotkacha<br>trembled like a mountain with its trees and creepers and grass at the<br>time of an earthquake. Then Bhimasena's son, mad with rage, raising his<br>own foe-slaying arm that resembled a spiked mace, dealt a severe blow on<br>Jatasura's son. Crushing him then in rage, Hidimva's son quickly threw<br>him down, and seizing him with his two arms he began to press him with<br>great force upon the earth. Then Jatasura's son freeing himself from<br>Ghatotkacha, rose up and assailed Ghatotkacha with great impetuosity.<br>Alamvusha also, dragging and throwing down the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha, in<br>that battle, began to crush him in rage on the surface of the earth. The<br>battle then that took place between those two roaring and gigantic<br>warriors, viz., Ghatotkacha and Alamvusha, became exceedingly fierce and<br>made the hair stand on end. Endeavouring to prevail over each other by<br>means of their powers of illusion, those two proud warriors, endued with<br>great energy, fought with each other like Indra and Virochana's son.<br>Becoming fire and ocean, and, once more, Garuda and Takshaka, and once<br>again, a cloud and a tempest, and then thunder and a large mountain, and<br>once again, an elephant and then Rahu and the sun, they thus displayed a<br>hundred different kinds of illusion, solicitous of destroying each other.<br>Indeed, Alamvusha and Ghatotkacha fought most wonderfully, striking each<br>other with spiked clubs and maces and lances and mallets and axes and<br>short clubs and mountain-cliffs. Riding on horseback or on elephants, on<br>foot or on car, those foremost of Rakshasas, both endued with large<br>powers of illusion, fought with each other in battle. Then Ghatotkacha, O<br>king, desiring to slay Alamvusha, roared aloft in rage and then alighted<br>with great quickness like a hawk. Seizing then that gigantic prince of<br>Rakshasas, viz., Alamvusha, who thus struggled with him, he pressed him<br>down on the earth, like Vishnu slaying (the Asura) Maya in battle. Taking<br>a scimitar of wonderful appearance, Ghatotkacha, of immeasurable prowess,<br>then cut off from his trunk, O king, his fierce and mighty foe's terrible<br>head that was still uttering awful roars. Seizing that blood-dyed head by<br>the hair, Ghatotkacha quickly proceeded towards Duryodhana's car.<br>Approaching (the Kuru king), the mighty-armed Rakshasa, smiling the<br>while, threw upon Duryodhana's car that head with frightful face and<br>hair. Uttering then a fierce roar, deep as that of the clouds in the<br>season of rains, he addressed Duryodhana, O king, and said, 'This thy<br>ally is now slain, he, that is, whose prowess thou hadst beheld! Thou<br>shalt see the slaughter of Karna again, and then thy own. One that is<br>observant of these three, viz., morality, profit and pleasure, should<br>never see with empty hands a king, a Brahmana, or a woman.[230] Live<br>cheerfully till that time when I slay Karna.' Having said these words, he<br>then, O king, proceeded towards Karna, shooting hundreds of keen arrows<br>upon the head of Karna. The battle then that took place between that<br>human warrior and that Rakshasa, was fierce and terrible, O king, and<br>exceedingly wonderful.'"
