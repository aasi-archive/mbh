                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'When the troops were thus engaged and thus<br>proceeded against one another in separate divisions, how did Partha and<br>the warriors of my army endued with great activity fight? What also did<br>Arjuna do towards the car-warriors of the Samsaptakas? And what, O<br>Sanjaya, did the Samsaptakas, in their turn, do to Arjuna?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'When the troops were thus engaged and proceeded against<br>one another, thy son Duryodhana himself rushed against Bhimasena, leading<br>his elephant division. Like an elephant encountering an elephant, like a<br>bull encountering a bull, Bhimasena, summoned by the king himself, rushed<br>against that elephant division of the Kaurava army. Skilled in battle and<br>endued with great might of arms, Pritha's son, O sire, quickly broke that<br>elephant division. These elephants, huge as hills, and with ichor<br>trickling down from every part of their bodies, were mangled and forced<br>to turn back by Bhimasena with his arrows. Indeed, as the wind, when it<br>riseth, driveth away gathering masses of clouds, so did that son of<br>Pavana rout that elephant force of the Kauravas. And Bhima, shooting his<br>arrows at those elephants, looked resplendent like the risen sun,<br>striking everything in the world with his rays. Those elephants,<br>afflicted with the shafts of Bhima, became covered with blood and looked<br>beautiful like masses of clouds in the welkin penetrated with the rays of<br>the sun. Then Duryodhana, excited with wrath, pierced with the sharp<br>shafts that son of the Wind-god who was causing such a slaughter among<br>his elephants. Then Bhima, with eyes red in wrath, desirous of<br>despatching the king to Yama's abode, pierced him speedily with many<br>sharp shafts. Then Duryodhana, mangled all over with arrows and excited<br>with rage, pierced Bhima, the son of Pandu, with many shafts endued with<br>the effulgence of solar rays, smiling the while. Then the son of Pandu,<br>with a couple of broad-headed arrows, quickly cut off Duryodhana's bow as<br>also his standard, bearing the device of a jewelled elephant, decked with<br>diverse gems. Beholding Duryodhana thus afflicted, O sire, by Bhima, the<br>ruler of the Angas on his elephant came there for afflicting the son of<br>Pandu. Thereupon, Bhimasena deeply pierced with a long arrow that prince<br>of elephants advancing with loud roars, between its two frontal globes.<br>That arrow, penetrating through its body, sank deep in the earth. And at<br>this the elephants fell down like a hill riven by the thunder. While the<br>elephant was falling down, the Mleccha king also was falling down it. But<br>Vrikodara, endued with great activity, cut off his head with a<br>broad-headed arrow before his antagonist actually fell down. When the<br>heroic ruler of the Angas fell, his divisions fled away. Steeds and<br>elephants and car-warriors struck with panic, crushed the foot-soldiers<br>as they fled.<br><br>"When those troops, thus broken, fled away in all directions, the ruler<br>of the Pragjyotishas then advanced against Bhima, upon his elephant.[50]<br>With its two (fore) legs and trunk contracted, filled with rage, and with<br>eyes rolling, that elephant seemed to consume the son of Pandu (like a<br>blazing fire). And it pounded Vrikodara's car with the steed yoked<br>thereto into dust. Then Bhima ran forward and got under the elephant's<br>body, for he knew the science called Anjalikabedha. Indeed, the son of<br>Pandu fled not. Getting under the elephant's body, he began to strike it<br>frequently with his bare arms. And he smote that invincible elephant<br>which was bent upon slaying him. Thereupon, the latter began to quickly<br>turn round like a potter's wheel. Endued with the might of ten thousand<br>elephants, the blessed Vrikodara, having struck that elephant thus, came<br>out from under Supratika's body and stood facing the latter. Supratika<br>then, seizing Bhima by its trunk, threw him down by means of its knees.<br>Indeed, having seized him by the neck, that elephant wished to slay him.<br>Twisting the elephant's trunk, Bhima freed himself from its twine, and<br>once more got under the body of that huge creature. And he waited there,<br>expecting the arrival of a hostile elephant of his own army. Coming out<br>from under the beast's body, Bhima then ran away with great speed. Then a<br>loud noise was heard, made by all the troops, to the effect, 'Alas, Bhima<br>hath been slain by the elephant!' The Pandava host, frightened by that<br>elephant, suddenly fled away, O king, to where Vrikodara was waiting.<br>Meanwhile, king Yudhishthira, thinking Vrikodara to have been slain,<br>surrounded Bhagadatta on all sides, aided by the Panchalas. Having<br>surrounded him with numerous cars, king Yudhishthira that foremost of<br>car-warriors, covered Bhagadatta with keen shafts by hundreds and<br>thousands. Then Bhagadatta, that king of the mountainous regions,<br>frustrating with his iron hook that shower of arrows, began to consume<br>both the Pandavas and the Panchalas by means of that elephant of his.<br>Indeed. O monarch, the feat that we then beheld, achieved by old<br>Bhagadatta with his elephant, was highly wonderful. Then the ruler of the<br>Dasarnas rushed against the king of the Pragjyotisha, on a fleet elephant<br>with temporal sweat trickling down, for attacking Supratika in the flank.<br>The battle then that took place between those two elephants of awful<br>size, resembled that between two winged mountains overgrown with forests<br>in days of old. Then the elephant of Bhagadatta, wheeling round and<br>attacking the elephant of the king of the Dasarnas, ripped open the<br>latter's flank and slew it outright. Then Bhagadatta himself with seven<br>lances bright as the rays of the sun, slew his (human) antagonist seated<br>on the elephant just when the latter was about to fall down from his<br>seat. Piercing king Bhagadatta then (with many arrows), Yudhishthira<br>surrounded him on all sides with a large number of cars. Staying on his<br>elephant amid car-warriors encompassing him all around, he looked<br>resplendent like a blazing fire on a mountain-top in the midst of a dense<br>forest. He stayed fearlessly in the midst of those serried cars ridden by<br>fierce bowmen, all of whom showered upon him their arrows. Then the king<br>of the Pragjyotisha, pressing (with his toe) his huge elephant, urged him<br>towards the car of Yuyudhana. That prodigious beast, then seizing the car<br>of Sinis grandson, hurled it to a distance with great force. Yuyudhana,<br>however, escaped by timely flight. His charioteer also, abandoning the<br>large steeds of the Sindhu breed, yoked unto that car, quickly followed<br>Satyaki and stood where the latter stopped. Meanwhile the elephant,<br>quickly coming out of the circle of cars, began to throw down all the<br>kings (that attempted to bar his course). These bulls among men,<br>frightened out of their wits by that single elephant coursing swiftly,<br>regarded it in that battle as multiplied into many. Indeed, Bhagadatta,<br>mounted on that elephant of his, began to smite down the Pandavas, like<br>the chief of the celestials mounted on Airavata smiting down the Danavas<br>(in days of old).[51] As the Panchalas fled in all directions, loud and<br>awful was the noise that arose amongst them, made by their elephants and<br>steeds. And while the Pandava troops were thus destroyed by Bhagadatta,<br>Bhima, excited with rage, once more rushed against the ruler of the<br>Pragjyotisha. The latter's elephant then frightened the steeds of<br>advancing Bhima by drenching them with water spouted forth from its<br>trunk, and thereupon those animals bore Bhima away from the field. Then<br>Kriti's son, Ruchiparvan, mounted on his car, quickly rushed against<br>Bhagadatta, scattering showers of arrows and advancing like the Destroyer<br>himself. Then Bhagadatta, that ruler of the hilly regions, possessed of<br>beautiful limbs, despatched Ruchiparvan with a straight shaft to Yama's<br>abode.[52] Upon the fall of the heroic Ruchiparvan, Subhadra's son and<br>the sons of Draupadi, and Chekitana, and Dhrishtaketu, and Yuyutsu began<br>to afflict the elephant. Desiring to slay that elephant, all those<br>warriors, uttering loud shouts, began to pour their arrows on the<br>animals, like the clouds drenching the earth with their watery down-pour.<br>Urged then by its skilful rider with heel, hook, and toe the animal<br>advanced quickly with trunk stretched, and eyes and cars fixed. Treading<br>down Yuyutsu's steeds, the animal then slew the charioteer. Thereupon, O<br>king, Yuyutsu, abandoning his car, fled away quickly. Then the Pandava<br>warriors, desirous of slaying that prince of elephants, uttered loud<br>shouts and covered it quickly with showers of arrows. At this time, thy<br>son, excited with rage, rushed against the car of Subhadra's son.<br>Meanwhile, king Bhagadatta on his elephant, shooting shafts on the foe,<br>looked resplendent like the Sun himself scattering his rays on the earth.<br>Arjuna's son then pierced him with a dozen shafts, and Yuyutsu with ten,<br>and each of the sons of Draupadi pierced him with three shafts and<br>Dhrishtaketu also pierced him with three. That elephant then, pierced<br>with these shafts, shot with great care, looked resplendent like a mighty<br>mass of clouds penetrated with the rays of the sun. Afflicted with those<br>shafts of the foe, that elephant then, urged by its riders with skill and<br>vigour, began to throw hostile warriors on both his flanks. Like a<br>cowherd belabouring his cattle in the forest with a goad, Bhagadatta<br>repeatedly smote the Pandava host. Like the cawing of quickly retreating<br>crows when assailed by hawks, a loud and confused noise was heard among<br>the Pandava troops who fled away with great speed. That prince of<br>elephants, struck by its rider with hook, resembled, O king, a winged<br>mountain of old. And it filled the hearts of the enemy with fear, like to<br>what merchants experience at sight of the surging sea.[53] Then elephants<br>and car-warriors and steeds and kings, flying away in fear, made, as they<br>fled, a loud and awful din that, O monarch, filled the earth and sky and<br>heaven and the cardinal and subsidiary directions in that battle. Mounted<br>on that foremost of elephants, king Bhagadatta penetrated the hostile<br>army like the Asura Virochana in days of old into the celestial host in<br>battle well-protected by the gods. A violent wind began to blow; a dusty<br>cloud covered the sky and the troops; and people regarded that single<br>elephant as multiplied into many, coursing all over the field.'"
