                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'When the van of my army thus slaughtered by the<br>diadem-decked (Arjuna) broke and fled, who were those heroes that<br>advanced against Arjuna? (Did any of them actually fight with Arjuna, or)<br>did all, abandoning their determination enter the Sakata array, getting<br>behind the fearless Drona, resembling a solid wall?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'When Indra's son Arjuna, O sinless one, began, with his<br>excellent arrows, to break and incessantly slay that force of ours many<br>heroes were either slain, or becoming dispirited, fled away. None in that<br>battle, was capable of even looking at Arjuna. Then, thy son Duhsasana,<br><br>O king, beholding that state of the troops, became filled with wrath and<br>rushed against Arjuna for battle. That hero of fierce prowess, cased in a<br>beautiful coat of mail, made of gold, and his head covered with a turban<br>decked with gold, caused Arjuna to be surrounded by a large<br>elephant-force which seemed capable of devouring the whole earth. With<br>sound of the elephants' bells, the blare of conchs, the twang of<br>bow-strings, and the grunts of the tuskers, the earth, the points of<br>compass, and the welkin, seemed to be entirely filled. That period of<br>time became fierce and awful. Beholding those huge beasts with extended<br>trunks filled with wrath and rushing quickly towards him, like winged<br>mountains urged on with hooks, Dhananjaya, that lion among men, uttering<br>a leonine shout, began to pierce and slay that elephant-force with his<br>shafts. And like a Makara penetrating into the vast deep, surging into<br>mountain waves when agitated by the tempest, the diadem-decked (Arjuna)<br>penetrated into that elephant-host. Indeed, Partha, that subjugator of<br>hostile cities, was then seen by all on every side to resemble the<br>scorching sun that rises, transgressing the rule about direction and<br>hour, on the day of the universal destruction. And in consequence of the<br>sound of horses' hoofs, rattle of car-wheels, the shouts of combatants,<br>the twang of bow-strings, the noise of diverse musical instruments, the<br>blare of Panchajanya and Devadatta, and roar of Gandiva, men and<br>elephants were dispirited and deprived of their senses. And men and<br>elephants were riven by Savyasachin with his shafts whose touch resembled<br>that of snakes of virulent poison. And those elephants, in that battle,<br>were pierced all over their bodies with shafts, numbering thousands upon<br>thousands shot from Gandiva. While thus mangled by the diadem-decked<br>(Arjuna), they uttered loud noises and incessantly fell down on the earth<br>like mountains shorn of their wings. Others struck at the jaw, or frontal<br>globes, or temples with long shafts, uttered cries resembling those of<br>cranes. The diadem-decked (Arjuna) began to cut off, with his straight<br>arrows the heads of warriors standing on the necks of elephants. Those<br>heads decked with ear-rings, constantly falling on the earth, resembled a<br>multitude of lotuses that Partha was calling for an offer to his gods.<br>And while the elephants wandered on the field, many warriors were seen to<br>hang from their bodies, divested of armour, afflicted with wounds,<br>covered with blood, and looking like painted pictures. In some instances,<br>two or three warriors, pierced by one arrow winged with beautiful<br>feathers and well-shot (from Gandiva), fell down on the earth. Many<br>elephants deeply pierced with long shafts, fell down, vomiting blood from<br>their mouths, with the riders on their backs, like hills overgrown with<br>forests tumbling down through some convulsion of nature. Partha, by means<br>of his straight shafts, cut into fragments the bow-strings, standards,<br>bows, yokes, and shafts of the car-warriors opposed to him. None could<br>notice when Arjuna took up his arrows, when he fixed them on the<br>bow-string, when he drew the string, and when he let them off. All that<br>could be seen was that Partha seemed to dance on his car with his bow<br>incessantly drawn to a circle. Elephants, deeply pierced with long shafts<br>and vomiting blood from their mouths, fell down, as soon as they were<br>struck, on the earth. And in the midst of that great carnage, O monarch,<br>innumerable headless trunks were seen to stand up. Arms, with bows in<br>grasp, or whose fingers were cased in leathern gloves, holding swords, or<br>decked with Angadas and other ornaments of gold, cut off from trunks,<br>were seen lying about. And the field of battle was strewn with<br>innumerable Upashkaras and Adhishthanas, and shafts, and crowns, crushed<br>car-wheels, and broken Akshas, and yokes, and warriors armed with shields<br>and bows, and floral garlands, and ornaments and robes and fallen<br>standards. And in consequence of those slain elephants and steeds, and<br>the fallen bodies of Kshatriyas, the earth there assumed an awful aspect.<br>Duhsasana's forces, thus slaughtered, O king, by the diadem-decked<br>(Arjuna), fled away. Their leader himself was in great pain, for<br>Duhsasana, greatly afflicted by those shafts, overcome by fear entered<br>with his division the Sakata array, seeking Drona as his deliverer.'"
