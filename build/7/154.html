                            "Dhritarashtra said, "When the invincible Drona, of immeasurable energy,<br>unable to bear (the slaughter of Jayadratha), Wrathfully entered into the<br>midst of the Srinjayas, what did all of you think? When that warrior of<br>immeasurable soul, having said those words unto my disobedient son,<br>Duryodhana, so entered (the hostile ranks), what steps did Partha take?<br>When after the fall of the heroic Jayadratha and of Bhurisravas, that<br>unvanquished warrior of great energy, that scorcher of foes, viz., the<br>unconquerable Drona, proceeded against the Panchalas, what did Arjuna<br>think? What also did Duryodhana think as the most seasonable step that he<br>could adopt? Who were they that followed that boon-giving hero, that<br>foremost of regenerated ones? Who were those heroes, O Suta, that stood<br>behind that hero while engaged in 'battle? Who fought in his van, while<br>he was employed in slaughter? I think, all the Pandavas, afflicted with<br>the arrows of Bharadwaja's son, were, O Suta, like lean kine trembling<br>under a wintry sky. Having penetrated into the midst of the Panchalas how<br>did that great bowman, that scorcher of foes, that tiger among men, meet<br>with his death?[194] When on that night all the troops, united together,<br>and all the great car-warriors combined were being separately ground (by<br>Drona), who were those intelligent men amongst you that were present<br>there? Thou sayest that my troops were slain or huddled together, or<br>vanquished, and that my car-warriors were made carless in those<br>encounters. While those combatants became cheerless and were being ground<br>by the Pandavas, what did they think when they sank in such affliction on<br>that dark night? Thou sayest that the Pandavas were hearty and<br>exceedingly hopeful, and that mine were melancholy and heartless and<br>panic-stricken. How, O Sanjaya, couldst thou mark the distinction on that<br>night between the Kurus and the unretreating Parthas?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'During the progress, O king, of that fierce night-battle,<br>the Pandavas along with the Somakas all rushed against Drona. Then Drona,<br>with his swift-going shafts, despatched all the Kaikeyas and the sons of<br>Dhrishtadyumna into the world of spirits. Indeed, all those mighty<br>car-warriors, O king, that advanced right against Drona, all those lords<br>of the earth, were despatched (by him) into the region of the dead. Then<br>king Sivi, of great prowess, filled with rage, proceeded against that<br>mighty car-warrior, viz., the heroic son of Bharadwaja, while the latter<br>was thus employed in grinding (the hostile combatants). Beholding that<br>great car-warrior of the Pandavas advancing, Drona pierced him with ten<br>shafts made entirely of iron. Sivi, however, pierced Drona in return with<br>thirty shafts, winged with Kanka feathers. And smiling the while, he<br>also, with a broad-headed shaft felled the driver of Drona's car. Drona<br>then, slaying the steeds of the illustrious Sivi as also the driver of<br>his car, cut off from his trunk Sivi's head with head-gear on it. Then<br>Duryodhana quickly sent unto Drona a driver for his car. The reins of his<br>steeds having been taken up by the new man, Drona once more rushed<br>against his foes. The sort of the ruler of the Kalingas, supported by the<br>Kalinga troops, rushed against Bhimasena, filled with rage at the<br>slaughter of his sire by the latter, Having pierced Bhima with five<br>shafts he once more pierced him with seven. And he struck Visoka (the<br>driver of Bhima's car) with three shafts and the latter's standard with<br>one. The Vrikodara, filled with rage, leaping from his own car to that of<br>his foe, slew with only his fists that angry hero of the Kalingas. The<br>bones of that prince thus slain in battle by the mighty son of Pandu with<br>only his fists, fell down on the earth separated from one another, Karna<br>and the brother of the slain prince, (and others), could not brook that<br>act of Bhima. All of them began to strike Bhimasena with keen shafts<br>resembling snakes of virulent poison. Abandoning then that car of the foe<br>(upon which he stood), Bhima proceeded to the car of Dhruva,[195] and<br>crushed, by a blow of his fist, that prince who had been striking him<br>incessantly. Thus struck by the mighty son of Pandu. Dhruva fell down.<br>Having slain him, O king, Bhimasena of great strength, proceeding to the<br>car of Jayarata, began to roar repeatedly like a lion. Dragging Jayarata<br>then with his left arm, while, employed in roaring, he slew that warrior<br>with a slap of his palm in the very sight of Karna. Then Karna hurled at<br>the son of Pandu, a dart decked with gold. The Pandava, however, smiling<br>the while, seized with his hand that dart. And the invincible Vrikodara<br>in that battle hurled that very dart back at Karna. Then Sakuni, with a<br>shaft that had drunk oil, cut off that dart as it coursed towards Karna.<br>Having achieved these mighty feats in battle, Bhima, of wonderful<br>prowess, came back to his own car and rushed against thy troops. And<br>while Bhima was thus advancing, slaughtering (thy troops) like the<br>Destroyer himself in rage, thy sons, O monarch, attempted to resist that<br>mighty-armed hero. Indeed, those mighty car-warriors covered him with a<br>dense shower of arrows. Then Bhima, smiling the while, despatched in that<br>battle, with his shafts, the driver and the steeds of Durmada unto the<br>abode of Yama. Durmada, at this, quickly mounted upon the car of<br>Dushkarna. Then those scorchers of foes, viz., the two brothers, riding<br>oh the same car, both rushed against Bhima in the front rank of battle,<br>like the Regent of the waters and Surya rushing against Taraka, that<br>foremost of Daityas. Then thy sons, Durmada and Dushkarna, mounting on<br>the same car, pierced Bhima with shafts. Then in the very sight of Karna,<br>of Aswatthaman, of Duryodhana, of Kripa, of Somadatta, and of Valhika,<br>the son of Pandu, that chastiser of foes, by a stamp of his foot, caused<br>that car of the heroic Durmada and Dushkarna to sink into the earth.<br>Filled with rage, Bhima struck with his fists those mighty and brave sons<br>of thine, viz., Durmada and Dushkarna, and crushed them therewith and<br>roared aloud. Then cries of Oh and Alas arose among the troops. And the<br>kings, beholding Bhima said, 'That is Rudra who is fighting in Bhima's<br>form among the Dhartarashtras.' Saying these words, O Bharata, all the<br>kings fled away, deprived of their senses and urging the animals they<br>rode to their greatest speed. Indeed, no two of them could be seen<br>running together. Then, when on that night a great carnage had been<br>caused among the (Kaurava) army, the mighty Vrikodara, with eyes<br>beautiful as the full-blown lotus, highly applauded by many bulls among<br>kings, repairing unto Yudhishthira, paid his regards unto him. Then the<br>twins (Nakula and Sahadeva), and Drupada and Virata, and the Kaikeyas,<br>and Yudhishthira also, felt great joy. And all of them paid their<br>adorations unto Vrikodara even as the celestials did unto Mahadeva after<br>Andhaka had been slain. Then thy sons, all equal unto the sons of Varuna,<br>filled with rage and accompanied by the illustrious Preceptor and a large<br>number of cars, foot-soldiers, and elephants encompassed Vrikodara on all<br>sides from desire of fight. Then, O best of kings, on that terrible<br>night, when everything was enveloped in darkness, as thick as a cloud, a<br>dreadful battle took place between those illustrious warriors, delightful<br>to wolves and crows and vultures.'"
