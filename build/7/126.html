                            "Bhima said, That car which formerly bore Brahma and Isana and Indra and<br>Varuna (to battle), mounting upon that car, have two Krishnas gone. They<br>can have no fear of danger, Taking, however, thy command on MY head, lo,<br>I am going. Do not grieve. Meeting with those tigers among men, I shall<br>send thee intelligence.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Having said those words, the mighty Bhima began to<br>prepare for setting out, repeatedly making over Yudhishthira to<br>Dhrishtadyumna and the other friends (of the Pandava cause). Indeed,<br>Bhimasena of mighty strength addressing Dhrishtadyumna, said, 'It is<br>known to thee, O thou of mighty arms, how the mighty car-warrior Drona is<br>always on the alert to seize king Yudhishthira the Just by all means in<br>his power. Indeed, O son of Prishata, I should never place my going (to<br>Arjuna and Satyaki) above my duty of protecting the king. King<br>Yudhishthira, however, hath commanded me to go, I dare not contradict<br>him. I shall go thither where the ruler of the Sindhus stayeth, at the<br>point of death. I should, in complete truthfulness, act according to the<br>words of my brother (Arjuna) and of Satyaki endued with great<br>intelligence. Thou shouldst, therefore, vigorously resolved on fight,<br>protect Yudhishthira the son of Pritha today. Of all tasks, this is thy<br>highest duty in battle.' Thus addressed by Vrikodara, O monarch,<br>Dhrishtadyumna replied, 'I shall do what thou wishest. Go, O son of<br>Pritha, without any anxiety of the kind. Without slaying Dhrishtadyumna<br>in battle, Drona will never be able to humiliate king Yudhishthira in the<br>fight.' Thus making the royal son of Pandu over to Dhrishtadyumna, and<br>saluting his elder brother, Bhimasena, proceeded towards the spot where<br>Phalguna was. Before dismissing him, however, king Yudhishthira the Just,<br>O Bharata, embraced Bhimasena and smelt his head and pronounced<br>auspicious blessings upon him. After circumambulating a number of<br>Brahmanas, gratified with worship and presents, and touching the eight<br>kinds of auspicious articles, and quaffing Kairataka honey, that hero,<br>the corners of whose eyes had become red in intoxication, felt his might<br>to be doubled. The Brahmanas performed propitiatory ceremonies for him.<br>Various omens, indicative of success, greeted him. Beholding them, he<br>felt the delight of anticipated victory. Favourable winds began to blow<br>and indicate his success. Then the mighty-armed Bhimasena, the foremost<br>of car-warriors, clad in mail, decked with earrings and Angadas, and his<br>hands cased in leathern fences, mounted on his own excellent car. His<br>costly coat of mail, made of black steel and decked with gold, looked<br>like a cloud charged with lightning. His body Was beautifully covered<br>with yellow and red and black and white robes. Wearing a coloured cuirass<br>that protected also his neck, Bhimasena looked resplendent like a cloud<br>decked with a rainbow.<br><br>"While Bhimasena was on the point of setting out against thy troops from<br>desire of battle, the fierce blasts of Panchajanya were once more heard.<br>Hearing those loud and terrible blasts, capable of filling the three<br>Worlds with fear, the son of Dharma once more addressed Bhimasena,<br>saying, 'There, the Vrishni hero is fiercely blowing his conch. Indeed,<br>that Prince of conchs is filling the earth and the welkin with its sound.<br>Without doubt, Savyasachin having fallen into great distress, the bearer<br>of the discus and the mace is battling with all the Kurus. Without doubt,<br>the venerable Kunti, and Draupadi, and Subhadra, are all, with their<br>relatives and friends, beholding today exceedingly inauspicious omens.<br>Therefore, O Bhima, go thither with speed where Dhananjaya is. All the<br>points of the compass, O Partha, seem empty to my eyes in consequence of<br>my (unsatisfied) desire to see Dhananjaya and owing also to Satwata.,<br>Repeatedly urged by his superior to go, the valiant son of Pandu, viz.,<br>Bhimasena, O king, casing his hands in leathern fence, took up his bow.<br>Urged by his eldest brother, that brother, Bhimasena, who was devoted to<br>his brother's good, caused drums to be beat. And Bhima forcibly blew his<br>conch also and uttering leonine roars, began to twang his bow. Damping<br>the hearts of hostile heroes by those leonine roars, and assuming a<br>dreadful form, he rushed against his foes. Swift and well-broken steeds<br>of the foremost breed neighing furiously, bore him. Endued with the speed<br>of the wind or thought, their reins were held by Visoka. Then the son of<br>Pritha, drawing the bowstring with great force, began to crush the head<br>of the hostile array, mangling and piercing the combatants there. And as<br>that mighty-armed hero proceeded, the brave Panchalas and the Somakas<br>followed him behind, like the celestials following Maghavat. Then the<br>brothers Duhsasana and Chitrasena. and Kundabhedin and Vivinsati, and<br>Durmukha and Duhsaha and Sala, and Vinda and Anuvinda and Sumukha and<br>Dirghavahu and Sudarsana, and Suhasta and Sushena. and Dirghalochana, and<br>Abhaya and Raudrakarman and Suvarman and Durvimochana, approaching,<br>encompassed Bhimasena. These foremost of car-warriors, these heroes, all<br>looking resplendent, with their troops and followers, firmly resolved<br>upon battle, rushed against Bhimasena. That heroic and mighty<br>car-warrior, viz., Kunti's son Bhimasena of great prowess, thus<br>encompassed, cast his eyes on them, and rushed against them with the<br>impetuosity of a lion against smaller animals. Those heroes, displaying<br>celestial and mighty weapons, covered Bhima with shafts, like clouds<br>shrouding the risen sun. Transgressing all those warriors with<br>impetuosity, Bhimasena rushed against Drona's division, and covered the<br>elephant-force before him with showers of arrows. The son of the<br>Wind-god, mangling with his shafts almost in no time that elephant<br>division dispersed it in all directions. Indeed, like animals terrified<br>in the forest at the roar of a Sarabha, those elephants all fled away,<br>uttering frightful cries. Passing over that ground with speed, he then<br>approached the division of Drona. Then the preceptor checked his course,<br>like the continent resisting the surging sea. Smilingly, he struck the<br>son of Pandu in his forehead with a shaft. Thereupon, the son of Pandu<br>looked resplendent like the sun with upward rays. The preceptor thought<br>that Bhima would show him reverence as Phalguna had done before.<br>Addressing Vrikodara, therefore, he said, 'O Bhimasena, it is beyond thy<br>power to enter into the hostile host, without vanquishing me, thy foe, in<br>battle, O thou of mighty strength! Although Krishna with thy younger<br>brother hath penetrated this host with my permission, thyself, however,<br>will never succeed in doing so.' Hearing these words of the preceptor,<br>the dauntless Bhima, excited with wrath, and his eyes red as blood or<br>burnished copper, quickly replied unto Drona, saying, 'O wretch of a<br>Brahmana, it cannot be that Arjuna hath entered this host with thy<br>permission. He is invisible. He would penetrate into the host commanded<br>by Sakra himself. If he offered thee reverential worship, it was only for<br>honouring thee. But know, O Drona, that myself, I am not compassionate<br>like Arjuna. On the other hand, I am Bhimasena, thy foe. We regard thee<br>as our father, preceptor, and friend. Ourselves we look upon as thy sons.<br>Thinking so we always humble ourselves to thee. When, however, thou usest<br>such words towards us today, it seems that all that is altered. If thou<br>regardest thyself as our foe, let it be as thou thinkest. Being none else<br>than Bhima, I will presently act towards thee as I should towards a foe.'<br>Saying this, Bhima whirling a mace, like the Destroyer himself whirling<br>his fatal rod, hurled it, O king, at Drona. Drona, however, had quickly<br>jumped down from his car, (and that proved his safety). For that mace<br>pressed down into the earth the car of Drona, with its steeds, driver,<br>and standard. Then Bhima crushed numerous warriors like the tempest<br>crushing trees with its force. Then those sons of thine once more<br>encompassed that foremost of car-warriors. Meanwhile, Drona, that<br>foremost of smiters mounting another chariot, proceeded to the gate of<br>the array and stayed there for battle. Then, O king, the angry Bhima of<br>great prowess, covered the car-division in his front with showers of<br>shafts. Then those mighty car-warriors, viz., thy sons, thus struck in<br>battle, endued as they were with great strength fought with Bhima from<br>desire of victory. Then Duhsasana, excited with wrath, hurled at<br>Bhimasena a keen dart made entirely of iron, wishing to slay the son of<br>Pandu. Bhima however, cut in twain that fierce dart hurled by thy son, as<br>it coursed towards him. This feat seemed exceedingly wonderful. The<br>mighty son of Pandu, then, with three other keen shafts, slew the three<br>brothers Kundabhedin and Sushena and Dirghanetra. And, again, amongst<br>those heroic sons of thine battling with him, Bhima slew heroic<br>Vrindaraka, that enhancer of the fame of the Kurus. And again, with three<br>other shafts, Bhima slew three other sons of thine, viz., Abhaya and<br>Raudrakarman and Durvimochana. Thus slaughtered, O king, by that mighty<br>warrior, thy sons surrounded, Bhima, that foremost of smiters on all<br>sides. They then showered their arrows upon that son of Pandu, of<br>terrible deeds, like the cloud at the end of summer pouring torrents of<br>rain on the mountain-breast. That slayer of hosts, the heir of Pandu,<br>received that arrowy shower, like a mountain receiving a shower of<br>stones. Indeed, the heroic Bhima felt no pain. Then the son of Kunti,<br>smiling the while, despatched by means of his shafts thy son Vinda and<br>Anuvinda and Suvarman to the abode of Yama. Then the son of Pandu, O bull<br>of Bharata's race, quickly pierced in that battle thy heroic son<br>Sudarsan. The latter, thereupon, fell down and expired. Within a very<br>short time, the son of Pandu, casting his glances on that car-force<br>caused it by his shafts to fly away in all directions. Then like a herd<br>of deer frightened at the clatter of car-wheels, or a loud shout, thy<br>sons, in that battle, O king, afflicted with the fear of Bhimasena,<br>suddenly broke and fled. The son of Kunti, however, pursued that large<br>force of thy sons, and began, O king, to pierce the Kauravas from every<br>side. Thy soldiers, O monarch, thus slaughtered by Bhimasena, fled away<br>from battle, avoiding the son of Pandu and urging their own excellent<br>steeds to their greatest speed. The mighty Bhimasena then, having<br>vanquished them in battle, uttered leonine roars and made a great noise<br>by slapping his armpits. And the mighty Bhima, having made also a fierce<br>noise with his palms, and thereby frightened that car-force and the<br>foremost of warriors that were in it, passed towards the division of<br>Drona, transgressing that car-force (which he had vanquished.)'
