                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'I regard Bhimasena's prowess to be exceedingly<br>wonderful, inasmuch as he succeeded in battling with Karna of singular<br>activity and energy. Indeed, O Sanjaya, tell me why that Karna, who is<br>capable of resisting in battle the very celestials with the Yakshas and<br>Asuras and men, armed with all kinds of weapons, could not vanquish in<br>battle Pandu's son Bhima blazing with resplendence? O tell me, how that<br>battle took place between them in which each staked his very life. I<br>think that in an encounter between the two, success is within reach of<br>both as, indeed, both are liable to defeat.[156] O Suta, obtaining Karna<br>in battle, my son Suyodhana always ventures to vanquish the sons of<br>Pritha with Govinda and the Satwatas. Hearing, however, of the repeated<br>defeat in battle of Karna by Bhimasena of terrible deeds, a swoon seems<br>to come upon me, I think, the Kauravas to be already slain, in<br>consequence of evil policy of my son. Karna will never succeed, O<br>Sanjaya, in vanquishing those mighty bowmen, viz., the sons of Pritha. In<br>all the battles that Karna has fought with the sons of Pandu, the latter<br>have invariably defeated him on the field. Indeed, O son, the Pandavas<br>are incapable of being vanquished by the very gods with Vasava at their<br>head. Alas, my wicked son Duryodhana knoweth it not. Having robbed<br>Pritha's son, who is like the Lord of the treasures himself, of his<br>wealth, my son of little intelligence seeth not the fall like a searcher<br>of honey (in the mountains). Conversant with deceit, he regardeth it to<br>be irrevocably his and always insulteth the Pandavas. Myself also, of<br>unrefined soul, overcome with affection for my children, scrupled not to<br>despise the high-souled sons of Pandu that are observant of morality.<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Pritha, of great foresight, always showed<br>himself desirous of peace. My sons, however, regarding him incapable,<br>despised him. Bearing in mind all those woes and all the wrongs<br>(sustained by the Pandavas), the mighty-armed Bhimasena battled with the<br>Suta's son. Tell me, therefore, O Sanjaya, how Bhima and Karna, those two<br>foremost of warriors, fought with each other, desirous of taking each<br>other's life!'<br><br>`Sanjaya said, 'Hear, O king, how the battle took place between Karna and<br>Bhima which resembled an encounter between two elephants in the forest,<br>desirous of slaying each other. The son of Vikartana, O king, excited<br>with rage and putting forth his prowess, pierced that chastiser of foes,<br>viz., the angry Bhima of great prowess with thirty shafts. Indeed, O<br>chief of Bharata's race, Vikartana's son struck Bhima with many arrows of<br>keen points, decked with gold, and endued with great impetuosity. Bhima,<br>however, with three sharp shafts cut off the bow of Karna, as the latter<br>was engaged in striking him. And with a broad-headed arrow, the son of<br>Pandu then felled on the earth Karna's charioteer from his niche in the<br>car. The son of Vikartana, then desirous of slaying Bhimasena, seized a<br>dart whose shaft was adorned with gold and stones of lapis lazuli.<br>Grasping that fierce dart, which resembled a second dart of death, and<br>uplifting and aiming it, the mighty son of Radha hurled it at Bhimasena<br>with a force sufficient to take away Bhima's life. Hurling that dart,<br>like Purandara hurling the thunderbolt, Radha's son of great strength<br>uttered a loud roar. Hearing that roar thy sons became filled with<br>delight. Bhima, however, with seven swift arrows, cut off in the welkin<br>that dart endued with the effulgence of the sun or fire, hurled from the<br>hands of Karna. Cutting off that dart, resembling a snake just freed from<br>its slough, Bhima, O sire, as if on the lookout for taking the<br>life-breath of the Suta's son, sped, in great wrath, many shafts in that<br>battle that were equipped with peacock-feathers and golden wings and each<br>of which, whetted of' stone, resembled the rod of Yama. Karna also of<br>great energy, taking up another formidable bow, the back of whose staff<br>was adorned with gold, and drawing it with force, shot many shafts. The<br>son of Pandu, however, cut off all those arrows with nine straight arrows<br>of his own. Having cut off, O ruler of men those mighty shafts shot by<br>Vasushena, Bhima, O monarch, uttered a loud roar like that of a lion.<br>Roaring at each other like two mighty bulls for the sake of a cow in<br>season, or like two tigers for the sake of the same piece of meat, they<br>endeavoured to strike each other, each being desirous of finding the<br>other's laches. At times they looked at each other with angry eyes, like<br>two mighty bulls in a cow-pen. Then like two huge elephants striking each<br>other with the points of their tusks, they encountered each other with<br>shafts shot from their bows drawn to the fullest stretch. Scorching each<br>other, O king, with their arrowy showers, they put forth their prowess<br>upon each other, eyeing each other in great wrath. Sometimes laughing at<br>each other, and sometimes rebuking each other, and sometimes blowing<br>their conchs, they continued to fight with each other. Then Bhima once<br>more cut Karna's bow at the handle, O sire, and despatched by means of<br>his shafts the latter's steeds, white as conchs, to the abode of Yama,<br>and the son of Pandu also felled his enemy's charioteer from his niche in<br>the car. Then Karna, the son of Vikartana, made steedless and driverless,<br>and covered in that battle (with shafts), became plunged into great<br>anxiety. Stupefied by Bhima with his arrowy showers, he knew not what to<br>do. Beholding Karna placed in the distressful plight, king Duryodhana,<br>trembling with wrath, commended (his brother) Durjaya, saying, 'Go, O<br>Durjaya! There the son of Pandu is about to devour the son of Radha! Slay<br>that beardless Bhima soon, and infuse strength into Karna!' Thus<br>addressed, the son Durjaya, saying unto Duryodhana, 'So be it', rushed<br>towards Bhimasena engaged (with Karna) and covered him with arrows. And<br>Durjaya struck Bhima with nine shafts, his steeds with eight, his driver<br>with six, his standard with three, and once more Bhima himself with<br>seven. Then Bhimasena, excited with wrath, piercing with his shafts the<br>very vitals of Durjaya, and his steeds and driver, despatched them of<br>Yama's abode. Then Karna, weeping in grief, circumambulated that son of<br>thine, who, adorned with ornaments, lay on the earth, writhing like a<br>snake. Bhima then, having made that deadly foe of his, viz., Karna,<br>carless, smiling by covered him with shafts and made him look like a<br>Sataghni with numberless spikes on it. The Atiratha Karna, however, that<br>chastiser of foes, though thus pierced with arrows, did not yet avoid the<br>enraged Bhima in battle.'"
