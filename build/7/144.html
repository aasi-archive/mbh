                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'After the Kuru warrior Bhurisravas had been slain<br>under those circumstances, tell me, O Sanjaya, how proceeded the battle.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'After Bhurisravas had proceeded to the other world, O<br>Bharata, the mighty-armed Arjuna urged Vasudeva, saying, "Urge the<br>steeds, O Krishna, to greater speed for taking me to the spot where king<br>Jayadratha is. O sinless one, the sun is quickly proceeding towards the<br>Asta hills. O tiger among men, this great task should be achieved by me.<br>The ruler of the Sindhus is, again, protected by many mighty car-warriors<br>among the Kuru army. Urge thou the steeds, therefore, O Krishna, in such<br>a way that I may, by slaying Jayadratha before the sun sets, make my vow<br>true.' Then the mighty-armed Krishna conversant with horse-lore, urged<br>those steeds of silvery hue towards the car of Jayadratha. Then, O king,<br>many leaders of the Kuru army, such as Duryodhana and Karna and<br>Vrishasena and the ruler of the Sindhus himself, rushed with speed, O<br>king, against Arjuna whose shafts were never baffled and who was<br>proceeding, on his car drawn by steeds of great fleetness. Vibhatsu,<br>however, getting at the ruler of the Sindhus who was staying before him,<br>and casting his glances upon him, seemed to scorch him with his eyes<br>blazing with wrath. Then, king Duryodhana, quickly addressed the son of<br>Radha. Indeed, O monarch, thy son Suyodhana said unto Karna, 'O son of<br>Vikartana, that time of battle hath come at last. O high-souled one,<br>exhibit now thy might. O Karna, act in such a way that Jayadratha may not<br>be slain by Arjuna! O foremost of men, the day is about to expire, strike<br>now the foe with clouds of shafts! If the day expire, O foremost of men,<br>victory, O Karna, will certainly be ours! If the ruler of the Sindhus can<br>be protected till the setting of the sun, then Partha, his vow being<br>falsified, will enter into blazing fire. O giver of honours, the<br>brothers, then, of Arjuna, with all their followers, will not be able to<br>live for even a moment in a world that is destitute of Arjuna! Upon the<br>death of the sons of Pandu, the whole of the earth, O Karna, with her<br>mountains and waters and forests, we will enjoy without a thorn on our<br>side! O giver of honours, it seems that Partha, who without ascertaining<br>what is practicable and what is impracticable, made this vow in battle,<br>was afflicted by destiny itself, his judgment having taken a misdirected<br>course! Without doubt, O Karna, the diadem-decked son of Pandu must have<br>made this vow about the slaughter of Jayadratha for his own destruction!<br>How, O son of Radha, when thou art alive will Phalguna succeed in slaying<br>the ruler of the Sindhus before the sun goes to the Asta hills? How will<br>Dhananjaya slay Jayadratha in battle when the latter is protected by the<br>king of the Madras and by the illustrious Kripa? How will Vibhatsu, who<br>seems to have been urged on by Fate, get at the ruler of the Sindhus when<br>the latter if protected by Drona's son, by myself, and Duhsasana? Many<br>are the heroes engaged in fight. The sun is hanging low in the sky.<br>Partha will not even get at Jayadratha in battle, O giver of honours. Do<br>thou therefore, O Karna, with myself and other brave and mighty<br>car-warriors, with Drona's son and the ruler of the Madras and Kripa<br>fight with Partha in battle, exerting thyself with the greatest firmness<br>and resolution.' Thus addressed by thy son, O sire, the son of Radha<br>replied unto Duryodhana, that foremost one among the Kurus, in these<br>words, 'Deeply hath my body been pierced in battle by the brave bowman<br>Bhimasena, capable of striking vigorously with repeated showers of<br>arrows. O giver of honours, that I am yet present in battle is because<br>that one like me should be present here. Scorched with the powerful<br>shafts of Bhimasena, every limb of mine is suffering from torturing pain<br>I shall, however, for all that, fight to the best of my powers. My life<br>itself is for thee. I shall strive my best so that this foremost one of<br>the sons of Pandu may not succeed in slaying the ruler of the Sindhus. As<br>long as I shall fight, shooting my whetted shafts, the heroic Dhananjaya,<br>capable of drawing the bow with even his left hand, will not succeed in<br>getting at the ruler of the Sindhus. All that a person, bearing love and<br>affection to thee and always solicitous of thy good, may do, shall be<br>done by me, O thou of Kuru's race! As regards victory, that depends on<br>destiny. I shall in battle today exert myself to my utmost for the sake<br>of the ruler of the Sindhus, and for achieving thy good. O king, victory,<br>however, is dependent on destiny. Relying on my manliness, I shall fight<br>with Arjuna today for thy sake, O tiger among men! Victory, however, is<br>dependent on destiny. O chief of the Kurus, let all the troops behold<br>today the fierce battle, making the very hair stand on end, that takes<br>place between myself and Arjuna.' While Karna and the Kuru king were thus<br>talking to each other in battle, Arjuna began, with his keen arrows, to<br>slaughter thy host. With his broad-headed arrows of great sharpness he<br>began to cut off in that battle the arms, looking like spiked clubs or<br>the trunks of elephants, of unreturning heroes. And the mighty-armed hero<br>also cut off their heads with whetted shafts. And Vibhatsu also cut off<br>the trunks of elephants and the necks of steeds and the Akshas of cars<br>all around, as also blood-dyed horsemen, armed with spears and lances,<br>with razor-faced arrows into two or three fragments. And steeds and<br>foremost of elephants and standards and umbrellas and bows and Yalk-tails<br>and heads fell fast on all sides. Consuming thy host like a blazing fire<br>consuming a heap of dry grass, Partha soon caused the earth to be covered<br>with blood. And the mighty and invincible Partha, of prowess incapable of<br>being baffled, causing an immense slaughter in that army of thine, soon<br>reached the ruler of the Sindhus. Protected by Bhimasena and by Satwata,<br>Vibhatsu, O chief of the Bharatas, looked resplendent like a blazing<br>fire. Beholding Phalguna in that state, the mighty bowmen of thy army,<br>those bulls among men, endued with wealth of energy, could not brook him.<br>Then Duryodhana and Karna and Vrishasena and the ruler of the Madras, and<br>Aswatthaman and Kripa and the ruler of the Sindhus himself, excited with<br>wrath and fighting for the sake of the Sindhu king, encompassed the<br>diadem-decked Arjuna on all sides. All those warriors, skilled in battle,<br>placing the ruler of the Sindhus at their back, and desirous of slaying<br>Arjuna and Krishna, surrounded Partha, that hero conversant with battle,<br>who was then dancing along the track of his car, producing fierce sounds<br>with the bowstring and his palms and resembling the Destroyer himself<br>with wide-opened mouth. The sun then had assumed a red hue in the sky.<br>Desirous of his (speedy) setting, the Kaurava warriors, bending their<br>bows with arms, resembling the (tapering) bodies of snake sped their<br>shafts in hundreds towards Phalguna, resembling the rays of the sun.<br>Cutting off those shafts thus sped towards him, into two, three, or eight<br>fragments the diadem-decked Arjuna, invincible in battle, pierced them<br>all in that encounter. Then Aswatthaman, bearing on his banner the mark<br>of a lion's tail, displaying his might, began, O king, to resist Arjuna.<br>Indeed, the son of Saradwata's daughter piercing Partha with ten shafts<br>and Vasudeva with seven, stayed in the track of Arjuna's car, protecting<br>the ruler of the Sindhus. Then, many foremost ones among the Kurus, great<br>car-warriors, all encompassed Arjuna, on all sides with a large throng of<br>cars. Stretching their bows and shooting countless shafts, they began to<br>protect the ruler of the Sindhus, at the command of thy son. We then<br>beheld the prowess of the brave Partha as also the inexhaustible<br>character of his shafts, and the might, too, of his bow Gandiva. Baffling<br>with his own weapons those of Drona's son and Kripa, he pierced every one<br>of those warriors with nine shafts. Then, Drona's son pierced him with<br>five and twenty arrows, and Vrishasena with seven, and Duryodhana pierced<br>him with twenty, and Karma and Salya each with three. And all of them<br>roared at him and continued to pierce him frequently, and shaking their<br>bows, they surrounded him on all sides. And soon they caused their cars<br>to be drawn up in a serried line around Arjuna. Desirous of the (speedy)<br>setting of the sun, those mighty car-warriors of the Kaurava army, endued<br>with great activity, began to roar at Arjuna, and shaking their bows,<br>covered him with showers of keen arrows like cloud pouring rain on a<br>mountain. Those brave warriors, with arms resembling heavy clubs, also<br>discharged on that occasion, O king, on Dhananjaya's body celestial<br>weapons. Having caused an immense slaughter in thy army, the mighty and<br>invincible Dhananjaya, of prowess incapable of being baffled came upon<br>the ruler of the Sindhus. Karna, however, O king, with his arrows,<br>resisted him in that battle in the very sight, O Bharata, of Bhimasena<br>and Satwata. The mighty-armed Partha, in the very sight of all the<br>troops, pierced the Suta's son, in return, with ten arrows, on the field<br>of battle. Then Satwata, O sire, pierced Karna with three arrows. And<br>Bhimasena pierced him with three arrows, and Partha himself, once more,<br>with seven. The mighty car-warrior, Karna, then pierced each of those<br>three warriors with sixty arrows. And thus, O king, raged that battle<br>between Karna alone (on one side) and the many (on the other). The<br>prowess, O sire, that we then beheld of the Suta's son was wonderful in<br>the extreme, since, excited with wrath in battle, he singly resisted<br>those three great car-warriors. Then the mighty-armed Phalguna, in that<br>battle, pierced Karna, the son of Vikartana, in all his limbs with a<br>hundred arrows. All his limbs bathed in blood, the Suta's son of great<br>prowess and bravery, pierced Phalguna in return with fifty arrows.<br>Beholding that lightness of hand displayed by him in battle, Arjuna<br>brooked it not. Cutting off his bow, that hero, viz., Dhananjaya, the son<br>of Pritha, quickly pierced Karna in the centre of the chest with nine<br>arrows, Then Dhananjaya, with great speed at a time, when speed was<br>necessary shot in that battle a shaft of solar effulgence for the<br>destruction of Karna. Drona's son, however, with a crescent-shaped arrow,<br>cut off that shaft as it coursed impetuously (towards Karna). Thus cut<br>off by Aswatthaman, that shaft fell down on the earth. Endued with great<br>prowess, the Suta's son, then, O king, took up another bow, and covered<br>the son of Pandu with several thousands of arrows. Partha, however, like<br>the wind dispersing flight of locusts, dispelled with his own arrows that<br>extraordinary shower of arrows issuing out of Karna's bow. Then Arjuna,<br>displaying his lightness of hands, covered Karna, in that battle, with<br>his arrows, in the very sight of all thy troops. Karna also, that slayer<br>of hosts, desirous of counteracting Arjuna's feat, covered Arjuna with<br>several thousands of arrows. Roaring at each other like two bulls, those<br>lions among men, those mighty car-warriors, shrouded the welkin with<br>clouds of straight shafts. Each rendered invisible by the other's arrowy<br>showers, they continued to strike each other. And they roared at each<br>other and pierced each other with their wordy darts, saying, 'I am<br>Partha, wait'&#8212;or, 'I am Karna, wait', O Phalguna! Indeed these two<br>heroes fought with each other wonderfully, displaying great activity and<br>skill. And the sight they presented was such that other warriors became<br>witnesses of that battle. And applauded by Siddhas, Charnas and Pannagas,<br>they fought with each other, O king, each desirous of slaying the other.<br>Then Duryodhana, O king addressing thy warriors, said, 'Carefully protect<br>the son of Radha! Without slaying Arjuna he would not abstain from<br>battle. Even this is what Vrisha told me.' Meanwhile, O monarch,<br>beholding the prowess of Karna, Arjuna, of white steeds, with four shafts<br>shot from the bow-string drawn to the ear, despatched the four steeds of<br>Karna to Yama's domain. And he also felled with a broad-headed arrow,<br>Karna's charioteer from his niche in the car. And he covered Karna<br>himself with clouds of shafts in the very sight of thy son. Thus shrouded<br>with arrows the steedless and driverless Karna, stupefied by that arrowy<br>shower, knew not what to do. Beholding him made carless, Aswatthaman, O<br>king, caused him to ride on his car, and continued to fight with Arjuna.<br>Then the ruler of the Madras pierced the son of Kunti with thirty arrows.<br>Saradwata's son pierced Vasudeva with twenty arrows. And he struck<br>Dhananjaya also with a dozen shafts. And the ruler of the Sindhus pierced<br>each with four arrows, and Vrishasena also pierced each of them, O king,<br>with seven arrows. Kunti's son, Dhananjaya, pierced all of them in<br>return. Indeed, piercing Drona's son with four and sixty shafts, and the<br>ruler of the Madras with a hundred, and the Sindhu king with ten<br>broad-headed arrows, and Vrishasena with three arrows and Saradwata's son<br>with twenty, Partha uttered a loud shout. Desirous of baffling the vow of<br>Savyasachin, thy warriors, excited with wrath, quickly rushed at<br>Dhananjaya from all sides. Then Arjuna, frightening the Dhartarashtras,<br>invoked into existence the Varuna weapon on all sides. The Kauravas,<br>however, on their costly cars, pouring showers of arrows, advanced<br>against the son of Pandu. But, O Bharata, in course of that stupefying<br>and fierce engagement, fraught with the greatest confusion, that price,<br>viz., Arjuna, decked with diadem and gold chain never lost his senses. On<br>the other hand, he continued to pour showers of arrows. Desirous of<br>recovering the kingdom and recollecting all the wrongs he had suffered<br>for twelve years in consequence of the Kurus, the high-souled and<br>immeasurable Arjuna darkened all the points of the compass with shafts<br>from Gandiva. The welkin seemed ablaze with meteors. Innumerable crows,<br>alighting from the sky, perched on the bodies (of dead combatants).<br>Meanwhile, Arjuna continued to slay the foe with his Gandiva, like<br>Mahadeva slaying the Asuras with his Pinaka equipped with tawny<br>string.[174] Then the illustrious Kiritin, that subjugator of (hostile)<br>ranks, dispersing the shafts of the foe by means of his own formidable<br>bow, slaughtered with his arrows many foremost ones among the Kurus,<br>mounted on their foremost of steeds and elephants. Then many kings,<br>taking up heavy maces and clubs of iron and swords and darts and diverse<br>other kinds of powerful weapons, assuming terrible forms, rushed suddenly<br>against Partha in that battle. Then Arjuna, bending with his arms his<br>formidable bow Gandiva which resembled the bow of Indra himself and whose<br>twang was as loud as the roar of the clouds congregating at the end of<br>the Yuga, and laughing the while, went on consuming thy troops and<br>increasing the population of Yama's kingdom. Indeed, that hero caused<br>those enraged warriors with their cars and elephants and with the<br>foot-soldiers and bowmen supporting them, to be deprived of their arms<br>and lives and thus to swell the population of Yama's domain.'"
