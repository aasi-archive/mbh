                            "Sanjaya said, 'While the (Kuru) host was shaken by the grandson of Sini<br>in these places (through which he proceeded), the son of Bharadwaja<br>covered him with a dense shower of arrows. The encounter that then took<br>place between Drona and Satwata in the very sight of all the troops was<br>extremely fierce, like that between Vali and Vasava (in days of old).<br>Then Drona pierced the grandson of Sini on the forehead with three<br>beautiful arrows made entirely of iron and resembling' snakes of virulent<br>poison. Thus pierced on the forehead with those straight shafts,<br>Yuyudhana, O king, looked beautiful like a mountain with three summits.<br>The son of Bharadwaja always on the alert for an opportunity, then sped<br>in that battle many other arrows of Satyaki which resembled the roar of<br>Indra's thunder. Then he of Dasarha's race, acquainted with the highest<br>weapons, cut off all those arrows shot from Drona's bow, with two<br>beautifully winged arrows of his. Beholding that lightness of hand (in<br>Satyaki), Drona, O king, smiling the while, suddenly pierced that bull<br>among the Sinis with thirty arrows. Surpassing by his own lightness the<br>lightness of Yuyudhana, Drona, once more, pierced the latter with fifty<br>arrows and then with a hundred. Indeed, those mangling arrows, O king,<br>issued from Drona's car, like vigorous snakes in wrath issuing through an<br>ant-hill. Similarly, blood-drinking arrows shot by Yuyudhana in hundreds<br>and thousands covered the car of Drona. We did not mark any difference,<br>however, between the lightness of hand displayed by that foremost of<br>regenerate ones and that displayed by him of the Satwata race. Indeed, in<br>this respect, both those bulls among men were equal. Then Satyaki,<br>inflamed with wrath, struck Drona with nine straight arrows. And he<br>struck Drona's standard also with many sharp shafts. And in the sight of<br>Bharadwaja's son, he pierced the latter's driver also with a hundred<br>arrows. Beholding the lightness of hand displayed by Yuyudhana, the<br>mighty car-warrior Drona piercing Yuyudhana's driver with seventy shafts,<br>and each of his (four) steeds with three, cut off with a single arrow the<br>standard that stood on Madhava's car. With another broad-headed arrow,<br>equipped with feathers and with wings of gold, he cut off in that battle<br>the bow of that illustrious hero of Madhu's race. Thereupon, the mighty<br>car-warrior Satyaki, excited with wrath, laid aside that, taking up a<br>huge mace, hurled it at the son of Bharadwaja. Drona, however, with many<br>arrows of diverse forms, resisted that mace, made of iron and twined<br>round with strings, as it coursed impetuously towards him. Then Satyaki,<br>of prowess incapable of being baffled, took up another bow and pierced<br>the heroic son of Bharadwaja with many arrows whetted on stone. Piercing<br>Drona thereby in that battle, Yuyudhana uttered a leonine shout. Drona,<br>however, that foremost of all wielders of weapons, was unable to brook<br>that roar. Taking up a dart made of iron and equipped with golden staff<br>Drona sped it quickly at the car of Madhava. That dart, however, fatal as<br>Death, without touching the grandson of Sini, pierced through the<br>latter's car and entered the earth with a fierce noise. The grandson of<br>Sini then, O king, pierced Drona with many winged arrows. Indeed,<br>striking him on the right arm, Satyaki, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>afflicted him greatly. Drona also, in that battle, O king, cut off the<br>huge bow of Madhava with a crescent-shaped arrow and smote the latter's<br>driver with a dart. Struck with that dart, Yuyudhana's driver swooned<br>away and for a while lay motionless on the terrace of the car. Then, O<br>Monarch, Satyaki, acting as his own driver, achieved a superhuman feat,<br>inasmuch as he continued to fight with Drona and hold the reins himself.<br>Then the mighty car-warrior Yuyudhana struck that Brahmana with a hundred<br>arrows in that battle, and rejoiced exceedingly, O monarch, at the feat<br>he had achieved. Then Drona, O Bharata, sped at Satyaki five arrows.<br>Those fierce arrows, piercing Satyaki's armour, drank his blood in that<br>battle. Thus pierced with those frightful arrows, Satyaki became inflamed<br>with wrath. In return, that hero shot many shafts at him of the golden<br>car. Then felling on the earth with a single shaft, the driver of Drona,<br>he caused next, with his arrows, those driverless steeds of his<br>antagonist to fly away. Thereupon that car was dragged to a distance.<br>Indeed, the bright chariot of Drona, O king, began to trace a thousand<br>circles in the field of battle like a sun in motion. Then all the kings<br>and princes (of the Kaurava host) made a loud uproar, exclaiming, 'Run,<br>Rush, Seize the steeds of Drona.' Quickly abandoning Satyaki in that<br>battle, O monarch, all those mighty car-warriors rushed to the place<br>where Drona was. Beholding those car-warriors run away afflicted with the<br>arrows of Satyaki, thy troops once more broke down and became exceedingly<br>cheerless. Meanwhile, Drona, once more proceeding to the gate of the<br>array, took up his station there, borne away (from Satyaki's presence) by<br>those steeds, fleet as the wind, that had been, afflicted with the shafts<br>of the Vrishni hero. The valiant son of Bharadwaja, beholding the array<br>broken (in his absence) by the Pandavas and the Panchalas, made no<br>endeavour to follow the grandson of Sini, but employed himself in<br>protecting his (broken) array. Checking the Pandavas and the Panchalas<br>then, the Drona fire, blazing up in wrath stayed there, consuming<br>everything, like the sun that rises at the end of the Yuga.'"
