                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding those Samsaptakas once more return to the<br>field, Arjuna addressed the high-souled Vasudeva, saying, 'Urge the<br>steeds, O Hrishikesa, towards the Samsaptakas. They will not give up the<br>battle alive. This is what I think. Today thou shalt witness the terrible<br>might of my arms as also of my bow. Today I shall slay all these, like<br>Rudra slaying creatures (at the end of the Yuga).' Hearing these words,<br>the invincible Krishna smiled, and gladdening him with auspicious<br>speeches, conveyed Arjuna to those places whither the latter desired to<br>go. While borne in battle by those white steeds, that car looked<br>exceedingly resplendent like a celestial car borne along the firmament.<br>And like Sakra's car, O king, in the battle between the gods and the<br>Asuras in days of old, it displayed circular, forward, backward, and<br>diverse other kinds of motion. Then the Narayanas, excited with wrath and<br>armed with diverse weapons, surrounded Dhananjaya, covering him with<br>showers of arrows. And, O bull of Bharata's race, they soon made Kunti's<br>son, Dhananjaya, together with Krishna, entirely invisible in that<br>battle. Then Phalguni, excited with wrath, doubled his energy, and<br>quickly rubbing its string, grasped Gandiva, (firmly) in the battle.<br>Causing wrinkles to form themselves on his brow, sure indications of<br>wrath, the son of Pandu blew his prodigious conch, called Devadatta, and<br>then he shot the weapon called Tvashtra that is capable of slaying large<br>bodies of foes together. Thereupon, thousands of separate forms started<br>into existence there (of Arjuna himself and of Vasudeva). Confounded by<br>those diverse images after the form of Arjuna, the troops began to strike<br>each other, each regarding the other as Arjuna's self.' 'This is Arjuna!'<br>'This is Govinda!' 'They are Pandu's son and he is of Yadu's race!'<br>Uttering such exclamations, and deprived of their senses, they slew one<br>another in that battle. Deprived of their senses by that mighty weapon,<br>they slew one another. Indeed, those warriors (while striking one<br>another) looked beautiful like blossoming Kinsukas. Consuming those<br>thousands of arrows shot by them, that (mighty) weapon despatched those<br>heroes to Yama's abode. Then Vibhatsu, laughing, crushed with his arrows<br>the Lalithya, the Malava, the Mavellaka, and the Trigarta warriors. While<br>those Kshatriyas, urged by fate, were thus slaughtered by that hero, they<br>shot at Partha showers of diverse kinds of arrows. Overwhelmed with those<br>terrible showers of arrows, neither Arjuna, nor his car, nor Kesava,<br>could any longer be seen. Seeing their arrows strike the aim, they<br>uttered joyous shouts. And regarding the two Krishnas as already slain,<br>they joyously waved their garments in the air. And those heroes also blew<br>their conchs and beat their drums and cymbals by thousands, and uttered<br>many leonine shouts, O sire! Then Krishna, covered with sweat, and much<br>weakened, addressed Arjuna, saying, 'Where art thou, O Partha! I do not<br>see thee. Art thou alive, O slayer of foes?' Hearing those words of his,<br>Dhananjaya with great speed dispelled, by means of the Vayavya weapon,<br>that arrowy downpour shot by his foes. Then the illustrious Vayu (the<br>presiding deity of that mighty weapon) bore away crowds of Samsaptakas<br>with steeds and elephants and cars and weapons, as if these were dry<br>leaves of trees. Borne away by the wind, O king, they looked highly<br>beautiful, like flights of birds, O monarch, flying away from trees. Then<br>Dhananjaya, having afflicted them thus, with great speed struck hundreds<br>and thousands of them with sharp shafts. And he cut off their heads and<br>also hands with weapons in their grasp, by means of his broad-headed<br>arrows. And he felled on the ground, with his shafts, their thighs,<br>resembling the trunks of elephants. And some were wounded on their backs,<br>arms and eyes. And thus Dhananjaya deprived his foes of diverse limbs,<br>and cars decked and equipped according to rule, and looking like the<br>vapour edifices in the welkin, he cut off into fragments, by means of his<br>arrows, their riders and steeds and elephants. And in many places crowds<br>of cars, whose standards had been cut off, looked like forests of<br>headless palmyras. And elephants with excellent weapons, banners, hooks,<br>and standards fell down like wooded mountains, split with Sakra's<br>thunder. Graced with tails, looking like those of the yak, and covered<br>with coats of mail, and with their entrails and eyes dragged out, steeds<br>along with their riders, rolled on the ground, slain by means of Partha's<br>shafts. No longer holding in their grasp the swords that had served for<br>their nails, with their coats of mail tom, and the joints of their bones<br>broken, foot-soldiers with their vital limbs cut open, helplessly laid<br>themselves down on the field, slain by means of Arjuna's arrows. And the<br>field of battle assumed an awful aspect in consequence of those warriors<br>slain, or in the course of being slaughtered, falling and fallen,<br>standing or in course of being whirled along. And the air was purified of<br>the dust that had arisen, by means of the showers of blood (caused by<br>Arjuna's arrows). And the earth, strewn with hundreds of headless trunks,<br>became impassable. And the car of Vibhatsu in that battle shone fiercely<br>like the car of Rudra himself, while engaged at the end of the Yuga in<br>destroying all creatures. While slaughtered by Partha thus, those<br>warriors, with their steeds and cars and elephants in great distress,<br>ceased not to rush against him; though, deprived of life one after<br>another, they had to become the guests of Sakra. Then the field of<br>battle, O chief of the Bharatas, strewn with mighty car-warriors deprived<br>of life, looked dreadful like Yama's domains, abounding with the spirits<br>of the departed creatures. Meanwhile, when Arjuna was furiously engaged<br>(with the Samsaptakas), Drona, at the head of his forces arrayed for<br>battle, rushed against Yudhishthira, and many warriors, accomplished in<br>smiting and properly arrayed, followed him, actuated by the desire of<br>seizing Yudhishthira. The battle then that ensued became exceedingly<br>fierce.'"
