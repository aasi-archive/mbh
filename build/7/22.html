                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'When the Pandavas were broken by Bharadwaja's son<br>in hat dreadful battle, and the Panchalas also, was there anybody that<br>approached Drona for battle? Alas, beholding Drona stationed in battle,<br>like a, awning tiger, or an elephant with rent temples, ready to lay down<br>his life in battle, well-armed, conversant with all modes of fight, that<br>great bowman, that tiger among men, that enhancer of the fear of foes,<br>grateful, devoted to truth, ever desirous of benefiting<br>Duryodhana,&#8212;alas, beholding him at the head of his troops, was there no<br>man that could approach him, with a laudable determination for battle a<br>determination that enhances the renown of Kshatriyas, that mean-spirited<br>persons can never form, and that is distinctive only of the foremost of<br>persons? Tell me, O Sanjaya, who were those heroes that approached the<br>son of Bharadwaja, beholding him at the head of his forces?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the Panchalas, the Pandavas, the Matsyas, the<br>Srinjayas, the Chedis, the Kalikeyas, thus routed after being broken in<br>battle by Drona with his shafts, beholding them thus driven from the<br>field by those showers of fleet arrows shot from Drona's, bow, like<br>vessels sent adrift by the awful waves of the tempest-tossed ocean, the<br>Kauravas with many leonine shouts and with the noise of diverse<br>instruments, began to assail the cars and elephants and foot-soldiers (of<br>that hostile host) from all sides. And beholding those (fleeting soldiers<br>of the Pandavas) king Duryodhana, stationed in the midst of his own<br>forces and encompassed by his own relatives and kinsmen, filled with joy,<br>and laughing as he spoke, said these words unto Karna.'<br><br>"Duryodhana said, 'Behold, O Radha's son, the Panchalas broken by that<br>firm bowman (Drona) with his shafts, like a herd of the wild deer<br>frightened by a lion. These, I think, will not again come to battle. They<br>have been broken by Drona like mighty trees by the tempest. Afflicted by<br>that high-souled warrior with those shafts winged with gold, they are<br>fleeing away, no two persons are together. Indeed, they seem to be<br>dragged in eddies all over the field. Checked by the Kauravas as also by<br>the high-souled Drona, they are huddling close to one another like (a<br>herd of) elephants in the midst of a conflagration. Like a blossoming<br>trees penetrated by flights of bees, these warriors, pierced with the<br>sharp shafts of Drona, are huddling close to one another, as they are<br>flying away from the field. There, the wrathful Bhima, abandoned by the<br>Pandavas and the Srinjayas, and surrounded by my warriors, delighteth me<br>greatly, O Karna! It is evident, that wicked wight beholdeth the world<br>today to be full of Drona! Without doubt, that son of Pandu hath today<br>become hopeless of life and kingdom.'<br><br>"Karna said, 'That mighty-armed warrior will not certainly abandon the<br>battle as long as he is alive. Nor will he, O tiger among men, brook<br>these leonine shouts (of ours). Nor will the Pandavas, I think, be<br>defeated in battle. They are brave, endued with great might, accomplished<br>in weapons, and difficult of being resisted in battle. Recollecting the<br>woes caused them by our attempts at poisoning and burning them, and the<br>woes that arose from the match at dice, bearing in mind also their exile<br>in, the woods, the Pandavas, I think, will not abandon the fight. The<br>mighty-armed Vrikodara of immeasurable energy hath already turned back<br>(for the fight). The son of Kunti will certainly slay many of our<br>foremost car-warriors. With sword and bow and dart, with steeds and<br>elephants and men and cars,[41] with his mace made of iron, he will slay<br>crowds (of our soldiers). Other car-warriors headed by Satyajit, together<br>with the Panchalas, the Kekayas, the Matsyas, and especially the<br>Pandavas, are following him. They are all brave, and possessed of great<br>might and prowess. Mighty car-warriors, they are again led by Bhima in<br>wrath. Those bulls of the race, surrounding Vrikodara on all sides, like<br>the clouds surrounding the Sun, begin to approach Drona from all sides.<br>Closely intent upon one object, these will certainly afflict unprotected<br>Drona, like flights of insects, on the point of death, striking a blazing<br>lamp. Accomplished in weapons, they are certainly competent to resist<br>Drona. Heavy is the burthen, I think, that now rests on Bharadwaja's son.<br>Let us then quickly go to the spot where Drona is. Let not those slay him<br>of regulated vows like wolves slaying a mighty elephant!'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing these words of Radheya, king Duryodhana<br>then, accompanied by his brothers, O monarch, proceeded towards Drona's<br>car. The noise there was deafening, of Pandava warriors returned to the<br>fight on their cars drawn by excellent steeds of diverse hue,[42] all<br>actuated by the desire of slaying Drona alone.'"
