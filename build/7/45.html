                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'While the youthful and invincible son of Subhadra,<br>never retreating from battle, was, after penetrating into our array,<br>engaged in achieving feats worthy of his lineage, borne by his three-year<br>old steeds of great might and of the best breed, and apparently trotting<br>in the welkin, what heroes of my army encompassed him?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Having penetrated into our array, Abhimanyu of Pandu's<br>race, by means of his sharp shafts, made all the kings turn away from the<br>fight. Then Drona, and Kripa, and Karna, and Drona's son, and Vrihadvala<br>and Kritavarman, the son of Hridika,&#8212;these six<br>car-warriors,&#8212;encompassed him. As regards the other combatants of thy<br>army, beholding that Jayadratha had taken upon himself the heavy duty (of<br>keeping off the Pandavas), they supported him, O king, by rushing against<br>Yudhishthira.[76] Many amongst them, endued with great strength, drawing<br>their bows full six cubits long, showered on the heroic son of Subhadra<br>arrowy downpours like torrents of rain. Subhadra's son, however, that<br>slayer of hostile heroes, paralysed by his shafts all those great bowmen,<br>conversant with every branch of learning. And he pierced Drona with fifty<br>arrows and Vrihadvala with twenty. And piercing Kritavarman with eighty<br>shafts, he pierced Kripa with sixty. And the son of Arjuna pierced<br>Aswatthaman with ten arrows equipped with golden wings, endued with great<br>speed and shot from his bow drawn to its fullest stretch. And the son of<br>Phalguni pierced Karna, in the midst of his foes, in one of his cars,<br>with a bright, well-tempered, and bearded arrow of great force. Felling<br>the steeds yoked to Kripa's car, as also both his Parshni charioteers,<br>Abhimanyu pierced Kripa himself in the centre of the chest with ten<br>arrows. The mighty Abhimanyu, then, in the very sight of thy heroic sons,<br>slew the brave Vrindaraka, that enhancer of the fame of the Kurus. While<br>Abhimanyu was thus engaged in fearlessly slaying one after another the<br>foremost warriors among his enemies, Drona's son Aswatthaman pierced him<br>with five and twenty small arrows. The son of Arjuna, however, in the<br>very sight of all the Dhartarashtras quickly pierced Aswatthaman in<br>return, O sire, with many whetted shafts. Drona's son, however, in<br>return, piercing Abhimanyu. with sixty fierce arrows of great impetuosity<br>and keen sharpness, failed to make him tremble, for the latter, pierced<br>by Aswatthaman, stood immovable like the Mainaka mountain. Endued with<br>great energy, the mighty Abhimanyu then pierced his antagonist with three<br>and seventy straight arrows, equipped with wings of gold. Drona then,<br>desirous of rescuing his son, pierced Abhimanyu with a hundred arrows.<br>And Aswatthaman pierced him with sixty arrows, desirous of rescuing his<br>father. And Karna struck him with two and twenty broad-headed arrows and<br>Kritavarman struck him with four and ten. And Vrihadvala pierced him with<br>fifty such shafts, and Saradwata's son, Kripa, with ten. Abhimanyu,<br>however, pierced each of these in return with ten shafts. The ruler of<br>the Kosala struck Abhimanyu, in the chest with a barbed arrow. Abhimanyu,<br>however, quickly felled on the earth his antagonist's steeds and standard<br>and bow and charioteer. The ruler of the Kosalas, then, thus deprived of<br>his car, took up a sword and wished to sever from Abhimanyu's trunk his<br>beautiful head, decked with ear-rings. Abhimanyu then pierced king<br>Vrihadvala, the ruler of the Kosalas, in the chest, with a strong arrow.<br>The latter then, with riven heart, fell down. Beholding this, ten<br>thousand illustrious kings broke and fled. Those kings, armed with swords<br>and bows, fled away, uttering words inimical (to king Duryodhana's<br>Interest). Having slain[77] Vrihadvala thus, the son of Subhadra careered<br>it battle, paralysing thy warriors,&#8212;-those great bowmen,&#8212;by means of<br>arrowy downpours, thick as rain.'"[78]
