                            "Sthanu said, 'O lord, thou hadst taken great care for creating diverse<br>creatures. Indeed, creatures of diverse kinds were created and reared by<br>thee. Those very creatures, again, are now being consumed through thy<br>fire. Seeing this, I am filled with compassion. O illustrious lord, be<br>inclined to grace.'<br><br>"Brahma said, 'I had no desire of destroying the universe, I desired good<br>of the earth, and it was for this that wrath possessed me. The goddess<br>Earth, afflicted with the heavy weight of creatures, always urged me for<br>destroying the creatures on her. Urged by her, I could not however, find<br>any means for the destruction of the infinite creation. At this wrath<br>possessed me.'<br><br>"Rudra said, 'Be inclined to grace. O lord of the universe, cherish not<br>the wrath for the destruction of creatures. No more let creatures,<br>immobile and mobile, be destroyed. Through thy grace, O illustrious one,<br>let the threefold universe, viz., the Future, the Past, and the Present<br>exist. Thou, O Lord, hadst blazed up with wrath. From that wrath of<br>thine, a substance like fire sprang into existence, That fire is even now<br>blasting rocks and trees and rivers, and all kinds of herbs and grass.<br>Indeed, that fire is exterminating the immobile and the mobile universe.<br>The mobile and the immobile universe is being reduced to ashes. Be<br>inclined to grace, O illustrious one! Do not give way to wrath. Even this<br>is the boon I solicit, All created things, O divine Being, belonging to<br>thee, are being destroyed. Therefore, let thy wrath be appeased. Let it<br>be annihilated in thy own self. Cast thy eye on thy creatures, inspired<br>with the desire of doing them good. Do that by which creatures endued<br>with life may not cease to be. Let not these creatures, with their<br>productive powers weakened be exterminated. O Creator of the worlds, thou<br>hast appointed me their Protector, O Lord of the universe, let not the<br>mobile and the immobile universe to be destroyed. Thou art inclined to<br>grace, and it is for this that I say these words unto thee.'<br><br>"Narada continued, Hearing these words (of Mahadeva) the divine Brahma,<br>from desire of benefiting creatures, held in his own inner self his wrath<br>that had been roused. Extinguishing the fire, the divine Benefactor of<br>the world, the great Master, declared the duties of Production and<br>Emancipation. And while the Supreme Deity exterminated that fire born of<br>his wrath, there came out from the doors of his diverse senses a female<br>who was dark and red and tawny, whose tongue and face and eyes were red,<br>and who was decked with two brilliant ear-rings and diverse other<br>brilliant ornaments. Issuing out of his body, she smilingly looked at<br>those two lords of the universe and then set out for the southern<br>quarter, Then Brahma, that controller of the creation and destruction of<br>the worlds, called after her by the name of Death. And Brahma, O king,<br>said unto her, 'Slay these creatures of mine! Thou hast been born of that<br>wrath of mine which I cherished for the destruction (of the universe). By<br>doing this, kill all creatures including idiots and seers at my command.<br>By doing this, thou wilt be benefited.' Thou lotus-lady, called Death,<br>thus addressed by him reflected deeply, and then helplessly wept aloud in<br>melodious accents. The Grandsire then caught the tears she had shed, with<br>his two hands, for the benefit of all creatures, and began to implore her<br>(with these words).'
