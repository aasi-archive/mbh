                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the grandsire, viz., the venerable Bhishma,<br>that destroyer of all the Kshatriyas, that hero of righteous soul and<br>immeasurable energy, that great bowman thrown down (from his car) by<br>Savyasachin with his celestial weapons, lying on a bed of arrows, and<br>looking like the vast ocean dried up by mighty winds, the hope of thy<br>sons for victory had disappeared along with their coats of mail and peace<br>of mind. Beholding him who was always an island unto persons sinking in<br>the fathomless ocean in their endeavours to cross it, beholding that hero<br>covered with arrows that had coursed in a stream as continuous as that of<br>Yamuna, that hero who looked like Mainaka of unbearable energy thrown<br>down on the earth by the great Indra, that warrior lying prostrate on the<br>earth like the Sun dropped down from the firmament, that one who looked<br>like the inconceivable Indra himself after his defeat of old by Vritra,<br>that depriver of all warriors of their senses, that foremost of all<br>combatants, that signal of all bowmen, beholding that hero and bull among<br>men, viz., thy sire Bhishma of high vows, that grandsire of the Bharatas<br>thrown down in battle and lying covered with Arjuna's shafts, on a hero's<br>bed. Adhiratha's son (Karna) alighted from his car, in great affliction,<br>filled with grief, and almost senseless. Afflicted (with sorrow), and<br>with eyes troubled with tears, he proceeded on foot. Saluting him with<br>joined palms, and addressing him reverentially, he said, 'I am Karna!<br>Blessed be thou! Speak to me, O Bharata, in sacred and auspicious words,<br>and look at me, opening thy eyes. No man certainly enjoyeth in this world<br>the fruits of his pious deeds, since thou, reverend in years and devoted<br>to virtue, liest slain on the ground. O thou that art the foremost one<br>amongst the Kurus, I do not see that there is any one else among them,<br>who is competent (like thee) in filling the treasury, in counsels, in the<br>matter of disposing the troops in battle array, and in the use of<br>weapons, Alas, he that was endued with a righteous understanding, he that<br>always protected the Kurus from every danger, alas, he, having slain<br>numberless warriors, proceedeth to the region of the Pitris. From this<br>day, O chief of the Bharatas, the Pandavas, excited with wrath, will<br>slaughter the Kurus like tigers slaying deer. Today the Kauravas,<br>acquainted with the force of Gandiva's twang, will regard Savyasachin,<br>like the Asuras regarding the wielder of the thunder-bolt, with terror.<br>Today the noise, resembling that of heaven's thunder, of the arrows shot<br>from Gandiva, will inspire the Kurus and other kings with great terror.<br>Today, O hero, like a raging conflagration of fierce flames consuming a<br>forest, the shafts of Kiritin will consume the Dhartarashtras. In those<br>parts of the forest through which fire and wind march together, they burn<br>all plants and creepers and trees. Without doubt, Partha is even like a<br>surging fire, and, without doubt, O tiger among men, Krishna is like the<br>wind. Hearing the blare of Panchajanya and the twang of Gandiva all the<br>Kaurava troops, O Bharata, will be filled with fear. O hero, without<br>thee, the kings will never be able to bear the rattle of the ape-bannered<br>car belonging to that grinder of foes, when he will advance (upon them).<br>Who amongst the kings, save thyself, is competent to battle with that<br>Arjuna whose feats, as described by the wise, are all superhuman?<br>Superhuman was the battle that he fought with the high-souled (Mahadeva)<br>of three eyes. From him he obtained a boon that is unattainable by<br>persons of unsanctified souls. Delighted in battle, that son of Pandu is<br>protected by Madhava. Who is there that is competent to vanquish him who<br>could not be vanquished by thee before, although thou, endued with great<br>energy, hadst vanquished Rama himself in battle, that fierce destroyer of<br>the Kshatriya race, worshipped, besides, by the gods and the Danavas?<br>Incapable of putting up with that son of Pandu, that foremost of heroes<br>in battle, even I, with thy permission, am competent to slay, with the<br>force of my weapons, that brave and fierce warrior who resembleth a snake<br>of virulent poison and who slayeth his foes with his glances alone!'"
