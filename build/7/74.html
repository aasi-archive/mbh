                            "Sanjaya said, 'When the spies (of Duryodhana), having heard that loud<br>uproar made by the Pandavas desirous of victory, informed (their masters<br>of the cause), Jayadratha, overwhelmed with sorrow, and with heart<br>stupefied with grief, and like one sinking in a fathomless ocean of<br>distress, slowly rose up and having reflected for a long while, proceeded<br>to the assembly of the kings. Reflecting for a while in the presence of<br>those gods among men, Jayadratha, in fear of Abhimanyu's father and<br>covered with shame, said these words&#8212;He who in Pandu's soil was begotten<br>by Indra under the influence of desire, that wicked wretch is thinking of<br>despatching me to the abode of Yama! Blessed be ye, I shall, therefore go<br>back to my home from desire of life! Or, ye bulls among Kshatriyas,<br>protect me by the force of your weapons! Partha seeks to slay me, ye<br>heroes, render me fearless! Drona and Duryodhana and Kripa, and Karna,<br>and the ruler of the Madras, and Valhika, and Dussasana and others, are<br>capable of protecting a person who is afflicted by Yama himself. When<br>however, I am threatened by Phalguna alone, will not all these the lords<br>of earth, will not all of you, joined together, be able to protect me?<br>Having heard the shouts of joy of the Pandavas, great hath been my fear.<br>My limbs, ye lords of earth, have become powerless like those of a person<br>on the point of death? Without doubt, the wielder of Gandiva hath sworn<br>for my death! It is for this that the Pandavas are shouting in joy at a<br>time when they should weep! Let alone the rulers of men, the very gods<br>and Gandharvas, the Asuras, the Uragas, and the Rakshasas, cannot venture<br>to baffle a vow of Arjuna. Therefore, ye bulls among men, blessed be ye,<br>give me permission (to leave the Kuru camp). I want to make myself<br>scarce. The Pandavas will no longer be able to find me! While indulging<br>in such lamentations, with heart agitated by fear, king Duryodhana,<br>always looking upon the accomplishment of his own business to be<br>preferable to everything else, said unto him these words-Do not fear, O<br>tiger among men! O bull among men, who will seek to encounter thee in<br>battle when thou will remain in the midst of these Kshatriya heroes!<br>Myself, Vikartana's son, Karna, Chitrasena, Vivinsati, Bhurisravas, Sala,<br>Salya, the invincible Vrishasena, Purumitra, Jaya, Bhoja, Sudakshina the<br>ruler of the Kamvojas, Satyavrata, the mighty-armed, Vikarna, Durmukha,<br>Dussasana, Subahu, the ruler of the Kalingas, with his weapons upraised,<br>Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti, Drona, Drona's son, and Suvala's son<br>(Sakuni),&#8212;these and numerous other kings will, with their forces, face<br>the battle surrounding thee on all sides! Let the fever of thy heart,<br>therefore, be dispelled! Thou art thyself one of the foremost of<br>car-warriors! O thou of immeasurable splendour, thou thyself art a hero!<br>Being what thou art how canst thou then see any cause of fear, O king of<br>the Sindhus! The eleven Akshauhinis of troops I own will carefully fight<br>for protecting thee! Therefore, do not fear, O king of the Sindhus! Let<br>thy fears be dispelled!'<br><br>'Sanjaya continued, 'Thus comforted, O monarch, by thy son, the king of<br>the Sindhus then, accompanied by Duryodhana, repaired that very night to<br>Drona (the generalissimo of the Kuru army). Then, O king, having touched<br>Drona's feet with reverence, and taken his seat with humility, he asked<br>the preceptor these words&#8212;In hitting the aim, in hitting it from it<br>distance, in tightness of hand, and in the force of the stroke, O<br>illustrious one, tell the difference between myself and Phalguna! O<br>preceptor, I wish to know accurately the difference as regards<br>proficiency (in the science of arms) between myself and Arjuna! Say it<br>unto me truly'<br><br>"Drona said, 'Of tutorial instruction, both of you, i.e., thyself and<br>Arjuna, have had the same measure, O son! In consequence, however, of<br>yoga and the hard life led by Arjuna, he is superior to thee! Thou<br>shouldst not, however, for any reason, cherish fear of Partha! Without<br>doubt, I will, O son, protect thee from this fear! The very gods, cannot<br>prevail over him who is protected by my arms! I will form an array which<br>Partha will not succeed in piercing![127] Therefore contained thou in<br>battle, do not fear, observing the duties of thy own order! O mighty<br>car-warrior, tread in the track of thy sires and grandsires! Having duly<br>studied the Vedas, thou hast poured libations, according to the<br>ordinance, into fire! Thou hast also performed many sacrifices: Death<br>cannot, therefore, be an object of terror to thee! (For if thou diest),<br>attaining then to that great good fortune which is unattainable by vile<br>men, thou will acquire all those excellent regions in heaven that are<br>attainable by the might of one's arms! The Kaurvas, the Pandavas, the<br>Vrishnis, and other men, as also myself with my son, are all mortal and<br>short-lived! Think of this. One after another, all of us, slain by Time<br>which is all powerful, shall go to the other world, carrying with us only<br>our respective deeds I Those regions that ascetics acquire by undergoing<br>severe penances, those regions are acquired by heroic Kshatriyas that are<br>observant of the duties of their order. Even thus was the ruler of the<br>Sindhus consoled by Bharadwaja's son. Banishing his fear of Partha, he<br>set his heart on battle. Then, O king thy troops also felt great delight,<br>and the loud sounds of musical instruments were heard, mingled with<br>leonine shouts.'"
