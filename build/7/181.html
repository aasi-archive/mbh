                            "Arjuna said, 'How, O Janardana, for our good, and by what means, were<br>those lords of the earth, viz., Jarasandha and the others, slain?'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, If Jarasandha, and the ruler of the Chedis, and the<br>mighty son of the Nishada king, had not been slain, they would have<br>become terrible. Without doubt, Duryodhana would have chosen those<br>foremost of car-warriors (for embracing his side). They had always been<br>hostile to us, and, accordingly, they would all have adopted the side of<br>the Kauravas. All of them were heroes and mighty bowmen accomplished in<br>weapons and firm in battle. Like the celestials (in prowess), they would<br>have protected Dhritarashtra's sons. Indeed, the Suta's son, and<br>Jarasandha, and the ruler of the Chedis, and the son of the Nishada<br>adopting the son of Suyodhana, would have succeeded in conquering the<br>whole earth. Listen, O Dhananjaya, by what means they were slain. Indeed,<br>without the employment of means, the very gods could not have conquered<br>them in battle. Each of them, O Partha, could fight in battle with the<br>whole celestial host protected by the Regents of the world. (On one<br>occasion), assailed by Valadeva, Jarasandha, excited with wrath, hurled<br>for our destruction a mace capable of slaying all creatures. Endued with<br>the splendour of fire, that mace coursed towards us dividing the welkin<br>like the line on the head that parts the tresses of a woman, and with the<br>impetuosity of the thunder hurled by Sakra. Beholding that mace thus<br>coursing towards us the son of Rohini hurled the weapon called<br>Sthunakarna for baffling it. Its force destroyed by the energy of<br>Valadeva's weapon, that mace fell down on the earth, splitting her (with<br>its might) and making the very mountains tremble. There was a terrible<br>Rakshasa of the name Jara, endued with great prowess. She, O prince, had<br>united that slayer of foes, and, therefore, was the latter called<br>Jarasandha. Jarasandha had been made up of two halves of one child. And<br>because it was Jara that had united those two halves, it was for this<br>that he came to be called Jarasandha.[237] That Rakshasa woman, O Partha,<br>who was there within the earth, was slain with her son and kinsmen by<br>means-of that mace and the weapon of Sthunakarna. Deprived of his mace in<br>that great battle, Jarasandha was afterwards slain by Bhimasena in thy<br>presence, O Dhananjaya.[238] If the valiant Jarasandha had stood armed<br>with his mace, the very gods with Indra at their head could not have<br>slain him in battle. O best of men! for thy good, the Nishada's son also,<br>of prowess incapable of being baffled, was, by an act of guile, deprived<br>of his thumb by Drona, assuming the position of his preceptor. Proud and<br>endued with steady prowess, the Nishada's son, with fingers cased in<br>leathern gloves, looked resplendent like a second Rama. Undeprived of<br>thumb, Ekalavya, O Partha, was incapable of being vanquished in battle by<br>the gods, the Danavas, the Rakshasas, and the Uragas (together). Of firm<br>grasp, accomplished in weapons, and capable of shooting incessantly day<br>and night, he was incapable of being looked at by mere men. For thy good,<br>he was slain by me on the field of battle. Endued with great prowess, the<br>ruler of the Chedis was slain by me before thy eyes. He also was<br>incapable of being vanquished in battle by the gods and the Asuras<br>together. I was born to slay him as also the other enemies of the gods,<br>with thy assistance, O tiger among men, from desire of benefiting the<br>world. Hidimva and Vaka and Kirmira have all been slain by Bhimasena. All<br>those Rakshasas were endued with might equal to that Ravana and all of<br>them were destroyers of Brahmanas and sacrifices. Similarly, Alayudha,<br>possessed of large powers of illusion, had been slain by Hidimva's son.<br>Hidimva's son also, I have slain by the employment of means, viz.,<br>through Karna with his dart. If Karna had not slain him with his dart in<br>great battle, I myself would have had to slay Bhima's son Ghatotkacha.<br>From desire of benefiting you, I did not slay him before. That Rakshasa<br>was inimical to Brahmanas and sacrifices. Because he was a destroyer of<br>sacrifices and of a sinful soul, therefore hath he been thus slain. O<br>sinless one, by that act as a means, the dart given by Sakra, hath also<br>been rendered futile. O son of Pandu, they that are destroyers of<br>righteousness are all slayable by me. Even that is the vow made by me,<br>for establishing righteousness. Whither the Vedas and truth and<br>self-restraint and purity and righteousness and modesty and prosperity<br>and wisdom and forgiveness are always to be met with, thither I myself<br>always remain. Thou needst not be at all anxious about Karna's slaughter.<br>I will tell you the means by which you will slay him. Vrikodara also will<br>succeed in slaying Suyodhana. I will tell thee, O son of Pandu, the means<br>by which that will have to be compassed. Meanwhile, the uproar made by<br>the hostile army is increasing. Thy troops also are flying away on all<br>sides. Having achieved their objects, the Kauravas are destroying thy<br>host. Indeed, Drona, that foremost of all smiters, is scorching us in<br>battle.'"
