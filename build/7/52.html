                            "Narada said, 'The helpless lady, suppressing her arrow within her own<br>self, addressed, with joined hands, the Lord of the creation, bending<br>with humility like a creeper. And she said, O foremost of speakers,<br>created by thee how shall I, being a female, do such a cruel and evil act<br>knowing it to be cruel and evil? I fear unrighteousness greatly. O divine<br>Lord, be inclined to grace. Sons and friends and brothers and sires and<br>husbands are always dear; (if I kill them), they who will suffer these<br>losses will seek to injure me. It is this that I fear. The tears that<br>will fall from the eyes of woe-stricken and weeping persons, inspire me<br>with fear, O Lord! I seek thy protection. O divine Being, O foremost of<br>gods, I will not go to Yama's abode. O boon-giving one, I implore thee or<br>thy grace, bowing my head and joining my palms. O grandsire of the<br>worlds, I solicit (the accomplishment of even) this wish at thy<br>hands![84] I desire, with thy permission, to undergo ascetic penances, O<br>Lord of created things! Grant me this boon, O divine Being, O great<br>master! Permitted by thee, I will go to the excellent asylum of Dhenuka!<br>Engaged in adoring Thyself, I will undergo the severest austerities<br>there. I will not be able, O Lord of the gods, to take away the dear<br>life-breaths of living creatures weeping in sorrow. Protect me from<br>unrighteousness.'<br><br>"Brahma said, 'O Death, thou hast been intended for achieving the<br>destruction of creatures. Go, destroy all creatures, thou needst have no<br>scruples. Even this must be. It cannot be otherwise. Do but my behest.<br>Nobody in the world will find any fault in thee.'<br><br>"Narada continued, 'Thus addressed, that lady became very much<br>affrighted.[85] Looking at Brahma's face, she stood with joined hands.<br>From desire of doing good to creatures, she did not set her heart upon<br>their destruction. The divine Brahma also, that Lord of the lord of all<br>creatures, remained silent. And soon the Grandsire became gratified in<br>his own self. And casting his eyes upon all the creation he smiled. And,<br>thereupon, creatures continued to live as before i.e., unaffected by<br>premature death. And upon that, invincible and illustrious Lord having<br>shaken off his wrath, that damsel left the presence of that wise Deity.<br>Leaving Brahma, without having agreed to destroy creatures, the damsel<br>called Death speedily proceeded to the retreat called Dhenuka. Arrived<br>there, she practised excellent and highly austere vows. And she stood<br>there on one leg for sixteen billions of years, and five times ten<br>billions also, through pity for living creatures and from desire of doing<br>them good, and all the time restraining her senses from their favourite<br>objects. And once again, O king she stood there on one leg for one and<br>twenty times ten billions of years. And then she wandered for ten times<br>ten thousand billions of years with the creatures (of the earth), Next,<br>repairing to the sacred Nanda that was full of cool and pure water, she<br>passed in those waters eight thousand years. Observing rigid vows at<br>Nanda, she cleansed herself of all her sins. Then she proceeded, first of<br>all, to the sacred Kausiki, observant of vow. Living upon air and water<br>only, she practised austerities there, Repairing then to Panchaganga and<br>next to Vetasa, that cleansed damsel, by diverse kinds of especial<br>austerities, emaciated her own body. Going next to the Ganga and thence<br>to the great Meru, she remained motionless like a stone, suspending her<br>life-breath. Thence going to the top of Himavat, where the gods had<br>performed their sacrifice (in days of yore), that amiable and auspicious<br>girl remained for a billion of years standing on the toe only of her<br>feet. Wending then to Pushkara, and Gokarna, and Naimisha, and Malaya,<br>she emaciated her body, practising austerities agreeable to her heart.<br>Without acknowledging any other god, with steady devotion to the<br>Grandsire, she lived and gratified the Grandsire in every way. Then the<br>unchangeable Creator of the worlds, gratified said unto her, with a<br>softened and delighted heart. 'O Death, why dost thou undergo ascetic<br>austerities so severe?' Thus addressed, Death said unto the divine<br>Grandsire, 'Creatures, O Lord, are living in health. They do not injure<br>one another even by words. I shall not be able to slay them. O Lord, I<br>desire even this boon at thy hands. I fear sin, and it is for this that I<br>am engaged in ascetic austerities. O blessed one, undertake to remove for<br>ever my fears. I am a woman, in distress, and without fault. I beg thee,<br>be thou protector. Unto her the divine Brahman acquainted with the past,<br>the present and the future, said, 'Thou shalt commit no sin, O Death, by<br>slaying these creatures. My words can never be futile., O amiable one!<br>Therefore, O auspicious damsel, slay these creatures of four kinds.<br>Eternal virtue shall always be thine. That Regent of the world, viz.,<br>Yama, and the diverse disease shall become thy helpmates. I myself and<br>all the gods will grant thee boons, so that, freed from sin and perfectly<br>cleansed, thou mayst even acquire glory.' Thus addressed, O monarch, that<br>lady, joining her hands, once more said these words, seeking her grace by<br>bowing down unto him with her head, If, O Lord, this is not to be without<br>me, then thy command I place upon my head. Listen, however, to what I<br>say, Let covetousness, wrath, malice, jealousy, quarrel, folly and<br>shamelessness, and other stern passions tear the bodies of all embodied<br>creatures.'<br><br>"Brahman said, 'It will be, O Death, as thou sayest. Meanwhile, slay<br>creatures duly. Sin shall not be thine, nor shall I seek to injure thee,<br>O auspicious one. Those tear-drops of thine that are in my hands, even<br>they will become diseases, springing from living creatures themselves.<br>They will kill men; and if men are killed, sin shall not be thine.<br>Therefore, do not fear, Indeed, sin shall not be thine. Devoted to<br>righteousness, and observant of thy duty, thou shalt sway (all<br>creatures). Therefore, take thou always the fives of these living<br>creatures. Casting off both desire and wrath, take thou the life of all<br>living creatures. Even thus will eternal virtue be thine. Sin will stay<br>those that are of wicked behaviour. By doing my bidding cleanse thyself.<br>It will be thine to sink them in their sins that are wicked. Therefore,<br>cast off both desire and wrath, and kill these creatures endued with<br>life.'<br><br>"Narada continued, 'That damsel, seeing that she was (persistently)<br>called by the name of Death, feared (to act otherwise). And in terror<br>also of Brahma's curse, she said, 'Yes!' Unable to do otherwise, she<br>began, casting off desire and wrath, to take the lives of living<br>creatures when the time came (for their dissolution). It is only living<br>creatures that die. Diseases spring from living creatures themselves.<br>Disease is the abnormal condition of creatures. They are pained by it.<br>Therefore, indulge not in fruitless grief for creatures after they are<br>dead. The senses, upon the death of creatures, go with the latter (to the<br>other world), and achieving their (respective) functions, once more come<br>back (with creatures when the latter are reborn). Thus all creatures, O<br>lion among beings, the very gods included going, thither, have to act,<br>like mortals.[86] The wind, that is awful, of terrible roars and great<br>strength, omnipresent and endued with infinite energy, it is the wind<br>that will rive the bodies of living creatures. It will, in this matter<br>put forth no active energy, nor will it suspend its functions; (but do<br>this naturally). Even all the gods have the appellation of mortals<br>attached to them. Therefore, O lion among kings, do not grieve for thy<br>son! Repairing to heaven, the son of thy body is passing his days in<br>perpetual happiness, having obtained those delightful regions that are<br>for heroes. Casting off all sorrows, he hath attained to the<br>companionship of the righteous. Death hath been ordained by the Creator<br>himself for all creatures! When their hour comes, creatures are destroyed<br>duly. The death of creatures arises from the creatures themselves.<br>Creatures kill themselves. Death doth not kill any one, armed with her<br>bludgeon! Therefore, they that are wise, truly knowing death to be<br>inevitable, because ordained by Brahma himself, never grieve for<br>creatures that are dead. Knowing this death to be ordained by the Supreme<br>God, cast off, without delay; thy grief for thy dead son!'<br><br>"Vyasa continued, 'Hearing these words of grave import spoken by Narada,<br>king Akampana, addressing his friend, said, 'O illustrious one, O<br>foremost of Rishi, my grief is gone, and I am contented. Hearing this<br>history from thee, I am grateful to thee and I worship thee.' That<br>foremost of superior Rishi, that celestial ascetic of immeasurable soul,<br>thus addressed by the king, proceeded to the woods of Nandava. The<br>frequent recital of this history for the hearing of others, as also the<br>frequent hearing of this history, is regarded as cleansing, leading to<br>fame and heaven and worthy of approbation. It enhanceth besides, the<br>period of life. Having listened to this instructive story, cast off thy<br>grief, O Yudhishthira, reflecting besides or, the duties of a Kshatriya<br>and the high state (of blessedness) attainable by heroes. Abhimanyu, that<br>mighty car-warrior, endued with mighty energy, having slain (numerous)<br>foes before the gaze of all bowmen, hath attained to heaven. The great<br>bowman, that mighty car-warrior, struggling on the field, hath fallen in<br>the battle struck with sword and mace and dart, and bow. Sprung from<br>Soma, he hath disappeared in the lunar essence, cleansed of all his<br>impurities. Therefore, O son of Pandu, mustering all thy fortitude.<br>thyself with thy brothers, without allowing your senses to be stupefied<br>speedily set out, inflamed with rage, for battle.'"[87]
