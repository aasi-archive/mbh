                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding Alayudha of terrible deeds come to battle, all<br>the Kauravas became filled with delight. Similarly, thy sons having<br>Duryodhana for their head, (were filled with delight) like raftless men<br>desirous of crossing the ocean when they meet with a raft. Indeed, the<br>Icings in the Kuru army then regarded themselves as persons reborn after<br>death.[236] They all offered a respectful welcome to Alayudha, During the<br>progress of that terrible and superhuman battle between Karna and the<br>Rakshasa at night,&#8212;a battle which though fierce was yet delightful to<br>behold,&#8212;the Panchalas, with all the other Kshatriyas, smilingly looked<br>on as spectators. Meanwhile, thy soldiers, O king, though protected (by<br>their leaders) all over the field and Drona and Drona's son and Kripa and<br>others, uttered loud wails, saying, 'All is lost!' Indeed, beholding<br>those feats of Hidimva's son on the field of battle, all thy warriors<br>were agitated with fear, and uttering cries of woe became almost deprived<br>of their senses. Thy troops, O king, became hopeless of Karna's life.<br>Then Duryodhana, beholding Karna fallen into great distress, summoned<br>Alayudha and said unto him, 'Yonder Vikartana's son, Karna, is engaged<br>with the son of Hidimva, and is accomplishing such feats in battle as are<br>worthy of his might and prowess. Behold those brave kings slain by the<br>son of Bhimasena, struck with diverse kinds of weapons (and lying on the<br>field) like trees broken by an elephant. Amongst all my royal warriors,<br>let this be thy share in battle, allotted by me, with thy permission, O<br>hero, displaying thy prowess, slay thou this Rakshasa. O crusher of foes,<br>see that this wretch viz., Ghatotkacha, may not, relying on his powers of<br>illusion, slay Karna, the son of Vikarana, before thou finishest him.'<br>Thus addressed by the king, that Rakshasa of fierce prowess and mighty<br>arms, saying, 'So be it,' rushed against Ghatotkacha. Then Bhimasena's<br>son, O lord, abandoning Karna, began to grind his advancing foe with<br>arrows. The battle that took place then between those angry Rakshasa<br>princes, resembled that between two infuriated elephants in the forest,<br>fighting for the sake of the same she-elephant in her season. Freed then<br>from the Rakshasa, Karna, that foremost of car-warriors, rushed against<br>Bhimasena, riding on his car of solar effulgence. Beholding Ghatotkacha<br>engaged with Alayudha in battle and afflicted like the leader of a bovine<br>herd when engaged with a lion, Bhima, that foremost of smiters,<br>disregarding the advancing Karna, rushed towards Alayudha, riding on his<br>car of solar effulgence and scattering clouds of shafts. Seeing Bhima<br>advance, Alayudha, O lord, abandoning Ghatotkacha, proceeded against<br>Bhima himself. Then Bhima, that exterminator of Rakshasas, impetuously<br>rushed towards him, O lord, and covered that prince of the Rakshasas with<br>shafts. Similarly, Alayudha, that chastiser of foes, repeatedly covered<br>the son of Kunti with straight shafts whetted on stone. All the other<br>Rakshasas also, of terrible forms and armed with diverse weapons<br>solicitous for the victory of thy sons, rushed against Bhimasena. The<br>mighty Bhimasena, thus assailed by them, pierced each of them with five<br>whetted shafts. Then those Rakshasas of wicked understanding, thus<br>received by Bhimasena, uttered loud wails and fled away on all sides. The<br>mighty Rakshasa, beholding his followers frightened by Bhima, rushed<br>impetuously against Bhima and covered him with shafts. Then Bhimasena, in<br>that battle, weakened his foe by means of many keen-pointed arrows.<br>Amongst those arrows sped at him by Bhima, Alayudha speedily cut off some<br>and seized others in that battle. Then Bhima of terrible prowess, looking<br>steadily at that prince of the Rakshasas, hurled at him with great force<br>a mace endued with the impetuosity of thunder. That mace, coursed towards<br>him like a flame of fire, and the cannibal struck it with a mace of his<br>own, where-upon the latter (baffling the former) proceeded towards Bhima.<br>Then, the son of Kunti covered that prince of Rakshasas, with showers of<br>shafts. The Rakshasa, with his own keen shafts, baffled all those shafts<br>of Bhima. Then all those Rakshasa warriors, of terrible forms, rallying<br>and returning to battle, at the command of their leader, began to slay<br>the elephants (of Bhima's force). The Panchalas and the Srinjayas, the<br>steeds and huge elephants (of Bhima's army), exceedingly afflicted by the<br>Rakshasas, became much agitated. Beholding that terrible battle (fought<br>between Bhima and the Rakshasa), Vasudeva, that foremost of men<br>addressing Dhananjaya, said these words, 'Behold, the mighty-armed Bhima<br>is succumbing to that prince of Rakshasas. Quickly proceed in Bhima's<br>wake, without thinking of anything else, O son of Pandu. Meanwhile, let<br>Dhrishtadyumna and Sikhandin, and Yudhamanyu and Uttamaujas, these mighty<br>car-warriors, uniting with the son of Draupadi, proceed against Karna.<br>Let Nakula and Sahadeva and the valiant Yuyudhana, O son of Pandu, at thy<br>command, slay the other Rakshasas! As regards thyself, O mighty armed<br>one, do thou resist this division having Drona at its head. O thou of<br>mighty arms, great is the danger that threatens us now.' After Krishna<br>had said so, those foremost of car-warriors, as commanded, proceeded<br>against Karna, the son of Vikartana, and against the other Rakshasas<br>(fighting for the Kurus). Then with some shafts resembling snakes of<br>virulent poison and sped from his bow drawn to its fullest stretch, the<br>valiant prince of the Rakshasas cut off Bhima's bow. The mighty cannibal<br>next, in the very sight of Bhima, O Bharata, slew the latter's steeds and<br>driver with some whetted shafts. Steedless and driverless, Bhima,<br>descending from the terrace of his car, uttered a loud roar and hurled a<br>heavy mace at his foe. That heavy mace, as it coursed impetuously towards<br>him with a terrible sound, the mighty cannibal baffled with a mace of his<br>own. The latter then uttered a loud roar. Beholding that mighty and<br>terrible feat of that prince of Rakshasas, Bhimasena filled with joy,<br>seized another fierce mace. The battle then that took place between that<br>human warrior and that Rakshasa, became dreadful. With the clash of their<br>descending maces, the earth trembled violently. Casting aside their<br>maces, they once more encountered each other. They struck each other with<br>their clenched fists, failing with the sound of thunder. Excited with<br>rage, they encountered each other with car-wheels, and yokes, and Akshas<br>and Adhishthanas, and Upaskaras, in fact, with anything that came in<br>their way. Encountering each other thus and both covered with blood, they<br>looked like a couple of infuriated elephants of gigantic size. Then,<br>Hrishikesa, ever devoted to the good of the Pandavas, beholding that<br>combat, despatched Hidimva's son for protecting Bhimasena.'"
