                            "Sanjaya said, 'Thus urged by Drona, king Duryodhana, filled with rage<br>set his heart on battle. And thy son, Duryodhana, then said unto Karna,<br>'Behold, the diadem-decked son of Pandu, with Krishna alone for helpmate,<br>penetrated into the array formed by the preceptor, an array that the gods<br>themselves could not pierce, and in the very sight of the illustrious<br>Drona struggling in battle and of many other foremost of warriors, slew<br>the ruler of the Sindhus. Behold, O son of Radha, many foremost of kings<br>lying on the earth, slain in battle. Partha unaided by any one, in the<br>very sight of the illustrious Drona and myself, vigorously exerting<br>ourselves like a host of inferior animals-slain by a lion. The son of<br>Sakra hath reduced my host to a small remnant of what it was. How,<br>indeed, could Phalguna, in spite of the resistance offered by Drona in<br>battle, accomplish his vow by slaying the ruler of the Sindhus? If Drona<br>had not himself willed it, O hero, how could the son of Pandu, in battle,<br>have pierced that impenetrable array, overcoming his struggling<br>preceptor? Truly, Phalguna is exceedingly dear to the illustrious<br>preceptor! For this, the latter gave him admittance, without having<br>fought with him. Behold my misfortune! Having in the first instance<br>promised protection unto the ruler of the Sindhus, Drona, that scorcher<br>of foes, gave unto the diadem-decked Arjuna admittance into the array! If<br>he had in the beginning granted permission to the ruler of the Sindhus<br>for his return home, without doubt, such an awful carnage would then have<br>never occurred. Alas! Jayadratha, in hopes of saving his life, had<br>desired to return home. Having obtained from Drona a promise of<br>protection in battle, it was I, a fool that I was, who prevented him from<br>going. Alas, today my brothers having Chitrasena for their head, have all<br>perished in the very sight of our wretched selves.'[187]<br><br>"Karna said, 'Do not blame the preceptor. That Brahmana is fighting<br>according to the measure of his power and courage and regardless of his<br>very life. If Arjuna, of white steeds, having transgressed him,<br>penetrated into our array, the slightest fault does not, for that, attach<br>to the preceptor. Phalguna is accomplished in weapons, possessed of great<br>activity, endued with youth; he is a hero who has mastered all arms; he<br>is distinguished for the celerity of his movements. Armed with celestial<br>weapons and mounted on his ape-bannered car, the reins of whose steeds<br>again were in the hands of Krishna, cased in impenetrable armour, and<br>taking his celestial bow Gandiva of unfading might, the valiant Arjuna,<br>scattering keen arrows, and proud of the strength of his arms,<br>transgressed Drona. There is nothing to wonder at this. The preceptor, on<br>the other hand is, O king, old and incapable of proceeding quickly. He is<br>also, O king, incapable of exercising his arms long. It was for this that<br>Phalguna, of white steeds and having Krishna for his charioteer,<br>succeeded in transgressing the preceptor. For this reason also, I do not<br>see any fault in Drona. For all that, when Arjuna, of white steeds,<br>penetrated into our array, having transgressed the preceptor it seems<br>that the latter, however skilled in weapons, is incapable of vanquishing<br>the Pandavas in battle. I think that which is ordained by Fate never<br>occurs otherwise. And since, O Suyodhana, in spite of ourselves fighting<br>to the utmost extent of our powers, the ruler of the Sindhus has been<br>slain in battle, it seems that Fate is all-powerful. With thyself we had<br>all been exerting to the utmost of our might on the field of battle.<br>Fate, however, baffling our exertions, did not smile on us. We have<br>always exerted to injure the Pandavas, relying both on deceit and<br>prowess. Whatever act, O king, a person afflicted by Fate does, is<br>frustrated by Fate, however, much the person himself may strive to<br>achieve it. Whatever, indeed, a man endued with perseverance should do,<br>ought to be done fearlessly. Success depends on Fate! By deceit the sons<br>of Pritha were beguiled as also by the administration of poison, O<br>Bharata! Burnt they were in the palace of lac, vanquished they were at<br>dice. In accordance with the dictates of statecraft, they were exited<br>into the woods. All these, though done by us with care, have been baffled<br>by Fate. Fight with resolution, O king, setting Fate at nought. Between<br>thee and them, both striving to the best of your prowess even Fate may<br>prove auspicious to that party which excels the other.[188] No wise<br>measures have been adopted by the Pandavas with the aid of superior<br>intelligence. Nor, O hero, do we see, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, that<br>thou hast done anything unwise from want of intelligence! It is Fate that<br>decides the result of acts, wise or unwise; Fate, ever intent on its own<br>purposes is awake when all else sleeps. Vast was thy host, and thy<br>warriors are many. Even thus the battle began. With their small force,<br>much greater and consisting of men capable of smiting effectually, hath<br>been much reduced. I fear, it is the work of Fate, that has frustrated<br>our exertions.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'While they were discoursing thus, O king, the<br>Pandava divisions appeared for battle. Then occurred a fierce battle<br>between thy warriors and theirs, in which cars and elephants encountered<br>one another. All this, however, O king, was due to thy evil policy!'"
