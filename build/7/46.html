                            "Sanjaya said, 'Phalguni's son once more pierced Karna in the car with a<br>barbed arrow, and for angering him still further, he pierced him with<br>fifty other shafts. The son of Radha pierced Abhimanyu in return with as<br>many shafts. Covered all over with arrows, Abhimanyu, then, O sire,<br>looked exceedingly beautiful. Filled with rage, he caused Karna also to<br>be bathed in blood. Mangled with arrows and covered with blood, the brave<br>Karna also shone greatly.[79] Both of them pierced with arrows, both<br>bathed in blood, those illustrious warriors then resembled a couple of<br>flowering Kinsukas. The son of Subhadra then slew six of Karna's brave<br>counsellors, conversant with all modes of warfare, with their steeds and<br>charioteers and cars. As regards other great bowmen Abhimanyu fearlessly<br>pierced each of them in return, with ten arrows. That feat of his seemed<br>highly wonderful. Slaying next the son of the ruler of the Magadhas,<br>Abhimanyu, with six straight shafts, slew the youthful Aswaketu with his<br>four steeds and charioteer. Then slaying, with a sharp razor-headed<br>arrow, the Bhoja prince of Martikavata, bearing the device of an elephant<br>(on his banner), the son of Arjuna uttered a loud shout and began to<br>scatter his shafts on all sides. Then the son of Duhsasana pierced the<br>four steeds of Abhimanyu with four shafts, his charioteer with one and<br>Abhimanyu himself with ten. The son of Arjuna, then, piercing Duhsasana's<br>son with ten fleet shafts, addressed him in a loud tone and with eyes red<br>in wrath, said, 'Abandoning the battle, thy sire hath fled like a coward.<br>It is well thou knowest how to fight. Thou shalt not, however, escape<br>today with life.' Saying these words unto him, Abhimanyu sped a long<br>arrow, well polished by smith's hand, at his foe. The son of Drona cut<br>that arrow with three shafts of his own. Leaving Aswatthaman alone,<br>Arjuna's son struck Salya, in return, fearlessly pierced him in the chest<br>with highly nine shafts, equipped with vulture's feathers. That feat<br>seemed highly wonderful. The son of Arjuna then cut off Salya's bow and<br>slew both his Parshni charioteers. Abhimanyu then pierced Salya himself<br>with six shafts made wholly of iron. Thereupon, the latter, leaving that<br>steedless car, mounted another. Abhimanyu then slew five warriors., named<br>Satrunjaya, and Chandraketu, and Mahamegba, and Suvarchas, and<br>Suryabhasa. He then pierced Suvala's son. The latter piercing Abhimanyu<br>with three arrows, said unto Duryodhana, 'Let us all together grind this<br>one, else, fighting singly with us he will slay us all. O king, think of<br>the means of slaying this one, taking counsel with Drona and Kripa and<br>others.' The Karna, the son of Vikartana, said unto Drona, 'Abhimanyu<br>grindeth us all. Tell us the means by which we may slay him.' Thus<br>addressed, the mighty bowman, Drona, addressing them all, said,<br>'Observing him with vigilance, have any of you been able to detect any<br>defeat in this youth? He is careening in all directions. Yet have any of<br>you been able to detect today the least hole in him? Behold the lightness<br>of hand and quickness of motion of this lion among men, this son of<br>Arjuna. In the track of his car, only his bow drawn to a circle can be<br>seen, so quickly is he aiming his shafts and so quickly is he letting<br>them off. Indeed, this slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the son of<br>Subhadra, gratifieth me although he afflicteth my vital breath and<br>stupefieth me with shafts. Even the mightiest car-warriors, filled with<br>wrath, are unable to detect any flaw in him. The son of Subhadra,<br>therefore, careering on the field of battle, gratifieth me greatly. I do<br>not see that in battle there is any difference between the wielder of<br>Gandiva himself and this one of great lightness of hand, filling all the<br>points of the horizon with his mighty shafts.' Hearing these words,<br>Karna, afflicted with the shafts of Arjuna's son, once more said unto<br>Drona, 'Exceedingly afflicted with the shafts of Abhimanyu, I am staying<br>in battle, only because (as a warrior) I should stay here. Indeed, the<br>arrows of this south of great energy are exceedingly fierce. Terrible as<br>they are and possessed of the energy of fire, these arrows are weakening<br>my heart.' The preceptor then, slowly and with a smile, said unto Karna,<br>'Abhimanyu is young, his prowess is great. His coat of mail is<br>impenetrable. This one's father had been taught by me the method of<br>wearing defensive armour. This subjugator of hostile towns assuredly<br>knoweth the entire science (of wearing armour). With shafts well shot,<br>you can, however, cut off his bow, bow-string, the reins of his steeds,<br>the steeds themselves, and two Parshni charioteers. O mighty bowman, O<br>son of Radha, if competent, do this. Making him turn back from the fight<br>(by this means), strike him then. With his bow in hand he is incapable of<br>being vanquished by the very gods and the Asuras together. If you wish,<br>deprive him of his car, and divest him of his bow.'. Hearing these words<br>of the preceptor, Vikartana's son Karna quickly cut off, by means of his<br>shafts, the bow of Abhimanyu, as the latter was shooting with great<br>activity. He, of Bhoja's race (viz., Kritavarman) then slew his steeds,<br>and Kripa slew his two Parshni charioteers. The others covered him with<br>showers of arrows after he had been divested of his bow. Those six great<br>car-warriors, with great speed, when speed was so necessary, ruthlessly<br>covered that carless youth, fighting single-handed with them, with<br>showers of arrows. Bowless and carless, with an eye, however, to his duty<br>(as a warrior), handsome Abhimanyu, taking up a sword and a shield,<br>jumped into the sky. Displaying great strength and great activity, and<br>describing the tracks called Kausika and others, the son of Arjuna<br>fiercely coursed through the sky, like the prince of winged creatures<br>(viz., Garuda.). 'He may fall upon me sword in hand,' with such thoughts,<br>those mighty bowmen, were on the lookout for the laches of Abhimanyu, and<br>began to pierce him in that battle, with their gaze turned upwards. Then<br>Drona of mighty energy, that conqueror of foes with a sharp arrow quickly<br>cut off the hilt, decked with gems, of Abhimanyu's sword. Radha's son<br>Karna, with sharp shafts, cut off his excellent shield. Deprived of his<br>sword and shield thus, he came down, with sound limbs, from the welkin<br>upon the earth. Then taking up a car-wheel, he rushed in wrath against<br>Drona. His body bright with the dust of car-wheels, and himself holding<br>the car-wheel in his upraised arms, Abhimanyu looked exceedingly<br>beautiful, and imitating Vasudeva (with his discus), became awfully<br>fierce for a while in that battle. His robes dyed with the blood flowing<br>(from his wounds), his brow formidable with the wrinkles visible thereon,<br>himself uttering loud leonine roars, lord Abhimanyu of immeasurable<br>might, staying in the midst of those kings, looked exceedingly<br>resplendent on the field of battle.'"
