                            "Yudhishthira said,&#8212;O mighty-armed one, after thou hadst gone towards<br>the army of the Samsaptakas, the preceptor Drona made fierce endeavours<br>for seizing me. We succeeded, however, in resisting Drona at the head of<br>the array at all points, having in that battle, disposed our vigorously<br>contending car-divisions in counter-array. Held in check by a large<br>number of warriors, and myself also having been well protected, Drona<br>began to smite us with great activity, afflicting us with his whetted<br>shafts. Thus afflicted by him, we could not then even gaze at his army,<br>far less face it in battle. All of us then, addressing thy son by<br>Subhadra, who was equal to thyself, O lord, in prowess said unto him, [O<br>son, pierce this array of Drona!]&#8212;That valorous hero thus urged by us,<br>then sought, like a good horse, to take that burden on himself, however<br>unbearable it might have been for him. Endued as he was with thy energy,<br>aided by that knowledge of weapons which he derived from thee, that child<br>then penetrated unto that array, like Garuda penetrating into the ocean.<br>As regards ourselves, we followed that hero, that son of Subhadra,<br>desirous in that battle, of penetrating (into the Dhritarashtra army) by<br>the same path by which Abhimanyu had entered it. Then, O sire, the<br>wretched king of the Sindhus, viz., Jayadratha, in consequence of the<br>boon granted to him by Rudra, checked all of us! Then Drona, Kripa and<br>Karna and Drona's son, and the king of the Kosalas, and Kritavarman,<br>these six car-warriors surrounded the son of Subhadra. Having surrounded<br>that child all those great car-warriors&#8212;too many for him although he was<br>contending to the utmost of his power, deprived him of his car. After he<br>had been deprived of his car, Dussasana's son, though he himself had a<br>hair-breadth escape, succeeded, as chance would have it, in making<br>Abhimanyu, meet with his end. As regards Abhimanyu, he, having slain many<br>thousands of men and steeds and elephants, and eight thousand cars, and<br>once more nine hundred elephants, two thousand princes, and a large<br>number of heroic warriors unknown to fame, and despatching in that battle<br>king Vrihadvala also to heaven, at last, through ill luck, met with his<br>own death. Thus hath occurred this event that so enhances our grief! That<br>tiger among men hath even thus ascended to heaven! Hearing these words<br>uttered by king Yudhishthira, Arjuna, saying&#8212;Oh son!&#8212;and breathing a<br>deep sigh, fell down on the earth in great pain. Then all the warriors of<br>the Pandavas, surrounding Dhananjaya with cheerless faces began, filled<br>with grief, to look at one another with winkless eyes. Recovering<br>consciousness then, Vasava's son became furious with rage. He seemed to<br>be in a feverish tremor, and sighed frequently. Squeezing his hands,<br>drawing deep breaths, with eyes bathed in tears, and casting his glances<br>like a mad man, he said these words.'<br><br>"Arjuna said,&#8212;-'Truly do I swear that tomorrow I will slay Jayadratha!<br>If from fear of death, he doth not forsake the Dhritarashtras, or implore<br>our protection, or the protection of Krishna that foremost of men or of<br>thine, O king, I shall assuredly slay him tomorrow! Forgetting his<br>friendship for me, engaged in doing what is agreeable to Dhritarashtra's<br>son, that wretch is the cause of the child's slaughter! Tomorrow I will<br>slay him! Whoever they may be that will encounter me in battle tomorrow<br>for protecting him, be it Drona, or Kripa, O king, I will cover them all<br>with my arrow! Ye bulls among men, if I do not achieve even this in<br>(tomorrow's) battle, let me not attain the region., reserved for the<br>righteous, ye foremost of heroes! Those regions that are for them that<br>slay their mothers, or for them that slay their fathers, or them that<br>violate their preceptor's beds, or them that are vile and wicked, or them<br>that cherish envy against the righteous, or them that speak ill of others<br>or them that appropriate the wealth confidingly deposited with them by<br>others, or them that are betrayers of trusts, or them that speak ill of<br>wives enjoyed by them before, or them that have slain Brahmanas, or them<br>that have killed kine, or them that eat sugared milk and rice, or food<br>prepared of barley, or pot-herbs, or dishes prepared of milk, sesamum,<br>and rice, or thin cakes of powdered barley fried in clarified butter or<br>other kinds of cakes, or meat, without having dedicated the same to the<br>gods,&#8212;even those regions shall speedily be mine if I do not slay<br>Jayadratha!&#8212;Those regions to which they go that offer insults to<br>Brahmanas devoted to the study of the Vedas, or otherwise worthy of<br>respect, or to those that are their preceptors, (those regions shall<br>speedily be mine if I do not slay Jayadratha!) That end which becomes<br>theirs who touch Brahmanas or fire with the feet, that end which becomes<br>theirs who throw phlegm and excreta and eject urine into water, even that<br>miserable end shall be mine, if I do not slay Jayadratha! That end which<br>is his who bathes (in water) in a state of nudity, or his who does not<br>hospitably entertain a guest, that end which is theirs who receive<br>bribes, speak falsehood, and deceive and cheat others, that end which is<br>theirs who offend against their own souls, or who falsely utter praises<br>(of others), or of those low wretches who eat sweetmeats in the sight of<br>servants and sons and wives and dependents without sharing the same with<br>those, that awful end shall be mine if I do not slay Jayadratha! That end<br>which overtakes the wretch of ruthless soul who without supporting a<br>righteous and obedient protege casts him off, or him who, without giving<br>unto a deserving neighbour the offerings in Sraddhas, giveth them away<br>unto those that deserve them not, that end which is his who drinks wine,<br>or his who insults those that are worthy of respect, or his who is<br>ungrateful, or his who speaketh ill of his brothers, that end shall soon<br>be mine if I do not stay Jayadratha! The end of all those sinful persons<br>whom I have not mentioned, as also of those whom I have mentioned, shall<br>soon be attained by me, if after this night passes away, I do not slay<br>Jayadratha tomorrow:<br><br>"&#8212;Listen now to another oath of mine! If tomorrow's sun set without my<br>slaying that wretch, then even here I shall enter the blazing fire! Ye<br>Asuras and gods and men. Ye birds and snakes, ye Pitris and all wanderers<br>of the night, ye regenerate Rishis and celestial Rishis, ye mobile and<br>immobile creatures, ye all that I have not mentioned, ye will not succeed<br>in protecting my foe from me! If he enters the abode of the nether<br>region, or ascends the firmament, or repairs to the celestials, or the<br>realms of the Daityas, I shall still, with a hundred arrows, assuredly<br>cut off, on the expiration of this night, the head of Abhimanyu's foe!&#8212;'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued,&#8212;'Having uttered these words, Arjuna began to stretch<br>Gandiva with both his arms. Transcending Arjuna's voice the sound of that<br>bow rose and touched the very heavens. After Arjuna had taken that oath,<br>Janarddana, filled with wrath, blew his conch, Panchajanya. And Phalguna<br>blew Devadatta. The great conch Panchajanya, well filled with the wind<br>from Krishna's mouth, produced a loud blare. And that blare made the<br>regents of the cardinal and the subsidiary points, the nether regions,<br>and the whole universe, to shake, as it happens at the end of the Yuga.<br>Indeed after the high-souled Arjuna had taken the oath, the sound of<br>thousands of musical instruments and loud leonine roars arose from the<br>Pandava camp.
