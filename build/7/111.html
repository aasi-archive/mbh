                            "Sanjaya said, 'Hearing these words of the king Yudhishthira the just,<br>that bull among the Sinis feared the censure of Arjuna if he left the<br>king. Seeing, however, the certainty of an imputation of cowardice by the<br>people (if he disobeyed Yudhishthira), he said to himself, 'Let not<br>people say that I am afraid of proceeding towards Arjuna.' Reflecting<br>repeatedly on this, Satyaki, that hero invincible in battle, that bull<br>among men, said these words unto king Yudhishthira the just, 'If thou<br>thinkest that these arrangements will suffice for thy protection, O<br>monarch, I will then do thy bidding and follow Vibhatsu. I tell thee<br>truly, O king, that there is none in the three worlds who is dearer to me<br>than Phalguna. I will follow in his track at the command, O giver of<br>honours. There is nothing that I will not do for thy sake. O best of men,<br>the commands of my preceptor are always of weight with me. But thy<br>commands are still weightier with me, O lord! Thy brothers, viz., Krishna<br>and Dhananjaya, are always engaged in doing what is agreeable to thee.<br>Taking thy command on my head for the sake of Arjuna, O lord, I will<br>proceed, O bull among men, piercing through this impenetrable host.<br>Darting wrathfully through this force of Drona, like a fish through the<br>sea, I will go thither, O monarch, where king Jayadratha, depending upon<br>his troops, stayeth, in fear of the son of Pandu, protected by those<br>foremost of car-warriors, viz., Drona's son Karna and Kripa! The distance<br>from here, O king, is three Yojanas. I think, of that spot where Partha<br>stayeth, ready to slay Jayadratha! But though Partha is three Yojanas<br>distant I shall yet follow in his track with a stout heart, and stay with<br>him, O king, till Jayadratha's slaughter. What man is there that goes to<br>battle without the commands of his superiors? And when one is commanded,<br>O king, as I have been by thee, who is there like me that would not<br>fight? I know that place whither I shall have to go, O lord! Teeming as<br>this ocean-like host doth with ploughshare and darts and maces and<br>shields and scimitars and swords and lances and foremost of shafts, I<br>will today agitate this ocean. This elephant division, consisting of a<br>thousand elephants, that thou seest, all belonging to the breed known by<br>the name of Anjana and all endued with great prowess, which are all<br>mounted by a large number of Mlecchas, delighting in battle and<br>accomplished in smiting,&#8212;these elephants, O king, that are shedding<br>their juicy secretions like rain-pouring clouds,&#8212;these never retreat if<br>urged forward by those upon their backs. They cannot be vanquished, O<br>king, unless they are slaughtered. Then again, those car-warriors<br>numbering thousands., that thou seest, are all of royal lineage and are<br>all Maharathas. They are called Rukmarathas.[149] They are accomplished<br>in weapons and battling from cars, as also in fighting from the backs of<br>elephants. O monarch! Thorough masters of the science of weapons, they<br>are accomplished in fighting with their fists. Skilled in battling with<br>maces, masters also of the art of close fight, they are equally clever in<br>striking with scimitars and in falling upon the foe with sword and<br>shield. They are brave and learned, and animated by a spirit of rivalry.<br>Every day, O king, they vanquish a vast number of men in battle. They are<br>commanded by Karna and devoted to Duhsasana. Even Vasudeva applauds them<br>as great car-warriors. Always solicitous of Karna's welfare, they are<br>obedient to him. It is at Karna's command, O king, that returning from<br>their pursuit of Arjuna and, therefore, unfatigued and unworn, those<br>brave warriors, cased in impenetrable armour and armed with strong bows,<br>are certainly waiting for me, ordered by Duryodhana also. Crushing them<br>in battle for thy good, O Katirava, I shall then follow in the track of<br>Savyasachin. Those other elephants, O king, seven hundred in number, that<br>thou seest, all cased in armour and ridden by Kiratas, and decked with<br>ornaments, the king of the Kiratas, desirous of his life, had formerly<br>presented to Savyasachin together with many servants in their train.<br>These, O king, were formerly employed in doing thy business. Behold the<br>vicissitudes that time brings about, for these are now battling against<br>thee. Those elephants are ridden by Kiratas difficult of defeat in<br>battle. They are accomplished in fighting from elephants, and are all<br>sprung from the race of Agni. Formerly, they were all vanquished in<br>battle by Savyasachin. They are now waiting for me carefully, under the<br>orders of Duryodhana. Slaying with my shafts, O king, these Kiratas<br>difficult of defeat in battle, I shall follow in the track of Arjuna who<br>is intent on the slaughter of the ruler of the Sindhus. Those (other)<br>huge elephants, sprung from the race of Arjuna, of impenetrable hides,<br>well-trained, and adorned, and from whose mouths the juicy secretions are<br>trickling down, and which are well-adorned with armour made wholly of<br>gold are very formidable in battle and resemble Airavata himself. They<br>have come from the northern hills, and are ridden by fierce robbers that<br>are of strong limbs, that are all foremost of warriors, and that are<br>cased in steel coats of mail. There, amongst them, are persons born of<br>the cow, or the ape, or of diverse other creatures, including those born<br>of men. That division of the assembled Mlecchas that are all sinful and<br>that come from the fastnesses of Himavat, seem at a distance to be of<br>smoky colour. Obtaining these, and countless Kshatriyas, as also Kripa<br>and that foremost of car-warriors, viz., Drona and the ruler of the<br>Sindhus, and the Karna, he thinks lightly of the Pandavas. Impelled by<br>fate, he regards himself crowned with success. Those I have named will,<br>however, today be within reach of my arrows. They shall not escape me, O<br>son of Kunti, even if they be endued with the speed of the mind. Much<br>regarded always by Duryodhana, that prince who dependeth upon the prowess<br>of others, those warriors, afflicted with my clouds of shafts, will meet<br>with destruction. Those other car-warriors, O king, whom thou seest, and<br>who have golden standards and are difficult of being resisted, are called<br>Kamvojas. They are brave and accomplished, and firmly devoted to the<br>science of weapons. Desiring one another's welfare they are all firmly<br>united. They constitute a full Akshauhini of wrathful warriors, O<br>Bharata, and are staying carefully for my sake, well-protected by the<br>Kuru heroes. They are on the alert, O king, with their eyes on me. I<br>shall certainly destroy them all, like fire destroying a heap of straw.<br>Therefore, O king, let those that equip cars, place quivers and all<br>necessaries on my car in proper places. Indeed, in such a dreadful<br>battle, diverse kinds of weapons ought to be taken. Let the car be<br>equipped (with necessaries) five times more than what professors of<br>military science direct, for I shall have to encounter the Kamvojas who<br>resemble fierce snakes of virulent poison. I shall have also to encounter<br>the Kiratas who are armed with diverse weapons of warfare, who resemble<br>virulent poison, who are accomplished in smiting, who have always been<br>well-treated by Duryodhana, and who on that account are always intent on<br>Duryodhana's welfare. I shall also have to encounter the Sakas endued<br>with prowess equal to that of Sakra himself, who are fierce as tire, and<br>difficult to put out like a blazing conflagration. Indeed, O king, I<br>shall have to encounter in battle many warriors difficult of being<br>resisted. For this let well-known steeds of best breed and graced with<br>auspicious marks be yoked to my car, after causing their thirst to be<br>slaked and after grooming them duly!'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'After this, Yudhishthira caused quivers full of<br>shafts, and diverse kinds o weapons, and, indeed, all necessaries, to be<br>placed on Satyaki's car. Then, people caused his four well-harnessed and<br>excellent steeds to drink and walk, bathe and eat, and having adorned<br>them with golden chains and plucked out their arrows, those animals, that<br>had (for these operations) been freed from the yoke, and that were of the<br>hue of gold and well-trained and endued with great speed and cheerful and<br>exceedingly docile, were duly yoked again unto his car. And upon that car<br>was set up a tall standard bearing a lion of golden maces. And that<br>standard had attached round it banners of the hue of white clouds and<br>decked with gold was also placed upon that vehicle bearing a heavy weight<br>of weapons. After those steeds, adorned with trappings of gold, had been<br>yoked to that car, the younger brother of Daruka, who was the charioteer<br>and the dear friend of Satyaki, came and represented unto the latter that<br>the car had been duly equipped, like Matali representing the equipment of<br>the car unto Vasava himself. Satyaki then, having taken a bath and<br>purified himself and undergone every auspicious ceremony, gave nishkas of<br>gold unto a thousand Snataka Brahmanas who uttered benedictions upon him.<br>Blessed with those benedictions Satyaki that foremost of handsome men,<br>that hero worthy of worship, having drunk kairata, honey, shone<br>resplendent, with reddened eyes rolling in intoxication. Having touched a<br>brazen mirror and filled with great joy, his energy became doubled, and<br>himself looked like a blazing fire. Taking upon his shoulders his bow<br>with arrows, that foremost of car-warriors, eased in armour and decked in<br>ornaments, had the regenerate ones perform for him the rites of<br>propitiation. And fair maidens honoured him by showering upon him fried<br>paddy and perfumes and floral garlands. And the hero then, with joined<br>hands, worshipped the feet of Yudhishthira, and the latter smelt his<br>head. And having undergone all these rites, he then mounted his foremost<br>of cars. Then those steeds, cheerful and strong and fleet as the wind,<br>and invincible, and belonging to the Sindhu breed, bore him on that<br>triumphant car. Similarly, Bhimasena also, honoured by king Yudhishthira<br>the just, and reverentially saluting the monarch, set out with Satyaki.<br>Beholding those two chastisers of foes on the point of penetrating thy<br>host, their enemies, viz., thy troops, all stood still with Drona at<br>their head. Then Satyaki, seeing Bhima cased in mail and following him,<br>saluted that hero and spoke unto him these delightful words. Indeed,<br>heroic Satyaki, with every limb filled with joy, said unto Bhima, 'Do<br>thou, O Bhima, protect the king. Even this is thy duty above all things.<br>Piercing through this host whose hour hath come. I will proceed. Whether<br>now or hence, the protection of the king is thy highest duty. Thou<br>knowest my prowess, thou desirest my good, return, O Bhima!' Thus<br>addressed by Satyaki, Bhima replied, Go then, for the success of thy<br>object. O best of men, I will protect the king.' Thus addressed, he of<br>Madhu's race answered Bhima, saying, 'Go back, O son of Pritha! My<br>success is certain, since won over by my merits, thus, O Bhima, art today<br>obedient to my wishes. Indeed, O Bhima, as these auspicious omens tell<br>me, my victory is assured. After the sinful ruler of the Sindhus has been<br>slain by the high-souled son of Pandu, I shall embrace king Yudhishthira<br>of virtuous soul.' Having said these words unto Bhima and dismissing him<br>with an embrace that illustrious warrior eyed thy troops, like a tiger<br>eyeing a herd of deer. Beholding him thus looking at thy army, O king,<br>thy troops become once more stupefied and began to tremble violently.<br>Then, O king, Satyaki desirous of seeing Arjuna at the command of king<br>Yudhishthira the just, suddenly dashed against thy troops.'"
