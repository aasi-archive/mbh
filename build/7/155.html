                            "Sanjaya said, 'After his son (Bhurisravas) had been slain by Satyaki<br>while the former was sitting in Praya, Somadatta, filled with rage, said<br>unto Satyaki these words, 'Why, O Satwata, 'having abandoned those<br>Kshatriya duties ordained by the high-souled gods, hast thou betaken<br>thyself to the practices of robbers? Why would one that is observant of<br>Kshatriya duties and possessed of wisdom, strike in battle a person that<br>is turning away from the fight, or one that has become helpless, or one<br>that has laid aside his weapons, or one that beggeth for quarters? Two<br>persons, indeed, among the Vrishnis are reputed to be the foremost of<br>great car-warriors, viz., Pradyumna of mighty energy and thou also, O<br>Satyaki! Why then didst thou behave so cruelly and sinfully towards one<br>that had sat on Praya and that had his arms cut off by Partha?[196] Take<br>now in battle the consequence of that act of thine, O thou of wicked<br>behaviour! I shall today, O wretch, putting forth my prowess, cut off<br>thy. head with a winged arrow. I swear, O Satwata, by my two sons, by<br>what is dear to me, and by all my meritorious acts, that, if before this<br>night passes away, I do not slay thee, that art so proud of thy heroism,<br>with thy sons and younger brothers, provided Jishnu, the son of Pritha,<br>does not protect thee, then let me sink into terrible hell, O wretch of<br>Vrishni's race!' Having said these words, the mighty Somadatta, filled<br>with rage, blew his conch loudly and uttered a leonine roar. Then<br>Satyaki, of eyes like lotus-petals and teeth like those of a lion,<br>possessed of great strength, and filled with rage, said these words unto<br>Somadatta, 'O thou of Kuru's race, whether battling with thee or with<br>others, I do not in my heart ever experience the slightest fear. If,<br>protected by all the troops, thou fightest with me, I would not, even<br>then experience on thy account, any pain, O thou of Kuru's race! I am<br>ever observant of Kshatriya practices. Thou canst not, therefore,<br>frighten me with only words smacking of battle or with speeches that<br>insult the good. If, O king, thou wishest to fight with me today, be<br>cruel and strike me with keen shafts and I will also strike thee. Thy<br>son, the mighty car-warrior Bhurisravas, O king, had been slain. Sala<br>also, and Vrishasena, have been crushed by me. Thee also today I shall<br>slay, with thy soils and kinsmen. Stay with resolution in battle, for<br>thou, O Katirava, art endued with great strength. Thou art already slain<br>in consequence of the energy of that drum-bannered king Yudhishthira in<br>whom are always charity, and self-restraint, and purity of heart,<br>compassion, and modesty, and intelligence, and forgiveness, and all else<br>that is indestructible. Thou shalt meet with destruction along with Karna<br>and Suvala's son. I swear by Krishna's feet and by all my good acts that,<br>filled with rage, I shall, with my shafts, slay thee with thy sons in<br>battle. If thou fliest away from battle, then mayst thou have safety.'<br>Having thus addressed each other, with eyes red in wrath, those foremost<br>of men began to shoot their shafts at each other. Then with a thousand<br>cars and ten thousand horses, Duryodhana took his station, encompassing<br>Somadatta, Sakuni also, filled with rage, and armed with every weapon and<br>surrounded by his sons and grandsons as also by his brothers, that were<br>equal to Indra himself in prowess (did the same). Thy brother-in-law, O<br>king, young in years and of body hard as the thunder-bolt and possessed<br>of wisdom, had a hundred thousand horses of the foremost valour with him.<br>With these he encompassed the mighty bowman Somadatta. Protected by those<br>mighty warriors, Somadatta covered Satyaki (with clouds of shafts).<br>Beholding Satyaki thus covered with clouds of straight shafts,<br>Dhrishtadyumna proceeded towards him in rage and accompanied by a mighty<br>force. Then, O king, the sound that arose there of those two large hosts<br>striking each other, resembled that of many oceans lashed into fury by<br>frightful hurricanes. Then Somadatta pierced Satyaki, with nine arrows.<br>Satyaki, in return, struck that foremost of Kuru warriors with nine<br>arrows. Deeply pierced in that battle by the mighty and firm bowman<br>(Satyaki), Somadatta sat down on the terrace of his car and lost his<br>senses in a swoon, Beholding him deprived of his senses, his driver, with<br>great speed, bore away from the battle that great car-warrior, viz., the<br>heroic Somadatta. Seeing that Somadatta, afflicted with Yuyudhana's<br>shafts, had lost his senses Drona rushed with speed, desiring to slay the<br>Yadu hero. Beholding the Preceptor advance, many Pandava warriors headed<br>by Yudhishthira surrounded that illustrious perpetuator of Yadu's race<br>from desire of rescuing him. Then commenced a battle between Drona and<br>the Pandavas, resembling that between Vali and the celestials for<br>acquiring sovereignty oft the three worlds. Then Bharadwaja's son of<br>great energy shrouded the Pandava host with clouds of arrows and pierced<br>Yudhishthira also. And Drona pierced Satyaki with ten arrows, and the son<br>of Prishata with twenty. And he pierced Bhimasena with nine arrows and<br>Nakula with five, and Sahadeva with eight, and Sikhandin with a hundred.<br>And the mighty-armed hero pierced each of the (five) sons of Draupadi<br>with five arrows. And he pierced Virata with eight arrows and Drupada<br>with ten. And he pierced Yudhamanyu with three arrows and Uttamaujas with<br>six in that encounter. And piercing many other combatants, he rushed<br>towards Yudhishthira. The troops of Pandu's son, slaughtered by Drona,<br>ran away in all directions, from fear, O king, with loud wails. Beholding<br>that host slaughtered by Drona. Phalguna, the son of Pritha, with wrath<br>excited a little, quickly proceeded towards the preceptor. Beholding then<br>that Drona was also proceeding towards Arjuna in that battle, that host<br>of Yudhishthira, O king, once more rallied. Then once more occurred a<br>battle between Drona and the Pandavas. Drona, surrounded, O king, on all<br>sides, by thy sons, began to consume the Pandava host, like fire<br>consuming a heap of cotton. Beholding him radiant like the sun and endued<br>with the splendour of a blazing fire, and fiercely and continually, O<br>king, emitting his ray-like arrows, with bow incessantly drawn to a<br>circle and scorching everything around like the sun himself, and<br>consuming his foes, there was none in that army that could check him. The<br>shafts of Drona cutting off the head of all those that ventured to<br>approach him in the face, penetrated into the earth. Thus slaughtered by<br>that illustrious warrior, the Pandava host, once more fled away in fear<br>in the very sight of Arjuna. Beholding that force, O Bharata, thus routed<br>on that night by Drona, Jishnu asked Govinda to proceed towards Drona's<br>car. Then he of Dasarha's race urged those steeds, white as silver or<br>milk or the Kunda flower, or the moon, towards the car of Drona.<br>Bhimasena also, beholding Phalguna proceed towards Drona, commanded his<br>own charioteer, saying, 'Bear me towards Drona's division.' Hearing those<br>words of Bhima, his driver Visoka urged his steeds, following in the<br>wake, O chief of the Bharatas, of Jishnu, of sure aim. Beholding the two<br>brothers resolutely proceeding towards Drona's division, the mighty<br>car-warriors among the Panchalas, the Srinjayas, the Matsyas, the Chedis,<br>the Karushas, the Kosalas, and the Kaikeyas, O king, all followed them.<br>Then, O monarch, took place a terrible battle that made the hair stand on<br>end. With two mighty throngs of cars, Vibhatsu and Vrikodara attacked thy<br>host; the former on the right and the latter in the front. Seeing those<br>tigers among men, viz., Bhimasena and Dhananjaya (thus engaged),<br>Dhrishtadyumna, O monarch, and Satyaki of great strength, rushed behind.<br>Then, O king, an uproar arose there in consequence of the two hosts<br>striking each other, that resembled the noise made by many seas lashed<br>into fury by a tempest. Beholding Satyaki in battle, Aswatthaman, filled<br>with rage at the slaughter of Somadatta's son, rushed furiously against<br>that Satwata hero at the van of battle. Seeing him rush in that battle<br>against the car of Sini's grandson, Bhimasena's son, the gigantic<br>Rakshasa, Ghatotkacha, endued with great strength, rushed at him, riding<br>on a huge and terrible car made of black iron covered with bear-skins.<br>Both the height and the width of that large car measured thirty<br>nalwas.[197] Equipped with machines set in proper places it was; its<br>rattle resembled that of a mighty mass of clouds. No steeds or elephants<br>were yoked unto it, but, instead, beings that looked like elephants.[198]<br>On its tall standard perched a prince of vultures with outstretched wings<br>and feet, with eyes wide-expanded, and shrieking awfully. And it was<br>equipped with red flags and decked with the entrails of various animals.<br>And that huge vehicle was furnished with eight wheels. Riding on it,<br>Ghatotkacha was surrounded by a full Akshauhini of fierce-looking<br>Rakshasas armed with lances and heavy clubs and rocks and trees. Seeing<br>him advance with uplifted bow, resembling the mace-armed Destroyer<br>himself in the hour of universal dissolution, the hostile kings were<br>struck with fear. At sight of that prince of Rakshasas, viz.,<br>Ghatotkacha, looking like a mountain summit of terrible aspect,<br>frightful, possessed of terrible teeth and fierce face, with arrow-like<br>ears and high cheek-bones, with stiff hair rising upwards, awful eyes,<br>sunken belly, blazing mouth, wide as a chasm, and diadem on his head,<br>capable of striking every creature with fear, possessing jaws wide-open<br>like those of the Destroyer, endued with great splendour and capable of<br>agitating all foes, advancing towards them, thy son's host, afflicted<br>with fear, became highly agitated like the current of the Ganga agitated<br>into fierce eddies by (the action of) the wind. Terrified by the leonine<br>roar uttered by Ghatotkacha, elephants began to eject urine and the kings<br>began to tremble. Then, thrown by the Rakshasas who had become more<br>powerful in consequence of the night, there began to fall on the field of<br>battle a thick shower of stones. And a ceaseless shower of iron wheels<br>and Bhundis and darts and lances and spears and Sataghnis and axes also<br>fell there. Beholding that fierce and awful battle, the kings, thy sons,<br>and Karna, also exceedingly pained, fled away. Only the proud son of<br>Drona, ever boastful of his might in arms, stood fearlessly. And he soon<br>dispelled that illusion that had been created by Ghatotkacha. Upon the<br>destruction of his illusion, Ghatotkacha in rage sped fierce shafts<br>(Aswatthaman). These pierced the son of Drona, like angry snakes speedily<br>piercing through an ant-hill. Those arrows, having pierced through the<br>body of Aswatthaman, dyed with blood and quickly entered the earth like<br>snakes into an ant-hill. The light-handed Aswatthaman, however, of great<br>prowess, filled with wrath, pierced Ghatotkacha with ten arrows.<br>Ghatotkacha, deeply pierced in his vital parts by Drona's son, and<br>feeling great pain, took up a wheel having a thousand spokes. Its edge<br>was sharp as a razor, and it was resplendent as the rising sun. And it<br>was decked with diverse gems and diamonds. Desirous of slaying him, the<br>son of Bhimasena hurled that wheel at Aswatthaman. And as that wheel<br>coursed swiftly towards Drona's son, the latter cut it into fragments by<br>means of his shafts. Baffled, it fell down on the earth, like the hope<br>cherished by an unfortunate man. Beholding his wheel baffled, Ghatotkacha<br>quickly covered the son of Drona with his shafts, like Rahu swallowing<br>the sun. Meanwhile, Ghatotkacha's son endued with great splendour and<br>looking like a mass of antimony, checked the advancing son of Drona like<br>the king of mountain (Meru) checking the (course of the) wind. Afflicted<br>with showers of shafts by Bhimasena's grandson, viz., the brave<br>Anjanaparvan, Aswatthaman looked like the mountain Meru bearing a torrent<br>of rain from a mighty cloud. Then Aswatthaman, equal unto Rudra or<br>Upendra in prowess, became filled with rage. With one shaft he cut off<br>the standard of Anjanaparvan. With two others, his two drivers, and with<br>three others, his Trivenuka. And he cut off the Rakshasa's bow with one<br>arrow, and his four steeds with four other arrows, Made carless,<br>Anjanaparvan took up a scimitar. With another keen shaft, Aswatthaman cut<br>off in two fragments that scimitar, decked with golden stars, in the<br>Rakshasa's hand. The grandson of Hidimva then, O king, whirling a gold<br>adorned mace, quickly hurled it at Aswatthaman. Drona's son, however,<br>striking it with his shafts, caused it to fall down on the earth. Soaring<br>up then into the sky, Anjanaparvan began to roar like a cloud. And from<br>the welkin he showered trees upon his foe. Like the sun piercing a mass<br>of clouds with his rays, Aswatthaman then began to pierce with his shafts<br>the son of Ghatotkacha, that receptacle of illusions, in the welkin.<br>Gifted with great energy, the Rakshasa once more came down on his gold<br>decked car. He then looked like a high and beautiful hill of antimony on<br>the surface of the earth. The son of Drona then slew that son of Bhima's<br>son, viz., Anjanaparvan, cased in an iron coat of mail, even as Mahadeva<br>had slain in days of yore the Asura Andhaka. Beholding his mighty son<br>slain by Aswatthaman, Ghatotkacha, coming unto the son of Drona,<br>fearlessly addressed the heroic son of Saradwata's daughter, who was then<br>consuming the Pandava troops like a raging forest-conflagration, in these<br>words:<br><br>"Ghatotkacha said, 'Wait, Wait, O son of Drona! Thou shalt not escape me<br>with life! I shall slay thee today like Agni's son slaying Krauncha.'<br><br>"Aswatthaman said, 'Go, O son, and fight with others, O thou that hast<br>the prowess of a celestial. It is not proper, O son of Hidimva, that sire<br>should battle with son.[199] I do not cherish any grudge against thee, O<br>son of Hidimva! When, however, one's ire is excited, one may kill one's<br>own self.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Having heard these words, Ghatotkacha, filled with<br>grief on account of the fall of his son, and with eyes red as copper in<br>wrath, approached Aswatthaman and said, 'Am I a dastard in battle, O son<br>of Drona, like a vulgar person, that thou dost frighten me thus with<br>words? Thy words are improper. Verily, I have been begotten by Bhima in<br>the celebrated race of the Kurus. I am a son of the Pandavas, those<br>heroes that never retreat from battle. I am the king of the Rakshasas,<br>equal to the Ten-necked (Ravana) in might. Wait, wait, O son of Drona!<br>Thou shalt not escape me with life. I shall today, on the field of<br>battle, dispel thy desire for fight.' Having thus replied unto<br>Aswatthaman, that mighty Rakshasa with eyes red as copper in rage, rushed<br>furiously against the son of Drona, like a lion against a prince of<br>elephants. And Ghatotkacha began to shower upon that bull among<br>car-warriors, viz., Drona's son, shafts of the measure of Aksha of battle<br>car, like a cloud pouring torrents of rain. Drona's son however, with his<br>own shafts, checked that arrowy shower before it could reach him. At that<br>time, it seemed that another encounter was taking place in the welkin<br>between shafts (as the combatants). The welkin, then, during the night,<br>shone resplendent with the sparks caused by the clash of those weapons,<br>as if with (myriads of) flies. Observing that his illusion was dispelled<br>by Drona's son, proud of his prowess in battle, Ghatotkacha, once more<br>making himself invisible, created an illusion. He assumed the form of a<br>high mountain, crowded with cliffs and trees, and possessing fountains<br>from which ceaselessly flowed spears and lances and swords and heavy<br>clubs. Beholding that mountain-like mass of antimony, with countless<br>weapons falling from it, Drona's son was not at all moved. The latter<br>invoked into existence the Vajra weapon.[200] The prince of mountains,<br>then, struck with that weapon, was quickly destroyed. Then the Rakshasa,<br>becoming a mass of blue clouds in the firmament, decked with rainbow,<br>began furiously to shower upon Drona's son in that battle a downpour of<br>stones and rocks. Then that foremost of all persons acquainted with<br>weapons, viz., Aswatthaman, aiming the Vayavya weapon, destroyed that<br>blue cloud which had risen on the firmament. Drona's son, that foremost<br>of men, covering then all the points of the compass with his shafts, slew<br>a hundred thousand car-warriors. He then beheld Ghatotkacha fearlessly<br>coming towards him with bent bow and accompanied by a large number of<br>Rakshasas that resembled lions or infuriated elephants of great strength,<br>some riding on elephants, some on cars, and some on steeds. The son of<br>Hidimva was accompanied by those fierce followers of his, with frightful<br>faces and heads and necks. Those Rakshasas consisted of both Paulastyas<br>and Yatudhanas.[201] Their prowess was equal to that of Indra himself.<br>They were armed with diverse kinds of weapons and were cased in diverse<br>kinds of armour. Of terrible visage, they swelled with rage. Ghatotkacha<br>came to battle, accompanied by those Rakshasas, who were, indeed,<br>incapable of being easily defeated in battle. Beholding them, thy son,<br>Duryodhana, became exceedingly cheerless. Unto him the son of Drona said,<br>'Wait, O Duryodhana! Thou needst have no fear. Stand aside with these thy<br>heroic brothers and these lords of earth, endued with the prowess of<br>Indra. I will slay thy foes. Defeat thou shalt not have. I tell thee<br>truly. Meanwhile, assure thy troops.'<br><br>"Duryodhana said, 'I do not regard what thou sayest to be at all<br>wonderful, since thy heart is large. O son of Gautama's daughter, thy<br>regard for us is great.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, Having said those words unto Aswatthaman, he then<br>addressed the son of Suvala, saying, 'Dhananjaya is engaged in battle<br>surrounded by a hundred thousand car-warriors of great valour. Go thou<br>against him, with sixty thousand cars. Karna also, and Vrishasena and<br>Kripa, and Nila, and the Northerners, and Kritavarman, and the sons of<br>Purumitra, and Duhsasana, and Nikumbha, and Kundabhedin, and Puranjaya<br>and Dridharatha, and Hemakampana, and Salya, and Aruni, and Indrasena,<br>and Sanjaya, and Vijaya, and Jaya, and Purakrathin, and Jayavarman, and<br>Sudarsana, these will follow thee, with sixty thousand foot-soldiers. O<br>uncle, slay Bhima and the twins and king Yudhishthira the Just, like the<br>chief of the celestials slaying the Asuras. My hope of victory is in<br>thee. Already pierced by Drona's son with shafts, all their limbs have<br>been exceedingly mangled. Slay the sons of Kunti, O uncle, like Kartikeya<br>slaying the Asuras.' Thus addressed by thy son, Sakuni proceeded quickly<br>to destroy the Pandavas, filling thy son's heart, O king, with delight.<br><br>"Meanwhile, O king, the battle that took place between the Rakshasas and<br>the son of Drona on that night was exceedingly terrible like that between<br>Sakra and Prahlada (in days of old). Ghatotkacha, filled with rage,<br>struck Drona's son in the chest with ten powerful shafts fierce as poison<br>or fire. Deeply pierced with those shafts by the son of Bhimasena,<br>Aswatthaman trembled on the terrace of his car like a tall tree shaken by<br>the tempest. Once more Ghatotkacha, with a broad-headed shaft, quickly<br>cut off the bright bow that was in the hands of Drona's son. The latter,<br>then, taking up another bow capable of bearing of great strain, showered<br>keen arrows (upon his foe) like a cloud pouring torrents of rain. Then<br>the son of Saradwat's daughter, O Bharata, sped many sky-ranging and<br>foe-slaying arrows, winged with gold, towards the sky-ranging Rakshasa.<br>Afflicted with those shafts of Aswatthaman, that vast force of<br>broad-chested Rakshasas looked like a herd of infuriated elephants<br>afflicted by lions. Consuming with his arrows those Rakshasas with their<br>steeds, drivers, and elephants, he blazed forth like the adorable Agni<br>while consuming creatures at the end of the Yuga. Having burnt with his<br>shafts a full Akshauhini of Rakshasa troops, Aswatthaman shone<br>resplendent like the divine Maheswara in heaven after the burning of the<br>triple city.[202] That foremost of victors, viz., Drona's son, having<br>burnt thy foes, shone brilliantly like the blazing Yuga-fire after having<br>burnt all creatures at the end of the Yuga. Then Ghatotkacha, filled with<br>rage, urged that vast Rakshasa force on, saying, 'Slay the son of Drona!'<br>That command of Ghatotkacha was obeyed by those terrible Rakshasa of<br>bright teeth, large faces, frightful aspects, gaping mouths, long tongues<br>and eyes blazing with wrath. Causing the earth to be filled with their<br>loud leonine roars, and armed with diverse kinds of weapons, they rushed<br>against the son of Drona for slaying him. Endued with fierce prowess,<br>those Rakshasas, with eyes red in wrath, fearlessly hurled at<br>Aswatthaman's head hundreds and thousands of darts, and Sataghnis, and<br>spiked maces, and Asanis and long lances, and axes, and scimitars, and<br>maces, and short arrows and heavy clubs, and battle-axes, and spears, and<br>swords, and lances, and polished Kampanas and Kunapas, and Hulas, and<br>rockets, and stones, and vessels of (hot) treacle, and thunas made of<br>black iron, and mallets, all of terrible forms and capable of destroying<br>foes. Beholding that thick shower of weapons falling upon the head of<br>Drona's son, thy warriors were much pained. The son of Drona, however,<br>fearlessly destroyed with his whetted shafts endued with the force of the<br>thunder that frightful shower of weapons looking like a risen cloud. Then<br>the high-souled son of Drona, with other weapons, equipped with golden<br>wings and inspired with mantras speedily slew many Rakshasas. Afflicted<br>with those shafts, that vast force of broad-chested Rakshasas looked like<br>a herd of infuriated elephants afflicted by lions. Then those mighty<br>Rakshasas, thus afflicted Drona's son, became filled with fury and rushed<br>against the former. The prowess that the son of Drona then showed was<br>exceedingly wonderful, for the feat he achieved is incapable of being<br>achieved by any other being among living creatures, since, alone and<br>unsupported, that warrior acquainted with high and mighty weapons burnt<br>that Rakshasa force with his blazing shafts in the very sight of that<br>prince of Rakshasas. Whilst consuming that Rakshasa force, Drona's son in<br>that battle shone resplendent like the Samvartaka fire, while burning all<br>creatures at the end of the Yuga. Indeed, amongst those thousands of<br>kings and those Pandavas, O Bharata, there was none, except that mighty<br>prince of the Rakshasa, viz., the heroic Ghatotkacha, capable of even<br>looking at the son of Drona in that battle, who was thus employed in<br>consuming their ranks with his shafts, resembling snakes of virulent<br>poison. The Rakshasa, O chief of the Bharatas, with eyes rolling in<br>wrath, striking his palms, and biting his (nether) lip, addressed his own<br>driver, saying, 'Bear me towards the son of Drona.' Riding on that<br>formidable car equipped with triumphal banners, that slayer of foes once<br>more proceeded against Drona's son, desirous of a single combat with the<br>latter. Endued with terrible prowess, the Rakshasa, uttering a loud<br>leonine roar, hurled in that encounter at Drona's son, having whirled it<br>(previously), a terrible Asani of celestial workmanship, and equipped<br>with eight bells.[203] Drona's son, however, jumping down from his car,<br>having left his bow thereon, seized it and hurled it back at Ghatotkacha<br>himself. Ghatotkacha, meanwhile, had quickly alighted from his car. That<br>formidable Asani, of dazzling effulgence, having reduced to ashes the<br>Rakshasa's vehicle with steeds and drivers and standard, entered the<br>earth, having pierced her through. Beholding that feat of Drona's son,<br>viz., his having jumped down and seized that terrible Asani of celestial<br>workmanship, all creatures applauded it. Proceeding then, O king, to<br>Dhrishtadyumna's car, Bhimasena's son, taking up a terrible bow that<br>resembled the large bow of Indra himself, once more shot many keen shafts<br>at the illustrious son of Drona. Dhrishtadyumna also fearlessly shot at<br>Aswatthaman's chest many foremost of shafts, equipped with wings of gold<br>and resembling snakes of virulent poison. Then Drona's son shot arrows<br>and long shafts by thousands. These two heroes, however, viz.,<br>Ghatotkacha and Dhrishtadyumna, struck and baffled Aswatthaman's shafts<br>by means of their own shafts whose touch resembled that of fire. The<br>battle then that took place between those two lions among men<br>(Ghatotkacha on the one side) and the son of Drona (on the other) became<br>fierce in the extreme and gladdened all the combatants, O bull of<br>Bharata's race! Then, accompanied by a thousand cars, three hundred<br>elephants, and six thousand horses, Bhimasena arrived at that spot. The<br>virtuous son of Drona, however, endued as he was with prowess that knew<br>no fatigue, continued to fight with the heroic son of Bhima and with<br>Dhrishtadyumna supported by his followers.[204] The prowess then that<br>Drona's son displayed on that occasion was exceedingly wonderful, in as<br>much as, O Bharata, none else amongst all creatures is capable of<br>accomplishing such feats. Within the twinkling of an eye, he destroyed,<br>by means of his sharp shafts, a full Akshauhini of Rakshasa troops with<br>steeds, drivers, cars, and elephants, in the very sight of Bhimasena and<br>Hidimva's son and Prishata's son and the twins and Dharma's son and<br>Vijaya and Achyuta.[205] Deeply struck with the straight-going shafts (of<br>Aswatthaman), elephants fell down on elephants on the earth like<br>crestless mountains. Strewn all around with the lopped off trunks of<br>elephants, that moved still in convulsions, the earth looked as if<br>overspread with moving snakes. And the earth looked resplendent with<br>golden staves and royal umbrellas, like the firmament at the end of the<br>Yuga, bespangled with planets and stars and many moons and suns. And<br>Drona's son caused a bloody river of impetuous current to flow there. The<br>blood of elephants and steeds and combatants formed its water; tall<br>standards its frogs; drums formed its large tortoises; umbrellas, its<br>rows of swans, yak-tails in profusion, Kankas and vultures, its<br>crocodiles; weapons its fishes; large elephants the stones and rocks on<br>its banks; elephants and steeds, its sharks; cars, its unstable and broad<br>banks; and banners, its beautiful rows of trees. Having shafts for its<br>(smaller) fishes, that frightful river had lances and darts and swords<br>for snakes; marrow and flesh for its mire, and trunkless bodies floating<br>on it for its rafts. And it was choked with the hair (of men and animals)<br>for its moss. And it inspired the timid with cheerlessness and fear. And<br>bloody waves were seen on its surface. Rendered frightful by means of the<br>foot-soldiers with which it teemed, Yama's abode, was the ocean towards<br>which it flowed. Having slain the Rakshasas, Drona's son then began to<br>afflict the son of Hidimva with arrows. Filled once more with rage, the<br>puissant son of Drona having pierced those mighty car-warriors, viz., the<br>Parthas including Vrikodara and the sons of Prishata, slew Suratha, one<br>of the sons of Drupada. Then he slew in that battle Suratha's younger<br>brother named Satrunjaya. And then he slew Valanika and Jayanika, and<br>Jaya. And once more, with a keen shaft, Drona's son' uttering a leonine<br>roar, slew Prishdhra, and then proud Chandrasena. And then he slew with<br>ten arrows the ten sons of Kuntibhoja. Then, O king, Drona's son<br>despatched Srutayus to the abode of Yama. With three other keen shafts,<br>equipped with beautiful wings and red eyes, he despatched the mighty<br>Satrunjaya to the region of Sakra.[206] Then Aswatthaman, filled with<br>rage, fixed on his bowstring a fierce and straight arrow. Drawing the<br>string to his ear, he quickly shot that fierce and excellent arrow<br>resembling the rod of Death himself, aiming at Ghatotkacha. That mighty<br>shaft, equipped with beautiful wings, passing through the chest of that<br>Rakshasa, O lord of the earth, entered the earth, piercing through it,<br>Ghatotkacha thereupon fell down on the car. Beholding him fallen down and<br>believing him to be dead, the mighty car-warrior Dhrishtadyumna took him<br>away from the presence of Drona's son and caused him to be placed upon<br>another car. Thus, O king, that car-force of Yudhishthira turned away<br>from the fight. The heroic son of Drona having vanquished his foes,<br>uttered a loud roar. And he was worshipped by all men and all thy sons, O<br>sire.'[207] The earth, strewn all around with the fallen bodies of dead<br>Rakshasas, pierced and mangled with hundreds of arrows, became fierce<br>looking and impassable, as if strewn with mountain summits. The Siddhas<br>and Gandharvas and Pisachas, and Nagas, and birds, and Pitris and ravens<br>and large numbers of cannibals and ghosts, and Apsaras and celestials,<br>all combined in highly applauding the son of Drona.'"
