                            "Sanjaya said, 'O king, when Yuyudhana, from desire of battle proceeded<br>against thy troops, king Yudhishthira, surrounded by his forces, followed<br>Yuyudhana for reaching the car of Drona. Then the son of the king of the<br>Panchalas, viz., the invincible warrior Dhrishtadyumna, the king<br>Vasudana, both loudly exclaimed with the Pandava host, 'Come, smite<br>quickly, and rush against the foe, so that Satyaki, that warrior<br>invincible battle, in might pass easily (through the Kaurava host). Many<br>mighty car-warriors will struggle for vanquishing him.' The great<br>car-warriors (of the Pandava army). saying this, fell impetuously upon<br>their foes. Indeed, they all rushed, saying, 'We will vanquish those that<br>will endeavour to vanquish Satyaki.' Then a loud uproar was heard about<br>the car of Satyaki. Thy son's host, however, covered with Satyaki's<br>shafts, fled away. Indeed, O king that host was broken into a hundred<br>struggling bodies by him of the Satwata race. And while that force was<br>breaking, that mighty car-warrior, viz., the (grandson) of Sini, crushed<br>seven heroic and great bowmen in the front rank of the foe. And, O<br>monarch, with his shafts that resembled blazing flames of fire, he<br>despatched many other heroes, kings of diverse realms, unto the region of<br>Yama. He sometimes pierced a hundred warriors with one shaft, and<br>sometimes one warrior with a hundred shafts. Like the great Rudra<br>destroying creatures, he slew elephant-riders and car-warriors with<br>steeds and drivers. None amongst thy troops ventured to advance against<br>Satyaki who was displaying such lightness of hand and who showered such<br>clouds of shafts. Struck with panic and crushed grounded thus by that<br>hero of long arms, those brave warriors all left the field at the sight<br>of that proud hero. Although alone, they saw him multiplied manifold, and<br>were stupefied by his energy. And the earth looked exceedingly beautiful<br>with crushed cars and broken nidas,[150] O sire, and wheels and fallen<br>umbrellas and standards and anukarshas, and banners, and headgears decked<br>with gold, and human arms smeared with sandal-paste and adorned with<br>Angadas, O king, and human thighs, resembling trunks of elephants or the<br>tapering bodies of snakes, and faces, beautiful as the moon and decked<br>with ear-rings, of large-eyed warriors lying all about the field. And the<br>ground there looked exceedingly beautiful with the huge bodies of fallen<br>elephants, cut off in diverse ways, like a large plain strewn with hills.<br>Crushed by that hero of long arms, steeds, deprived of life and fallen<br>down on the ground, looked beautiful in their traces made of burnished<br>gold and decked with rows of pearls, and in their carcasses of handsome<br>make and design. Having slain diverse kinds of thy troops, he of the<br>Satwata race entered into thy host, agitating and routing thy army. Then<br>Satyaki desired to go by that very track by which Dhananjaya had gone<br>before him. Then Drona came and resisted him. Encountering the son of<br>Bharadwaja, Yuyudhana., filled with rage, stopped not like a vast expanse<br>of water upon encountering on embankment. Drona, however, checking in<br>that battle the mighty car-warrior Yuyudhana, pierced him with five keen<br>shafts, capable of penetrating into the very vitals. Satyaki, however, O<br>king, in that battle pierced Drona with seven shafts whetted on stone,<br>equipped with golden wings and the feathers of the Kanka and the peacock.<br>Then Drona, afflicted Satyaki, his steeds and the drivers, with six<br>shafts. The mighty car-warrior Yuyudhana could not brook that feat of<br>Drona. Uttering a leonine shout, he then pierced Drona with ten shafts,<br>and then with six, and then with eight others. And once more Yuyudhana<br>pierced Drona with ten shafts, his charioteer with one and his four<br>steeds with four. And with another shaft, O sire, Satyaki struck Drona's<br>standard. Then, Drona speedily covered Satyaki, his car, steeds, driver,<br>and standard, with swiftly coursing shafts, countless in number like a<br>flight of locusts. Similarly, Yuyudhana fearlessly covered Drona with<br>countless shafts of great speed. Then Drona, addressing Yuyudhana, said,<br>'Thy preceptor (Arjuna) hath, like a coward, gone away, leaving the<br>battle, avoiding me who was fighting with him, proceeding by my flank. O<br>thou of Madhu's race, if like thy preceptor, thou too dost not quickly<br>avoid me in this battle, thou shalt not escape me with life today,<br>engaged as I am in battle with thee.<br><br>"Satyaki, hearing these words, answered, 'At the command of king<br>Yudhishthira the just, I shall follow in the track of Dhananjaya. Blessed<br>be thou, O Brahmana, I would lose time (if I fight with thee). A disciple<br>should always tread in the way trod by his preceptor. I shall, therefore<br>follow in the track that has been trod by my preceptor.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Having said this much, the grandson of Sini avoided<br>the preceptor and suddenly proceeded onwards, O king! And addressing his<br>charioteer, he said, 'Drona will, by every means, endeavour to check my<br>progress. Proceed carefully, O Suta, in battle and listen to these grave<br>words of mine. Yonder is seen the host of great splendour of Avantis.<br>Next to them, is the mighty host of the Southerners. And next to it, is<br>the great host of the Valhikas. By the side of the Valhikas, stands<br>resolved for fight the mighty host commanded by Karna. O charioteer, all<br>these hosts are different from one another, but relying upon one another,<br>they protect one another on the field of battle. Arrived at the space<br>left open between these divisions cheerfully urge thou the steed. Indeed,<br>O charioteer, bear me thither, making the steeds adopt a tolerable<br>speed,&#8212;thither, that is, where are seen the Valhikas with diverse<br>weapons uplifted in their arms, and the countless Southerners headed by<br>the Suta's son and whose division is seen to present a serried array of<br>elephants and steeds and cars and in which stand foot-soldiers from<br>various realm.' Having said this much unto his driver, avoiding the<br>Brahmana (Drona), he proceeded, telling his charioteer, Pass through the<br>open space between those two divisions towards the fierce and mighty host<br>of Karna.' Drona, however, excited with wrath, pursued him from behind,<br>shooting at him countless shafts. Indeed, the preceptor closely followed<br>highly blessed Yuyudhana who advanced without any desire of turning back.<br>Smiting the great host of Karna with whetted arrows, Satyaki penetrated<br>into the vast and limitless army of the Bharatas. When Yuyudhana,<br>however, entered the army, the troops (opposed to him) fled away. At<br>this, wrathful Kritavarman came forward to resist Satyaki. The valiant<br>Satyaki striking the advancing Kritavarman with six shafts, quickly slew<br>his four steeds with four other shafts. And once again, he pierced<br>Kritavarman in the centre of the chest with four other shafts. And once<br>again, he pierced Kritavarman in the centre of the chest with sixteen<br>straight shafts of great speed. Thus encountered; O monarch; with many<br>shafts of fierce energy by him of the Satwata race, Kritavarman was<br>unable to brook it. Aiming then a calf-toothed shaft resembling a shake<br>of virulent poison and endued With the speed of the wind, and drawing the<br>bow-string, O monarch, to his ear, he pierced Satyaki in the chest. That<br>shaft, equipped with beautiful feathers, penetrating through his armour<br>and body, and dyed in blood, entered the earth. Then, O king,<br>Kritavarman, that warrior equipped with the highest weapons, shooting<br>many shafts, cut off the bow of Satyaki with arrows fixed thereon. And<br>excited with rage, he then, in that battle, O king, pierced Satyaki of<br>unbaffled prowess in the centre of the chest with ten shafts of great<br>keenness. Upon his bow being broken, the foremost of mighty men, viz.,<br>Satyaki, hurled a dart at the right arm of Kritavarman. And taking up and<br>drawing a tougher bow, Yuyudhana quickly shot at his foe, shafts by<br>hundreds and thousands and entirely shrouded Kritavarman and his car with<br>that arrowy downpour. Having thus shrouded the son of Hridika, O monarch,<br>in that battle, Satyaki cut of, with a broad-headed arrow, the head of<br>his foe's charioteer from his trunk. The charioteer of Hridika's son<br>then, thus slain, fell down from that great car. At this, the steeds of<br>Kritavarman, deprived of a driver, ran away with great speed. The ruler<br>of the Bhojas, then, in great agitation, himself checked those steeds.<br>That heroic warrior then, bow in hand, stood upon his car (ready for<br>battle). Beholding this feat, his troops applauded it highly. Resting for<br>a short space of time, Kritavarman then urged those good steeds of his.<br>Himself devoid of fear, he inspired his foes with great fear. Satyaki,<br>however, had by that time, left him behind, while Kritavarman himself now<br>rushed against Bhimasena without pursuing Satyaki. Thus issuing out of<br>the division of the Bhojas, Satyaki proceeded with great speed towards<br>the mighty division of the Kamvojas. Resisted there by many brave and<br>mighty car-warriors, Yuyudhana, of prowess incapable of being thwarted,<br>could not then, O monarch, proceed a step. Meanwhile, Drona, having<br>placed his troops in a proper position and made over the burthen of their<br>protection to the ruler of the Bhojas, firmly resolved, proceeded with<br>great speed towards Yuyudhana from desire of battle. Then the foremost<br>warriors of the Pandava host, beholding Drona thus pursuing Yuyudhana<br>from behind, cheerfully began to resist him. The Panchalas, however, who<br>were headed by Bhimasena, having approached the son of Hridika, that<br>foremost of car-warriors, all became cheerless. The heroic Kritavarman, O<br>king, displaying his prowess, resisted all those warriors who, although<br>they had become a little heartless, struggled yet with great vigour.<br>Fearlessly he weakened, by means of his arrowy showers, the animals of<br>his foes. The brave warriors, however, (of the Pandava army), though thus<br>afflicted by the ruler of the Bhojas, stood, like high-born soldiers that<br>they were, resolved to fight with the division of the Bhojas itself, from<br>a desire of great renown.'"
