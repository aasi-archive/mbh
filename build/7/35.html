                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding his army routed by Subhadra's son of<br>immeasurable energy, Duryodhana, filled with rage, himself proceeded<br>against the former. Seeing the king turn back towards Subhadra's son in<br>battle, Drona, addressing all the (Kaurava) warriors, said, 'Rescue the<br>king.[65] Before us, in our very sight, the valiant Abhimanyu is slaying<br>all he aims at. Rush ye, therefore, speedily against him, without fear<br>and protect the Kuru king.' Then many grateful and mighty warriors,<br>having Duryodhana's good at heart, and always graced with victory,<br>inspired with fear, surrounded thy son. And Drona, and Drona's son, and<br>Kripa and Karna and Kritavarman and Suvala's son, Vrihadvala, and the<br>ruler of the Madras, and Bhuri, and Bhurisravas, and Sala, and Paurava<br>and Vrishasena, shooting sharp shafts, checked Subhadra's son by means of<br>those arrowy showers. Confounding him with those showers of shafts, they<br>rescued Duryodhana. The son of Arjuna, however, brooked not that act of<br>snatching a morsel from his mouth. Covering those mighty car-warriors,<br>their charioteers, and steeds with thick showers of arrows and causing<br>them to turn back, the son of Subhadra uttered a leonine roar. Hearing<br>that roar of his, resembling that of a lion hungering after prey, these<br>angry car-warriors, headed by Drona, brooked it not. Encompassing him on<br>all sides, O sire, with a large body of cars they shot at him showers of<br>diverse kinds of arrows. The grandson, however, cut them off in the<br>welkin (before any of them could reach him) by means of sharp shafts, and<br>then pierced all of them with his shafts. That feat of his seemed<br>exceedingly wonderful. Provoked by him thus by means of those shafts of<br>his that resembled snakes of virulent poison, they surrounded that<br>unretreating son of Subhadra, desirous of slaying him. That sea of<br>(Kaurava) troops, however, O bull of Bharata's race, the son of Arjuna<br>singly held in check by means of his shafts, like the continent resisting<br>the surging ocean. And among those heroes thus fighting with and striking<br>one another, viz., Abhimanyu and his man on one side and all those<br>warriors together on the other, none turned back from the field. In that<br>dreadful and fierce battle, Duhsaha pierced Abhimanyu with nine shafts.<br>And Duhsasana pierced him with a dozen; and Saradwata's son Kripa, with<br>three. And Drona pierced him with seventeen shafts, each resembling a<br>snake of virulent poison. And Vivinsati, pierced him with seventy shafts,<br>and Kritavarman with seven. And Vrihadvala pierced him with eight, and<br>Aswatthaman with seven shafts. And Bhurisrava pierced him with three<br>shafts and the ruler of the Madras with six. And Sakuni pierced him with<br>two, and king Duryodhana with three shafts. The valiant Abhimanyu,<br>however, O king, seemingly dancing on his car, pierced each of those<br>warriors in return with three shafts. Then Abhimanyu, filled with rage in<br>consequence of thy sons' endeavouring to frighten him thus, displayed the<br>wonderful strength he had acquired from culture and practice. Borne by<br>his well-broken steeds, endued with the speed of Garuda or the Wind, and<br>thoroughly obedient to the behests of him who held their reins, he<br>quickly checked the heir of Asmaka. Staying before him, the handsome son<br>of Asmaka, endued with great might, pierced him with ten shafts and<br>addressing him, said, 'Wait, Wait.' Abhimanyu then, with ten shafts, cut<br>off the former's steeds and charioteer and standard and two arms and bow<br>and head, and caused them to fall down on the earth, smiling the while.<br>After the heroic ruler of the Asmakas had thus been slain by the son of<br>Subhadra, the whole of his force wavered and began to fly away from the<br>field. Then Karna and Kripa, and Drona and Drona's son, and the ruler of<br>the Gandharas, and Sala and Salya, and Bhurisravas and Kratha, and<br>Somadatta, and Vivinsati, and Vrishasena, and Sushena, and Kundavedhin,<br>and Pratardana, and Vrindaraka and Lalithya, and Pravahu, and<br>Drighalochana, and angry Duryodhana, showered their arrows upon him. Then<br>Abhimanyu, excessively pierced by those great bowmen with their straight<br>shafts, shot shafts at Karna which was capable of piercing through every<br>armour and body. That shaft, piercing through Karna's coat of mail and<br>then his body, entered the earth like a snake piercing through an<br>anthill. Deeply pierced, Karna felt great pain and became perfectly<br>helpless. Indeed, Karna began to tremble in that battle like a hill<br>during an earthquake. Then with three other shafts of great sharpness,<br>the mighty son of Arjuna, excited with rage, slew those three warriors,<br>viz., Sushena, Drighalochana, and Kundavedhin. Meanwhile, Karna<br>(recovering from the shock) pierced Abhimanyu with five and twenty<br>shafts. And Aswatthaman struck him with twenty, and Kritavarman with<br>seven. Covered all over with arrows, that son of Sakra's son, filled with<br>rage, careered over the field. And he was regarded by all the troops as<br>Yama's self armed with the noose. He then scattered over Salya, who<br>happened to be near him thick showers of arrows. That mighty-armed<br>warrior then uttered loud shouts, frightening thy troops therewith.<br>Meanwhile, Salya, pierced by Abhimanyu accomplished in weapons, with<br>straight shafts penetrating into his very vitals, sat down on the terrace<br>of his car and fainted away. Beholding Salya thus pierced by the<br>celebrated son of Subhadra, all the troops fled away in the very sight of<br>Bharadwaja's son. Seeing that mighty-armed warrior, viz., Salya, thus<br>covered with shafts of golden wings, thy army fled away like a head of<br>deer attacked by a lion. And Abhimanyu glorified by the Pitris, the gods,<br>and Charanas, and Siddhas, as also by diverse classes of creatures on the<br>earth, with praises about (his heroism and skill in) battle, looked<br>resplendent like a sacrificial fire fed with clarified butter.'"
