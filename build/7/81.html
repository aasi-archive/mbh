                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then Partha, with a cheerful soul and joined hands and<br>eyes expanded (in wonder), gazed at the god having the bull for his mark<br>and who was the receptacle of every energy. And he beheld the offerings<br>he made every night to Vasudeva lying by the side of the Three-eyed<br>deity. The son of Pandu then, mentally worshipping both Krishna and<br>Sarva, said unto the latter, 'I desire (to obtain) the celestial weapon.'<br>Hearing these words of Partha desiring the boon he sought, god Siva<br>smilingly said unto Vasudeva and Arjuna, 'Welcome to you, ye foremost of<br>men! I know the wish cherished by you, and the business for which you<br>have come here. I will give you what you wish. There is a celestial lake<br>full of Amrita, not far from this place, ye slayers of foes! There were<br>kept some time back, that celestial bow and arrow of mine. With them I<br>slew in battle all the enemies of the gods. Bring hither, ye Krishna,<br>that excellent bow with arrow fixed on it.' Hearing these words of Siva,<br>Vasudava with Arjuna answered, 'So be it.' And then accompanied by all<br>the attendants of Siva, those two heroes set out for that celestial lake<br>which possessed hundreds of heavenly wonders, that sacred lake, capable<br>of granting every object, which the god, having the bull for his mark,<br>had indicated to them, And unto that lake, the Rishis Nara and Narayana<br>(viz., Arjuna and Vasudeva) went fearlessly. And having reached that<br>lake, bright as the disc of the sun, Arjuna and Achyuta beheld within its<br>waters a terrible snake. And they beheld there another foremost of<br>snakes, that had a thousand heads. And possessed of the effulgence of<br>fire, that snake was vomiting fierce flames. Then Krishna and Partha<br>having touched water, joined their hands, and approached those snakes,<br>having bowed unto the god having the bull for his mark. And as they<br>approached the snakes, conversant as they were with the Vedas, they<br>uttered the hundred stanzas of the Veda, to the praise of Rudra, bowing<br>the while with their sincere souls unto Bhava of immeasurable power. Then<br>those two terrible snakes, in consequence of the power of those<br>adorations to Rudra, abandoned their snake-forms and assumed the forms of<br>a foe-killing bow and arrow. Gratified (with what they saw), Krishna and<br>Arjuna then seized that bow and arrow of great effulgence. And those<br>high-souled heroes then brought them away and gave them unto the<br>illustrious Mahadeva. Then from one of the sides of Siva's body there<br>came out a Brahmacharin of tawny eyes. And he seemed to be the refuge of<br>asceticism. Of blue throat and red locks, he was endued with great might.<br>Taking up that best of bows that Brahmacharin stood placing (both the bow<br>and his feet properly). And fixing the arrow on the bowstring, he began<br>to stretch the latter duly. Beholding the manner of his seizing the<br>handle of the bow and drawing the string and placing of his feet, and<br>hearing also the Mantras uttered by Bhava, the son of Pandu, of<br>inconceivable prowess, learnt everything duly. The mighty and puissant<br>Brahmacharin then sped that arrow to that same lake. And he once more<br>threw that bow also in that self-same lake. Then Arjuna of good memory<br>knowing that Bhava was gratified with him, and remembering also the boon<br>the latter had given him in the forest, and the sight also he gave him of<br>his person, mentally entertained the desire, 'Let all this become<br>productive of fruit!' Understanding this to be his wish, Bhava, gratified<br>with him, gave him the boon. And the god also granted him the terrible<br>Pasupata weapon and the accomplishment of his vow. Then having thus once<br>more obtained the Pasupata weapon from the supreme god, the invincible<br>Arjuna, with hair standing on end, regarded his business to be already<br>achieved. Then Arjuna and Krishna filled with joy, paid their adorations<br>unto the great god by bowing their heads. And permitted by Bhava both<br>Arjuna and Kesava, those two heroes, almost immediately came back to<br>their own camp, filled with transports of delight. Indeed, their joy was<br>as great as that of Indra and Vishnu when those two gods, desirous of<br>slaying Jambha, obtained the permission of Bhava that slayer of great<br>Asuras.'"
