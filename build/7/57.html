                            "Narada said, 'The heroic king Paurava also, O Srinjaya, we hear, fell a<br>prey to death. That king gave away a thousand times thousand horses that<br>were all white in hue. At the Horse-sacrifice performed by that royal<br>sage, countless number of learned Brahmanas versed in the principles of<br>Siksha[94] and Akshara come from diverse realms. These Brahmanas,<br>purified by the Vedas, by knowledge, and by vows, and liberal and of<br>agreeable countenances, having obtained from the king costly gifts, such<br>as, robes and houses and excellent beds and carpets and vehicles and<br>draft-cattle, were always delighted by actors and dancers and singers,<br>thoroughly competent and well-versed (in their respective art), engaged<br>in spot and ever-striving for their diversion. At each of his Sacrifices<br>in due time he gave away as sacrificial presents ten thousand elephants<br>of golden splendour, with the temporal juice trickling down their bodies,<br>and cars made of gold with standards and banners. He also gave away, as<br>sacrificial presents, a thousand times thousand maidens decked with<br>ornaments of gold, and cars and steeds and elephants for mounting, and<br>houses and fields, and hundreds of kine, by hundreds of thousand, and<br>thousands of cowherds decked with gold. They that are acquainted with the<br>history of the past, sing this song, viz., that in that sacrifice, king<br>Paurava gave away kine with calves, having golden horns and silver hoofs<br>and brass milkpots, and female slaves and male slaves and asses and<br>camels, and sheep, countless in number, and diverse kinds of gems and<br>diverse hill-like mounds of food. That sacrificing king of the Angas<br>successively performed, in the order of their merit, and according to<br>what was competent for his own class, many auspicious sacrifices capable<br>of yielding every object of desire. When such a king, O Srinjaya, died<br>who was superior to thee as regards the four cardinal virtues and who,<br>superior to thee was, therefore, much more superior to thy son, thou<br>shouldst not, saying 'Oh, Swaitya, Oh, Swaitya,' grieve for thy son who<br>performed no sacrifice and made no sacrificial present.'"
