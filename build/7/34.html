                            "Sanjaya said, 'Hearing these words of the intelligent Yudhishthira, the<br>son of Subhadra, O Bharata, urged his charioteer towards Drona's array.<br>The charioteer, urged by him with the words, 'Proceed, Proceed,' replied<br>unto Abhimanyu, O king, in these words, 'O thou that art blest with<br>length of days, heavy is the burthen that hath been placed upon thee by<br>the Pandavas! Ascertaining by thy judgment as to whether thou art able to<br>bear it or not, thou shouldst then engage in battle. The preceptor Drona<br>is a master of superior weapons and accomplished (in battle). Thou,<br>however, hast been brought up in great luxury and art unused to battle.'<br><br>"Hearing these words, Abhimanyu replied unto his charioteer, saying with<br>a laugh, 'O charioteer, who is this Drona? What, again, is this vast<br>assemblage of Kshatriyas? Sakra himself on his Airavata and aided by all<br>the celestials, I would encounter in battle. I do not feel the slightest<br>anxiety about all these Kshatriyas today. This hostile army doth not come<br>up to even a sixteen part of myself. O son of a Suta, getting my maternal<br>uncle Vishnu himself, the conqueror of the universe or my sire, Arjuna,<br>as an antagonist in battle, fear would not enter my heart.' Abhimanyu<br>then, thus disregarding those words of the charioteer, urged the latter,<br>saying, 'Go with speed towards the army of Drona.' Thus commanded, the<br>charioteer, with a heart scarcely cheerful, urged Abhimanyu's three-year<br>old steeds, decked with golden trappings. Those coursers, urged by<br>Sumitra towards Drona's army, rushed towards Drona himself, O king, with<br>great speed and prowess. Beholding him coming (towards them) in that way,<br>al! the Kauravas, headed by Drona, advanced against him, as, indeed, the<br>Pandavas followed him behind. Then Arjuna's son, superior to Arjuna's<br>self eased in golden mail and owning an excellent standard that bore the<br>device of a Karnikara tree, fearlessly encountered, from desire of<br>battle, warriors headed by Drona, like a lion-cub assailing a herd of<br>elephants. Those warriors then, filled with joy, began to strike<br>Abhimanyu while he endeavoured to pierce their array. And for a moment an<br>agitation took place there, like to the eddy that is seen in the ocean<br>where the current of the Ganga mingles with it. The battle, O king, that<br>commenced there, between those struggling heroes striking one another,<br>became fierce and terrible. And during the progress of that awful battle,<br>Arjuna's son, in the very sight of Drona, breaking that array, penetrated<br>into it. Then large bodies of elephants and steeds and cars and infantry,<br>filled with joy, encompassed that mighty warrior after he had thus<br>penetrated into the midst of the foe, and commenced to smite him.<br>[Causing the earth to resound] with noise of diverse musical instruments,<br>with shouts and slaps of arm-pits and roars, with yells and leonine<br>shouts, with exclamations of 'Wait, Wait,' with fierce confused voices<br>with cries of, 'Do not go, Wait, Come to me', with repeated exclamations<br>of, 'This one, It is I, The foe,' with grunt of elephants, with the<br>tinkling of bells and ornaments, with bursts of laughter, and the clatter<br>of horse-hoofs and car-wheels, the (Kaurava) warriors rushed at the son<br>of Arjuna. That mighty hero, however, endued with great lightness of<br>hands and having a knowledge of the vital parts of the body, quickly<br>shooting weapons capable of penetrating into the very vitals, stew those<br>advancing warriors. Slaughtered by means of sharp shafts of diverse<br>kinds, those warriors became perfectly helpless, and like insects falling<br>upon a blazing fire, they continued to fall upon Abhimanyu on the field<br>of battle. And Abhimanyu strewed the earth with their bodies and diverse<br>limbs of their bodies like priests strewing the altar at a sacrifice with<br>blades of Kusa grass. And Arjuna's son cut off by thousands the arms of<br>those warriors. And some of these were eased in corslets made of iguana<br>skin and some held bows and shafts, and some held swords or shields or<br>iron hooks and reins; and some, lances of battle axes. And some held<br>maces or iron balls or spears and some, rapiers and crow-bars and axes.<br>And some grasped short arrows, or spiked maces, or darts, or Kampanas.<br>And some had goads and prodigious conchs; and some bearded darts and<br>Kachagrahas. And some had mallets and some other kinds of missiles. And<br>some had nooses, and some heavy clubs, and some brickbats. And all those<br>arms were decked with armlets and laved with delightful perfumes and<br>unguents. And with those arms dyed with gore and looking bright the field<br>of battle became beautiful, as if strewn, O sire, with five-headed snakes<br>slain by Garuda. And Phalguni's son also scattered over the field of<br>battle countless heads of foes, heads graced with beautiful noses and<br>faces and locks, without pimples, and adorned with ear-rings. Blood<br>flowed from those heads copiously, and the nether-lips in all were bit<br>with wrath. Adorned with beautiful garlands and crowns and turbans and<br>pearls and gems, and possessed of splendour equal to that of the sun or<br>the moon, they seemed to be like lotuses severed from their stalks.<br>Fragrant with many perfumes, while life was in them, they could speak<br>words both agreeable and beneficial. Diverse cars, well-equipped, and<br>looking like the vapoury edifices in the welkin, with shafts in front and<br>excellent bamboo poles and looking beautiful with the standards set up on<br>them, were deprived of their Janghas, and Kuvaras, and Nemis, and<br>Dasanas, and wheels, and standards and terraces. And the utensils of war<br>in them were all broken.[64] And the rich clothes with which they were<br>overlaid, were blown away, and the warriors on them were slain by<br>thousands. Mangling everything before him with his shafts, Abhimanyu was<br>seen coursing on all sides. With his keen-edged weapons, he cut into<br>pieces elephant-warriors, and elephants with standards and hooks and<br>banners, and quivers and coats of mail, and girths and neck-ropes and<br>blankets, and bells and trunks and tusks as also the foot-soldiers that<br>protected those elephants from behind. And many steeds of the Vanayu, the<br>hilly, the Kamvoja, and the Valhika breeds, with tails and ears and eyes<br>motionless and fixed, possessed of great speed, well-trained, and ridden<br>by accomplished warriors armed with swords and lances, were seen to be<br>deprived of the excellent ornaments on their beautiful tails. And many<br>lay with tongues lolling out and eyes detached from their sockets, and<br>entrails and livers drawn out. And the riders on their backs lay lifeless<br>by their sides. And the rows of bells that adorned them were all torn.<br>Strewn over the field thus, they caused great delight to Rakshasas and<br>beasts of prey. With coats of mail and other leathern armour (casing<br>their limbs) cut open, they weltered in excreta ejected by themselves.<br>Thus slaying many foremost of steeds of thy army, Abhimanyu looked<br>resplendent. Alone achieving the most difficult feat, like the<br>inconceivable Vibhu himself in days of old, Abhimanyu crushed thy vast<br>host of three kinds of forces (cars, elephants, and steeds), like the<br>three-eyed (Mahadeva) of immeasurable energy crushing the terrible Asura<br>host. Indeed, Arjuna's son, having achieved in battle feats incapable of<br>being borne by his foes, everywhere mangled large divisions of<br>foot-soldiers belonging to thy army. Beholding then thy host extensively<br>slaughtered by Subhadra's son single-handed with his whetted shafts like<br>the Asura host by Skanda (the celestial generalissimo), thy warriors and<br>thy sons cast vacant looks on all sides. Their mouths became dry; their<br>eyes became restless; their bodies were covered with sweat; and their<br>hairs stood on their ends. Hopeless of vanquishing their foe, they set<br>their hearts on flying away from the field. Desirous of saving their<br>lives, called one another by their names and the names of their families,<br>and abandoning their wounded sons and sires and brothers and kinsmen and<br>relatives by marriage lying around on the field, they endeavoured to fly<br>away, urging their steeds and elephants (to their utmost speed).'"
