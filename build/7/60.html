                            "Narada said, 'Even king Bhagiratha, O Srinjaya, we hear, was dead. He<br>caused the shores of Ganga, called after his name Bhagirath to be covered<br>with flights of steps made of gold.[99] Surpassing all kings and all<br>princes, he gave unto the Brahmanas a thousand times thousand damsels<br>decked with ornaments of gold. All those damsels were upon cars. And unto<br>every car were yoked four steeds, and behind each car were a hundred<br>kine. And behind each cow were (many) goats and sheep. King Bhagiratha<br>gave enormous presents at his sacrifices. For that reason a large<br>concourse of men assembled there. Afflicted there with Ganga was much<br>pained. 'Protect Me,' she said and sat down on his lap. And because Ganga<br>thus sat upon his lap in days of old, therefore, she, like the celestial<br>dancer Urvasi came to be regarded as his daughter and was named after his<br>name. And having become the king's daughter, she became his son (by<br>becoming like a son, the means of salvation unto his deceased<br>ancestors).[100] Sweet-speeched Gandharvas of celestial splendour,<br>gratified, sang all this in the hearing of the Rishis, the gods, and<br>human beings.[101] Thus, O Srinjaya, did that goddess, viz., the<br>ocean-going Ganga, select lord Bhagiratha, descendant of Ikshvaku, the<br>performer of sacrifices with profuse gifts (to the Brahmanas), as her<br>father. His sacrifices were always graced with (the presence of) the very<br>gods with Indra at their head. And the gods used to take their respective<br>shares, by removing all impediments, to facilitate those sacrifices in<br>every way. Possessed of great ascetic merit, Bhagiratha gave unto the<br>Brahmanas whatever benefit they desired without obliging them to stir<br>from the place wherever they might entertain those desires. There was<br>nothing which he could withhold from the Brahmanas. Every one received<br>from him everything he coveted. At last, the king ascended to the region<br>of Brahman, through the grace of the Brahmanas. For that object on which<br>the Rishis that subsisted on the rays of the sun used to wait upon the<br>sun and the presiding deity of the sun, for that very object they used to<br>wait upon the lord Bhagiratha, that ornament of the three worlds. When he<br>died, O Srinjaya, who was superior to thee, as regards the four cardinal<br>virtues, and who, superior to thee, was much superior to thy son, thou<br>shouldst not grieve, saying 'Oh, Swaitya, Oh, Swaitya,' for the latter<br>who performed no sacrifice and made no sacrificial present.'"
