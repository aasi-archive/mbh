                            "Sanjaya said, 'At this time Duryodhana, under the influence of wrath,<br>approached Drona and addressing him said these words, for inspiring him<br>with joy and provoking his anger.'<br><br>"Duryodhana said, 'No mercy should have been shown to our foes while they<br>were heartless and worn out with toil and taking rest, especially when<br>they are all of sure aim. Desirous of doing what is agreeable to thee, we<br>showed them kindness by then letting them alone. The tired Pandavas,<br>however (having taken rest), have become stronger. As regards ourselves,<br>we are, in every respect, losing in energy and strength. The Pandavas,<br>protected by thee, are constantly gaining prosperity. All weapons that<br>are celestial and all those that appertain to Brahma exist in thee. I<br>tell thee truly, that neither the Pandavas, nor ourselves, nor any other<br>bowmen in the world, can be a match for thee while thou art engaged in<br>battle. O foremost of regenerate ones, thou art acquainted with all<br>weapons. Without doubt, by means of thy celestial weapons thou art<br>capable of destroying the (three) worlds with the gods, the Asuras, and<br>the Gandharvas. The Pandavas are all afraid of thee. Thou, however,<br>forgivest them, remembering that they were thy pupils, or, perhaps, owing<br>to my ill luck.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus rebuked and angered by thy son, Drona, O king,<br>wrathfully addressed Duryodhana and said these words: 'Although I am so<br>old, O Duryodhana, I am still exerting myself in battle to the utmost<br>extent of might. All these men are unacquainted with weapons. I am,<br>however, well-versed in them. If, from desire of victory, I slay these<br>men, there can be no more ignoble act for me to do. That, however, which<br>is in thy mind, be it good or bad, I will accomplish, O Kaurava, at thy<br>command. It will not be otherwise. Putting forth my prowess in battle and<br>slaying all the Panchalas, I will doff my armour, O king! I swear this to<br>thee truly. Thou thinkest that Arjuna, the son of Kunti, was worn out in<br>battle. O mighty-armed Kaurava! Listen to what I truly say regarding his<br>prowess. If Savyasachin's wrath is excited, neither Gandharvas, nor<br>Yakshas nor Rakshasas can venture to bear him. At Khandavas, he<br>encountered the divine chief of the celestials himself. The illustrious<br>Arjuna, with his shafts baffled the pouring Indra. Yakshas, and Nagas,<br>and Daityas, and all others proud of their might, were slain by that<br>foremost of men. That also is known to thee. On the occasion of the tale<br>of cattle, the Gandharvas headed by Chitrasena and others were vanquished<br>by him. That firm bowman rescued you, while you were being carried away<br>by those Gandharvas. Nivatakavachas also, those enemies of the<br>celestials, that were unslayable in battle by the celestials, themselves,<br>were vanquished by that hero. Thousands of Danavas dwelling in<br>Hiranyapura, that tiger among men vanquished. How can human beings then<br>withstand him? O monarch, thou hast seen with thy own eyes how this host<br>of thine, although exerting themselves so heroically, hath been destroyed<br>by the son of Pandu.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Unto Drona who was thus applauding Arjuna, thy son,<br>O king, angered thereat, once more said these words: 'Myself and<br>Duhsasana, and Karna, and my maternal uncle, Sakuni, dividing this<br>Bharata host into two divisions (and taking one with us), shall to-day<br>slay Arjuna in battle.' 'Hearing these words of his, Bharadwaja's son,<br>laughing, sanctioned that speech of the king and said, 'Blessings to<br>thee! What Kshatriya is there that would slay that bull amongst<br>Kshatriyas, that unslayable one, viz., the bearer of Gandiva, that hero<br>blazing forth with energy? Neither the Lord of treasures, nor Indra, nor<br>Yama, nor the Asuras, the Uragas, and the Rakshasas can stay Arjuna armed<br>with weapons. Only they that are fools say such words as those thou hast<br>said, O Bharata! Who is there that would return home in safety, having<br>encountered Arjuna in battle? As regards thyself, thou art sinful and<br>cruel and suspicious of everybody. Even them that are employed in thy<br>welfare, thou art ready to rebuke in this way. Go thou against the son of<br>Kunti, for withstanding him for thy own sake. Thou art a well-born<br>Kshatriya. Thou seekest battle. Why dost thou cause all these unoffending<br>Kshatriyas to be slain? Thou art the root of this hostility. Therefore,<br>go thou against Arjuna. This thy maternal uncle is possessed of wisdom<br>and observant of Kshatriya duties. O son of Gandhari, let this one<br>addicted to gambling proceed against Arjuna in battle. This one, skilled<br>in dice, wedded to deception, addicted to gambling, versed in cunning and<br>imposture, this gambler conversant with the ways of deceiving, will<br>vanquish the Pandavas in battle! With Karna in thy company, thou hadst<br>often joyfully boasted, from folly and emptiness of understanding, in the<br>hearing of Dhritarashtra, saying, 'O sire, myself, and Karna, and my<br>brother Duhsasana, these three, uniting together, will slay the sons of<br>Pandu in battle.' This thy boast was heard in every meeting of the court.<br>Accomplish thy vow, be truthful in speech, with them. There thy mortal<br>foe, the son of Pandu, is staying before thee. Observe the duties of a<br>Kshatriya. Thy slaughter at the hands of Jaya would be worthy of every<br>praise. Thou hast practised charity. Thou hast eaten (everything ever<br>desired by thee). Thou hast obtained wealth to the measure of thy wish.<br>Thou hast no debts. Thou hast done all that one should do. Do not fear.<br>Fight now with the son of Pandu.' These words said, the battle<br>commenced.'"
