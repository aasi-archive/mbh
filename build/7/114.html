                            "Sanjaya said, 'Listen with undivided attention, O king. After the rout<br>of that force by the high-souled son of Hridika, and upon the Parthas<br>being humiliated with shame and thy troops elated with joy, he that<br>became protector of the Pandavas who were solicitous of protection while<br>sinking in that fathomless sea of distress, that hero, viz., the grandson<br>of Sini, hearing that fierce uproar, of thy army in that terrible fight,<br>quickly turned back and proceeded against Kritavarman. Hridika's son,<br>Kritavarman, then excited with wrath, covered the grandson of Sini with<br>clouds of sharp shafts. At this, Satyaki also became filled with rage.<br>The grandson of Sini then quickly sped at Kritavarman a sharp and<br>broad-headed arrow in the encounter and then four other arrows. These<br>tour arrows slew the steeds of Kritavarman, and the other cut off<br>Kritavarman's bow. Then Satyaki pierced the charioteer of his foe and<br>those that protected the latter's rear, with many keen shafts, to afflict<br>his antagonist's forces. The hostile division then, afflicted with<br>Satyaki's arrows, broke down. Thereupon, Satyaki of prowess incapable of<br>being baffled, quickly proceeded on his way. Hear now, O king, what that<br>hero of great valour then did unto thy troops. Having, O monarch, forded<br>the ocean constituted by Drona's division, and filled with joy at having<br>vanquished Kritavarman in battle, that hero then addressed his<br>charioteer, saying, 'Proceed slowly without fear.' Beholding, however,<br>that army of thine that abounded with cars, steeds, elephants and<br>foot-soldiers, Satyaki once more told his charioteer, 'That large<br>division which thou seest on left of Drona's host, and which looks dark<br>as the clouds, consists of the elephants (of the foe). Rukmaratha is its<br>leader. Those elephants are many, O charioteer, and are difficult of<br>being resisted in battle. Urged by Duryodhana, they wait for me, prepared<br>to cast away their lives. All those combatants are of princely birth, and<br>great bowmen, and capable of displaying great prowess in battle,<br>belonging to the country of the Trigartas, they are all illustrious<br>car-warriors, owning standards decked with gold. Those brave warriors are<br>waiting, desirous of battle with me. Urge the steeds quickly, O<br>charioteer and take me thither. I shall fight with the Trigartas in the<br>very sight of Bharadwaja's son.' Thus addressed, the charioteer, obedient<br>to Satwata's will, proceeded slowly. Upon that bright car of solar<br>effulgence, equipped with standard, those excellent steeds harnessed<br>thereto and perfectly obedient to the driver, endued with speed of the<br>wind, white as the Kunda flower, or the moon, or silver, bore him (to<br>that spot). As he advanced to battle, drawn by those excellent steeds of<br>the hue of a conch, those brave warriors encompassed him on all sides<br>with their elephants, scattering diverse kinds of keen arrows capable of<br>easily piercing everything. Satwata also fought with that elephant<br>division, shooting his keen shafts, like a mighty cloud at the end of<br>summer pouring torrents of rain on a mountain breast. Those elephants<br>slaughtered with those shafts, whose touch resembled thunder sped by that<br>foremost one among the Sinis began to fly away from the field, their<br>tusks broken, bodies covered with blood, heads and frontal globes split<br>open, ears and faces and trunks cut off, and themselves deprived of<br>riders, and standards cut down, riders slain, and blankets loosened, ran<br>away, O king, in all directions. Many amongst them, O monarch, mangled by<br>Satwata with long shafts and calf-tooth-headed arrows and broad-headed<br>arrows and Anjalikas and razor-faced arrows and crescent-shaped ones fled<br>away, with blood flowing down their bodies, and themselves ejecting urine<br>and excreta and uttering loud and diverse cries, deep as the roar of<br>clouds. And some amongst the others wandered, and some limped, and some<br>fell down, and some became pale and cheerless. Thus afflicted by<br>Yuyudhana, with shafts that resembled the sun or fire, that elephant<br>division fled away in all directions. After that elephant division was<br>exterminated, the mighty Jalasandha, exerting himself coolly, led his<br>elephant before Yuyudhana's car drawn by white steeds. Cased in golden<br>Angadas, with ear-rings and diadem, armed with sword, smeared with red<br>sandal-paste, his head encircled with a blazing chain of gold, his breast<br>covered with a cuirass, his neck adorned with a bright chain (of gold),<br>that hero of sinless soul, stationed on the heads of his elephant,<br>shaking his bow decked with gold, looked resplendent, O king, like a<br>cloud charged with lightning. Like the continent resisting the surging<br>sea, Satyaki checked that excellent elephant of the ruler of the Magadhas<br>that approached him with such fury. Beholding the elephant checked by the<br>excellent shafts of Yuyudhana, the mighty Jalasandha became filled with<br>rage. Then, O king, the enraged Jalasandha, pierced Sini's grandson on<br>his broad chest with some shafts of great force. With another sharp and<br>well tempered broad-headed arrow, he cut off the bow of the Vrishni hero<br>while the latter was drawing it. And then, O Bharata, smiling the while,<br>the heroic ruler of the Magadhas pierced the bowless Satyaki with five<br>keen shafts. The valiant and mighty-armed Satyaki, however, though<br>pierced with many shafts by Jalasandha, trembled not in the least. All<br>this seemed exceedingly wonderful. Then mighty Yuyudhana without any<br>fear, thought of the shafts (he should use). Taking up another bow,<br>addressed Jalasandha, saying, 'Wait, Wait!' Saying this much, the<br>grandson of Sini deeply pierced Jalasandha on his broad breast with sixty<br>arrows, smiling the while. And with another razor-faced arrow of great<br>sharpness he cut off Jalasandha's bow at the handle, and with three more<br>shafts he pierced Jalasandha himself. Then Jalasandha, casting aside that<br>bow of his with an arrow fixed thereon, hurled a lance, O sire, at<br>Satyaki. That terrible lance, passing through the left arm of Madhava in<br>fierce battle, entered the earth, like a hissing snake of gigantic<br>proportion. And his left arm had thus been pierced. Satyaki, of prowess<br>incapable of being baffled, struck Jalasandha with thirty keen shafts.<br>Then mighty Jalasandha taking up his scimitar and large shield made of<br>bull's hide and decked with a hundred moons whirled the former for a<br>while and hurled it at Satwata. Cutting off the bow of Sini's grandson,<br>that scimitar fell down on the earth, and looked resplendent like a<br>circle of fire, as it lay on the earth. Then Yuyudhana took up another<br>bow capable of piercing everybody, large as a Sala-offshoot, and of twang<br>resembling the roar of Indra's thunder, and filled with rage, stretched<br>in and then pierced Jalasandha with a single shaft. And then Satyaki,<br>that foremost one of Madhu's race, smiling the while, cut off, with a<br>pair of razor-faced arrows, the two arms, decked with ornaments, of<br>Jalasandha. Thereupon, those two arms, looking like a couple of spiked<br>maces, fell down from that foremost of elephants, like a couple of<br>five-headed snakes falling down from a Mountain. And then, with a third<br>razor-headed arrow, Satyaki cut off his antagonist's large head endued<br>with beautiful teeth and adorned with a pair of beautiful ear-rings. The<br>headless and armless trunk, of fearful aspect, dyed Jalasandha's elephant<br>with blood. Having slain Jalasandha, in battle, Satwata quickly felled<br>the wooden structure, O king, from that elephant's back. Bathed in blood,<br>the elephant of Jalasandha bore that costly seat, hanging down from his<br>back. And afflicted with the arrows of Satwata, the huge beast crushed<br>friendly ranks as it ran wildly, uttering fierce cries of pain. Then, O<br>sire, wails of woe arose among thy troops, at the sight of Jalasandha<br>slain by that bull among the Vrishnis. Thy warriors then, turning their<br>faces, fled away in all directions. Indeed, despairing of success over<br>the foe, they set their hearts on flight. Mean. while, O king, Drona,<br>that foremost of all wielders of bows, approached the mighty car-warrior<br>Yuyudhana, borne by his swift coursers. Many bulls among the Kurus,<br>beholding Sini's grandson swelling (with rage-and pride), rushed at him<br>with fury, accompanied by Drona. Then commenced a battle, O king, between<br>the Kurus and Drona (on one side) and Yuyudhana (on the other), that<br>resembled the awful battle of old between the gods and the Asuras.'"
