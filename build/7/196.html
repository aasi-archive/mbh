                            "Sanjaya said.. 'Hearing of the slaughter of his sire by Dhrishtadyumna,<br>of sinful deeds, Drona's son was filled with grief and rage, O bull among<br>men. Filled with rage, O king, his body seems to blaze forth like that of<br>the Destroyer while engaged in slaughtering creatures at the end of Yuga.<br>Repeatedly wiping his tearful eyes, and breathing hot sighs in rage, he<br>said unto Duryodhana, I have now learnt how my sire has been slain by<br>those low wretches after he laid aside his weapons, and how also has a<br>sinful act been perpetrated by Yudhishthira disguised in the grab of<br>virtue![257] I have now heard of that unrighteous and exceedingly cruel<br>act of Dharma's son. Indeed, to those engaged in battle, either of the<br>two things must happen, viz., victory or defeat. Death in battle is<br>always to be applauded. That death, in battle, of a person engaged in<br>fight, which takes place under circumstances of righteousness, is not<br>deserving of grief, as has been observed by the sages. Without doubt, my<br>sire has gone to the region of heroes. He having met with such a death, I<br>should not grieve for him. The humiliation, however, of a seizure of his<br>locks, that he sustained in the very sight of all the troops, while he<br>was righteously engaged in battle, is tearing the very core of my heart.<br>Myself alive, my sire's locks were seized, why should sonless people then<br>entertain a desire of offspring?[258] People perpetrate unrighteous acts<br>or humiliate others, moved by lust or wrath or folly or hatred or levity.<br>The cruel and wicked-souled son of Prishata hath perpetrated this<br>exceedingly sinful act in total disregard of me Dhrishtadyumna,<br>therefore, shall surely suffer the dreadful consequence of that act, as<br>also the false-speeched son of Pandu, that has acted so wrongly. Today,<br>the earth shall certainly drink the blood of that king Yudhishthira the<br>just, who caused the preceptor, by an act of deceit to lay aside his<br>weapons. I swear by truth, O Kauraveya, as also by my religious acts,<br>that I shall never bear the burden of life if I fail to exterminate the<br>Panchalas. By every means I contend with the Panchalas in dreadful<br>strife. I shall certainly slay in battle Dhrishtadyumna, that perpetrator<br>of unrighteous deeds. Mild or violent, let the means be what they will, I<br>shall effect the destruction of all the Panchalas before peace becomes<br>mine. O Kaurava! O tiger among men, persons desire children so that<br>obtaining them they may be rescued from great fears both here and<br>hereafter. My sire, however, fell unto that plight, like a friendless<br>creature, although myself am alive, his disciple and son, resembling a<br>mountain (in might). Fie on my celestial weapons. Fie on my arms. Fie on<br>my prowess. Since Drona, although he had a son in me, had his locks<br>seized! I shall, therefore, O chief of the Bharatas, now achieve that by<br>which I may be freed from the debt I owe to my sire, now gone to the<br>other world. He that is good never indulges in self-praise. Unable,<br>however, to brook the slaughter of my sire, I speak of my prowess. Let<br>the Pandavas, with Janardana among them, behold my energy today, while I<br>grind all their troops, achieving what is done (by the destroyer himself)<br>at the end of the Yuga. Neither the gods, nor the Gandharvas, nor the<br>Asuras, the Uragas, and the Rakshasas, nor all the foremost of men, shall<br>today be able to vanquish me on my car in battle. There is none in the<br>world equal to me or Arjuna in knowledge of weapons. Entering into the<br>midst of the troops, like the sun himself in the midst of his blazing<br>rays, I shall today use my celestial weapons. Today, applied by me,<br>innumerable shafts, sped from my bow in dreadful battle, displaying their<br>terrible energy, I shall grind the Pandavas. Today, all the points of the<br>compass, O king will be seen by the warriors of our army shrouded with my<br>winged arrows of keen points, as if with torrents of rain. Scattering<br>showers of shafts on all sides with a loud noise, I shall overthrow my<br>foes, like a tempest felling trees. Neither Vibhatsu, nor Janardana, nor<br>Bhimasena, nor Nakula, nor Sahadeva, nor king Yudhishthira, nor<br>Prishata's wicked-souled son (Dhrishtadyumna), nor Sikhandin, nor<br>Satyaki, O Kauravya, knoweth that weapon which I have, along with the<br>mantras, for hurting and withdrawing it. Formerly on one occasion,<br>Narayana, assuming the from of a Brahmana, came to my father. Bowing unto<br>him, my father presented his offerings unto him in due form. Taking them<br>himself, the divine Lord offered to give him a boon. My father then<br>solicited that supreme weapon called Narayana. The divine Lord, the<br>foremost of all gods, addressing my sire, said, No man shall ever become<br>thy equal in battle. This weapon, however, O Brahmana, should never be<br>used in haste. It never comes back without effecting the destruction of<br>the foe. I know none whom it may not slay, O lord! Indeed, It would slay<br>even the unslayable. Therefore, it should not be used (without the<br>greatest deliberation). This mighty weapon, O scorcher of foes, should<br>never be hurled upon persons that abandon their cars or weapons in<br>battle, or upon those that seek for quarter or those that wield<br>themselves up. He who seeketh to afflict in battle the unslayable with<br>it, is himself exceedingly afflicted by it![259]'&#8212;My sire thus received<br>that weapon. Then Lord Narayana, addressing myself also, said, 'With the<br>aid of this weapon, thou too shalt pour diverse showers of celestial<br>weapons in battle and blaze with energy in consequence of it. Having said<br>these words, the divine Lord ascended to heaven. Even this is the history<br>of the Narayana weapon which has been obtained by my sire's son. With<br>that I will rout and slay the Pandavas, the Panchalas, the Matsyas, and<br>the Kaikeyas, in battle, like Sachi's lord routing and slaying the<br>Asuras. My shafts, O Bharata, will fall upon the contending foes, in<br>those particular forms which I shall wish them to assume. Staying in<br>battle, I will pour showers of weapons as I desire. I will rout and slay<br>all the foremost of car warriors with sky-ranging arrows of iron-points.<br>Without doubt, I will shower innumerable battle-axes upon the foe. With<br>the mighty Narayana weapon, a scorcher of foes that I am, I will destroy<br>the Pandavas, causing an immense carnage amongst them. That wretch<br>amongst the Panchalas, (viz., Dhrishtadyumna), who is an injurer of<br>friends and Brahmanas and of his own preceptor, who is a deceitful wretch<br>of the most reprehensible conduct, shall never escape from me today with<br>life.' Hearing these words of Drona's son, the (Kuru) army rallied. Then<br>many foremost of men blew their gigantic conchs. And filled with delight,<br>they beat their drums and dindimas by thousands. The earth resounded with<br>loud noises, afflicted with the hoofs of steeds and the wheels of cars.<br>That loud uproar made the earth, and the firmament also echo with it.<br>Hearing that uproar, deep as the roll of the clouds, the Pandavas, those<br>foremost of car-warriors, uniting together, took counsel of one another.<br>Meanwhile, Drona's son, having said those words, O Bharata, touched water<br>and invoked the celestial weapon called the Narayana.'"
