                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Beholding the grandson of Sini proceeding towards<br>Arjuna, grinding as he went that large force, what, indeed, O Sanjaya,<br>did those shameless sons of mine do? When Yuyudhana who 'is equal to<br>Savyasachin himself was before them, how, indeed, could those wretches,<br>that were at the point of death, set their hearts upon battle? What also<br>did all those Kshatriyas, vanquished in battle, then, do? How, indeed,<br>could Satyaki of world-wide renown pass through them in battle? How also,<br>O Sanjaya, when my sons were alive, could the grandson of Sini go to<br>battle? Tell me all this. This is exceedingly wonderful, O sire, that I<br>have heard from thee, viz., this encounter between one and the many, the<br>latter, again, being all mighty car-warriors. O Suta, I think, Destiny is<br>now unpropitious to my sons, since so many mighty car-warriors have been<br>slain by that one warrior of the Satwata race, Alas, O Sanjaya, my army<br>is no match for even one warrior, viz., Yuyudhana inflamed with wrath.<br>Let all the Pandavas hang up these weapons. Vanquishing in battle Drona<br>himself who skilled in weapons and conversant with all modes of warfare,<br>Satyaki will slay my sons, like a lion slaying smaller animals. Numerous<br>heroes, of whom Kritavarman is the first, contending vigorously in<br>battle, could not slay Yuyudhana. The latter, without doubt, will slay my<br>sons. Phalguna himself fought not in the manner in which the renowned<br>grandson of Sini has fought.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'All this, O king, has been brought about by thy evil<br>counsels and the acts of Duryodhana. Listen attentively to what, O<br>Bharata, I say unto thee. At the command of thy son, the Samsaptakas,<br>rallying, all resolved upon fighting fiercely. Three thousand bowmen<br>headed by Duryodhana, with a number of Sakas and Kamvojas and Valhikas<br>and Yavanas and Paradas, and Kalingas and Tanganas and Amvashtas and<br>Pisachas and Barbaras and mountaineers, O monarch, inflamed with rage and<br>armed with stone, all rushed against the grandson of Sini like insects<br>against a blazing fire. Five hundred other warriors, O king, similarly<br>rushed against Satyaki. And another mighty body consisting of a thousand<br>cars, a hundred great car-warriors, a thousand elephants, two thousand<br>heroes, and countless foot-soldiers, also rushed against the grandson of<br>Sini. Duhsasana, O Bharata, urging all those warriors, saying, 'Slay him,<br>surrounded Satyaki therewith. Grand and wonderful was the conduct that we<br>then beheld of Sini's grandson, inasmuch as alone he fought fearlessly<br>with those innumerable foes. And he slew that entire body of car-warriors<br>and that elephant force, and all those horsemen and that entire body of<br>robbers. Like the autumnal firmament bespangled with stars, the field of<br>battle there became strewn with car-wheels broken and crushed by means of<br>his mighty weapons with innumerable Akshas and beautiful cart-shafts<br>reduced to fragments, with crushed elephants and fallen standards, with<br>coats of mail and shields scattered all about, with garlands and<br>ornaments and robes and Anuskarshas, O sire! Many foremost of elephants,<br>huge as hills, and born of the race of Anjana or Vamana, O Bharata, or of<br>other races, many foremost of tuskers, O king, lay there on the ground,<br>deprived of life. And Satyaki slew, O monarch, many foremost of steeds of<br>the Vanayu, the mountain, the Kamvoja and the Valhika breeds. And the<br>grandson of Sini also slew foot-soldiers there, in hundreds and<br>thousands, born in various realms and belonging to various nations.<br>Whilst those soldiers were being thus slaughtered, Duhsasana, addressing<br>the robbers said, 'Ye warriors unacquainted with morality, fight! Why do<br>you retreat?' Beholding them run away without paying any heed to his<br>words, thy soil Duhsasana urged on the brave mountaineers, skilled in<br>fighting with stones, saying, 'Ye are accomplished in battling with<br>stones. Satyaki is ignorant of this mode of warfare. Stay ye, therefore,<br>that warrior who, though desirous of battle, is ignorant of your mode of<br>fight. The Kauravas also are all unacquainted with this mode of battle.<br>Rush ye at Satyaki. Do not fear. Satyaki will not be able to approach<br>you.' Thus urged, those Kshatriyas dwelling on the mountains, all<br>acquainted with the method of fighting with stones, rushed towards the<br>grandson of Sini like ministers towards a king. Those denizens of the<br>mountain then, with stones huge as elephants' heads uplifted in their<br>hands, stood before Yuyudhana in that battle. Others, urged by thy son,<br>and desirous of slaying Satwata, encompassed the latter on all sides,<br>armed with missiles. Then, Satyaki, aiming at those warriors rushing at<br>him from desire of fighting with stones, sped at them showers of keen<br>shafts. That bull amongst the Sinis, with those shafts looking like<br>snakes, cut into fragments that dense shower of stones thrown by the<br>mountaineers. The fragments of those stones, looking like a swarm of<br>blazing fire-flies, slew many combatants there, whereupon, O sire, cries<br>of oh and alas arose on the field. Then, again, five hundred brave<br>warriors with huge stones uplifted in their hands, fell down, O king, on<br>the ground, their arms cut off. And once more a full thousand, and again<br>a hundred thousand, amongst others, fell down without being able to<br>approach Satyaki, their arms with stones still in grasp cut off by him.<br>Indeed, Satyaki slew many thousands of those warriors fighting with<br>stones. All this seemed exceedingly wonderful. Then many of them,<br>returning to the fight, hurled at Satyaki showers of stones, And armed<br>with swords and lances many Daradas and Tanganas and Khasas and Lampakas<br>and Pulindas, hurled their weapons at him. Satyaki however,<br>well-conversant with the application of weapons, cut off those stones and<br>weapons by means of his shafts. Those stones while being pierced, broken<br>in the welkin by Satyaki's whetted shafts, produced a fierce noise, at<br>which many car-warriors and steeds and elephants fled away from battle.<br>And struck with the fragments of those stones, men and elephants and<br>steeds, became incapable of staying in battle, for they felt as if they<br>were bit by wasps. The small remnant of the elephants (that had attacked<br>Satyaki), covered with blood, their heads, and frontal globes split open,<br>then fled away from, Yuyudhana's car. Then there arose among thy troops,<br>O sire, while they were being thus ground by Madhava a noise like that of<br>the ocean at full tide. Hearing that great uproar, Drona, addressing his<br>charioteer, said, 'O Suta, that great car-warrior of the Satwata race,<br>excited with wrath, is tearing our army into diverse fragments, and<br>careering in battle like the Destroyer himself. Take thou the car to that<br>spot whence this furious uproar is coming. Without doubt, Yuyudhana is<br>engaged with the mountaineers who battle with stones, Our car-warriors<br>are seen also to be borne away by their wildly running steeds. Many<br>amongst them, weaponless and armourless and wounded, are falling down.<br>The charioteers are unable to check their steeds as these are rushing<br>wildly.' Hearing these words of Bharadwaja's son, the charioteer said<br>unto Drona, that foremost of wielders of weapons, 'Thou blest with length<br>of days, the Katirava troops are flying away. Behold, our warriors,<br>routed (by the foe), are flying in all directions. There, again, those<br>heroes, viz., the Panchalas, and the Pandavas, united together, are<br>rushing from all sides from desire of slaughtering thee, O chastiser of<br>foes, do thou determine which of these tasks should first demand<br>attention. Should we stay here (to meet the advancing Pandava), or should<br>we proceed (towards Satyaki)? As regards Satyaki, he is now far ahead of<br>us.' While the charioteer, O sire, was speaking thus unto Bharadwaja's<br>son, the grandson of Sini suddenly appeared to the view, engaged in<br>slaughtering a large number of car-warriors. Those troops of thine, while<br>being thus slaughtered by Yuyudhana, in battle, fled away from<br>Yuyudhana's car towards where Drona's division was. Those (other)<br>car-warriors also with whom Duhsasana had proceeded, all struck with<br>panic, similarly rushed to the spot where Drona's car was seen.
