                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'How, indeed, did that battle take place when at<br>dead of night Vikartana's son, Karna, and the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha<br>encountered each other? What aspect did that fierce Rakshasa then<br>present? What kind of car did he ride, and what was the nature of his<br>steeds and what of his weapons? What was the size of his steeds, of the<br>standard of his car, and of his bow? What was the kind of armour he wore,<br>and what head-gear had he on? Asked by me, describe all this, for thou<br>art skilled in narration, O Sanjaya!'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Of blood-red eyes, Ghatotkacha was of gigantic form. His<br>face was of the hue of copper. His belly was low and sunken. The bristles<br>on his body all pointed upwards. His head was green. His ears were like<br>arrows. His cheek-bones were high. His mouth was large, extending from<br>ear to ear. His teeth were keen, and four of these were high and pointed.<br>His tongue and lips were very long and of a coppery hue. His brows were<br>long-extending. His nose was thick. His body was blue, and neck red. Tall<br>as a hill, he was terrible to behold. Of gigantic frame, gigantic arms,<br>and gigantic head, he was endued with great might. Ugly and of hard<br>limbs, the hair on his head was tied upwards in a frightful shape. His<br>hips were large and his navel was deep. Of gigantic frame, the<br>circumference of his body, however, was not great. The ornaments on his<br>arms were proportionate. Possessed of great powers of illusion, he was<br>decked also in Angadas. He wore a cuirass on his breast like a circle of<br>fire on the breast of a mountain. On his head was a bright and beautiful<br>diadem made of gold, with every part proportionate and beautiful, and<br>looking like an arch. His ear-rings were bright as the morning sun, and<br>his garlands were made of gold and exceedingly bright. He had on his body<br>a gigantic armour of brass of great effulgence. His car was decked with a<br>hundred tinkling bells, and on his standard waved numerous blood-red<br>banners. Of prodigious proportions, and of the measure of a nalwa, that<br>car was covered with bear-skins. Equipped with all kinds of mighty<br>weapons, it possessed a tall standard and was adorned with garlands,<br>having eight wheels, and its clatter resembled the roar of the clouds.<br>His steeds were like infuriated elephants, and possessed of red eyes; of<br>terrible aspect, they were variegated in hue, and endued with great speed<br>and might. Above all fatigue, and adorned with long manes and neighing<br>repeatedly, they bore that hero to battle. A Rakshasa of terrible eyes,<br>fiery mouth, and blazing ear-rings, acted as his driver, holding the<br>reins, bright as the rays of the sun, of his steeds in battle. With that<br>driver he came to battle like Surya with his driver Aruna. Looking like a<br>high mountain encircled with a mighty cloud, a very tall standard, that<br>touched the heavens, was set up on his car. A carnivorous and awful<br>vulture of blood-red body perched on it. He came, forcibly drawing his<br>bow whose twang resembled the thunder of Indra, and whose string was very<br>hard, and which measured a dozen cubits in length and one cubit in<br>breadth.[231] Filling all the points of the compass with shafts of the<br>measure of the Aksha of a car, the Rakshasa rushed against Karna on that<br>night that was so destructive of heroes. Staying proudly on his car, as<br>he stretched his bow, the twang that was heard resembled that sound of<br>the roaring thunder. Frightened by him, O Bharata, all thy troops<br>trembled like the surging waves of the ocean. Beholding that frightful<br>Rakshasa of horrible eyes advancing against him, Radha's son, as if<br>smiling, withstood him speedily. And Karna proceeded against the smiling<br>Rakshasa, smiting him in return from a near point, like an elephant<br>against an elephant or the leader of a bovine herd against the leader of<br>another herd. The collision that took place between them, i.e., Karna and<br>the Rakshasa, O king, became terrible and resembled that between Indra<br>and Samvara. Each taking a formidable bow of loud twang, struck and<br>covered the other with powerful shafts. With straight shafts sped from<br>bows drawn to their fullest stretch, they mangled each other, piercing<br>their coats of mail made of brass. With darts of the measure of Akshas,<br>and shafts also they continued to mangle each other, like a couple of<br>tigers or of mighty elephants with their teeth or tusks. Piercing each<br>other's body, aiming shafts at each other, scorching each other with<br>clouds of arrows, they became incapable of being gazed at. With limbs<br>pierced and mangled with shafts, and bathed in streams of blood, they<br>looked like two hills of chalk with rivulets running down their breasts.<br>Those two mighty car-warriors, both struggling vigorously, both with<br>limbs pierced with keen-pointed shafts, and each mangling the other,<br>failed, however to make each other tremble For a long time, that<br>nocturnal combat between Karna and the Rakshasas in which both seemed to<br>sport, making life itself the stake, continued equally. Aiming keen<br>shafts and shooting them to the utmost measure of his might, the twang of<br>Ghatotkacha's bow inspired both friends and foes with fear.[232] At that<br>time, O king, Karna could not prevail over Ghatotkacha. Seeing this, that<br>foremost of all persons acquainted with weapons, invoked into existence<br>celestial weapons. Beholding a celestial weapon aimed at him by Karna,<br>Ghatotkacha, that foremost of Rakshasas invoked into existence his<br>Rakshasa illusion. He was seen surrounded by a large force of<br>terrible-looking Rakshasas, armed with lances, large rocks and hills and<br>clubs.[233] Beholding Ghatotkacha advancing with a mighty weapon uplifted<br>(in his hands) like unto the Destroyer himself of all creatures armed<br>with his fierce and fatal club, all the kings there were struck with<br>fear. Terrified at the leonine roars uttered by Ghatotkacha, the<br>elephants passed urine all the combatants trembled with fear. Then there<br>fell on all sides a thick rain of rocks and stones poured incessantly by<br>the Rakshasas, who had, in consequence of midnight, became inspired with<br>greater strength.[234] Iron wheels and Bhusundis, and darts, and lances<br>and spears and Sataghnis and axes also began to fall incessantly.<br>Beholding that fierce and terrible battle, all the kings, as also thy<br>sons and the combatants, fled away in fear. Only one amongst them, viz.,<br>Karna, proud of the power of his weapons, and feeling a noble pride,<br>trembled not. Indeed, with his shafts he destroyed that illusion invoked<br>into existence by Ghatotkacha. Beholding his illusion dispelled,<br>Ghatotkacha, filled with rage began to shoot deadly shafts from desire of<br>slaying the Suta's son. Those shafts, bathed in blood, piercing through<br>Karna's body in that dreadful battle, entered the earth like angry<br>snakes. Then the valiant son of the Suta, filled with rage and possessed<br>of great lightness of hands, prevailing over Ghatotkacha, pierced the<br>latter with ten shafts. Then Ghatotkacha, thus pierced by the Suta's son<br>in his vital parts and feeling great pain, took up a celestial wheel<br>having a thousand radii. The edge of that wheel was sharp as a razor.<br>Possessed of the splendour of the morning sun, and decked with jewels and<br>gems, Bhimasena's son hurled that wheel at the son of Adhiratha, desirous<br>of making an end of the latter. That wheel, however, of great power and<br>hurled also with great might, was cut off into pieces by Karna with his<br>shafts, and fell down, baffled of its object, like the hopes and purposes<br>of an unfortunate man. Filled with rage upon beholding his wheel baffled,<br>Ghatotkacha covered Karna with showers of shafts, like Rahu covering the<br>sun. The Suta's son, however, endued with the prowess of Rudra or of<br>Indra's younger brother or of Indra, fearlessly shrouded Ghatotkacha's<br>car in a moment with winged arrows. Then Ghatotkacha, whirling a<br>gold-decked mace, hurled it at Karna. Karna, however, with his shafts,<br>cutting it off, caused it to fall down. Then soaring into the sky and<br>roaring deep like a mass of clouds, the gigantic Rakshasa poured from the<br>welkin a perfect shower of trees. Then Karna pierced with his shafts<br>Bhima's son in the sky, that Rakshasa acquainted with illusions, like the<br>sun piercing with his rays a mass of clouds. Slaying then all the steeds<br>of Ghatotkacha, and cutting also his car into a hundred pieces, Karna<br>began to pour upon him his arrows like a cloud pouring torrents of rain.<br>On Ghatotkacha's body there was not even two finger's breadth of space<br>that was not pierced with Karna's shafts. Soon the Rakshasa seemed to be<br>like a porcupine with quills erect on his body. So completely was he<br>shrouded with shafts that we could not in that battle, any longer see<br>either the steeds or the car or the standard of Ghatotkacha or<br>Ghatotkacha himself. Destroying then by his own weapon, the celestial<br>weapon of Karna, Ghatotkacha, endued with the power of illusion, began to<br>fight with the Suta's son, aided by his powers of illusion. Indeed, he<br>began to fight with Karna, aided by his illusion and displaying the<br>greatest activity. Showers of shafts fell from an invisible source from<br>the welkin. Then Bhimasena's son, endued with great prowess of illusion,<br>O foremost of the Kurus, assumed a fierce from, aided by those powers,<br>began to stupefy the Kauravas, O Bharata! The valiant Rakshasa, assuming<br>many fierce and grim heads, began to devour the celestial weapons of the<br>Suta's son. Soon again, the gigantic Rakshasa, with a hundred wounds on<br>his body seemed to lie cheerlessly, as if dead, on the field. The Kaurava<br>bulls then, regarding Ghatotkacha deed, uttered loud shouts (of joy).<br>Soon, however, he was seen on all sides, careering in new forms. Once<br>more, he was seen to assume a prodigious form, with a hundred heads and a<br>hundred stomachs, and looking like the Mainaka mountain.[235] Once again,<br>becoming small about the measure of the thumb, he moved about<br>transversely or soared aloft like the swelling surges of the sea. Tearing<br>through the earth and rising on the surface, he dived again into the<br>waters. Once seen here, he was next seen at a different place. Descending<br>then from the welkin, he was seen standing, clad in mail, on a car decked<br>with gold, having wandered through earth and sky and all the points of<br>the compass, aided by his powers of illusion. Approaching then the<br>vicinity of Karna's car, Ghatotkacha, with his ear-rings waving,<br>fearlessly addressed the Suta's son, O monarch, and said, 'Wait a little,<br>O Suta's son. Whither shalt thou go with life, avoiding me. I shall<br>today, on the field of battle, quell thy desire of fight.' Having said<br>those words, that Rakshasas, of cruel prowess and eyes red like copper in<br>wrath, soared aloft into the sky and laughed aloud. Like a lion smiting a<br>prince of elephants, he began to strike Karna, pouring upon him a shower<br>of shafts, each of the measure the Aksha, of a car. Indeed, he poured<br>that arrowy shower upon Karna, that bull among car-warriors, like a cloud<br>pouring torrents of rain on a mountain, Karna destroyed that shower of<br>arrows from a distance. Beholding his illusion destroyed by Karna, O bull<br>of Bharata's race, Ghatotkacha once more created an illusion and made<br>himself invisible. He became a high mountain with many summits and<br>abounding with tall trees. And from that mountain incessantly issued<br>streams of lances and spears and swords and clubs. Seeing that mountain,<br>which resembled a mighty mass of antimony, with its streams of fierce<br>weapons, on the welkin, Karna was not at all agitated. Smiling the while,<br>Karna invoked into existence a celestial weapon. Cut off with that<br>weapon, that huge mountain was destroyed. Then he fierce Ghatotkacha,<br>becoming a blue cloud with a rainbow, in the welkin, began to pour upon<br>the Suta's son a shower of stones. Vikartana's son, Karna, who was called<br>also Vrisha, that foremost of all persons acquainted with weapons, aiming<br>a Vayavya weapon, destroyed that dart-cloud. Then covering all the points<br>of the compass with innumerable shafts, he destroyed a weapon that had<br>been aimed at him by Ghatotkacha. The mighty son of Bhimasena then<br>laughing loudly in that battle, once more invoked into existence an<br>all-powerful illusion against the mighty car-warrior Karna. Once more<br>beholding that foremost of warriors, viz., Ghatotkacha, fearlessly<br>approaching him, surrounded by a large number of Rakshasas that resembled<br>lions and tigers and infuriated elephants in prowess, some riding on<br>elephants, some on cars, and some on horseback, all armed with diverse<br>weapons and clad in diverse kinds of mail and diverse kinds of ornaments;<br>in fact, beholding Ghatotkacha surrounded by those fierce Rakshasas like<br>Vasava by the Maruts, the mighty bowman Karna began to battle with him<br>fiercely. Then Ghatotkacha piercing Karna with five shafts, uttered a<br>terrible roar frightening all the kings. Once more shooting an Anjalika<br>weapon, Ghatotkacha quickly cut off the bow of Karna's hand along with<br>the arrowy shower the latter had shot. Karna then taking out another bow<br>that was strong and capable of bearing a great strain and that was as<br>large as Indra's bow, drew it with great force. Then Karna shot some<br>foe-slaying shafts of golden wings at those sky-ranging Rakshasas.<br>Afflicted with those shafts, the large foes of broad chested Rakshasas<br>looked agitated like a herd of wild elephants afflicted by a lion.<br>Destroying with his shafts those Rakshasas along with their steeds and<br>diverse elephants, the puissant Karna looked like the divine Agni<br>consuming all creatures at the time of the universal dissolution. Having<br>destroyed that Rakshasa host, the Suta's son looked resplendent like the<br>god Maheswara in heaven after having consumed the triple city (of the<br>Asuras). Among those thousands of kings on the Pandava side, O sire,<br>there was not a single one, O monarch, that could even look at Karna<br>then, save the mighty Ghatotkacha, that prince of Rakshasas, who was<br>endued with terrible energy and strength, and who, inflamed with rage,<br>then looked like Yama himself. From his eyes, as he was excited with<br>wrath, flames of fire seemed to emit, like blazing drops of oil from a<br>couple of burning brands. Striking his palm against palm and biting his<br>nether lip, the Rakshasa was once more seen on a car that had been<br>created by his illusion, and unto which were yoked a number of asses,<br>looking like elephants and having the faces of Pisachas. Excited with<br>wrath, he addressed his driver, saying, 'Bear me towards the Suta's son.'<br>Then that foremost of car-warriors proceeded on that terrible-looking car<br>of his, for once more fighting a single combat with the Suta's son, O<br>king! The Rakshasa, excited with rage, hurled at the Suta's son an Asani<br>of Rudra's workmanship, terrible and furnished with eight wheels. Karna,<br>placing his bow on his car, jumped down on the earth and seizing that<br>Asani hurled it back at Ghatotkacha. The latter, however, had quickly<br>descended from his car (before the weapon could reach it). The Asani,<br>meanwhile, of great effulgence, having reduced the Raksha's car to ashes,<br>with it steeds, driver, and standard, piercing through the earth,<br>disappeared within its bowels, at which the gods were filled with wonder.<br>Then all creatures applauded Karna, who, having jumped down from his car,<br>had seized that Asani. Having achieved that feat, Karna once more<br>ascended his car. The Suta's sort, that scorcher of foes, then began to<br>shoot his shafts. Indeed, O giver of honours, there is none else amongst<br>all living creatures who can accomplish what Karna accomplished in that<br>frightful battle. Struck by Karna with shafts like a mountain with<br>torrents of rain, Ghatotkacha once more disappeared from the field of<br>battle like the melting forms of vapour in the sky. Contending in this<br>way, the gigantic Rakshasa, that slayer of foes, destroyed the celestial<br>weapons of Karna by means of his activity as also his power of illusion.<br>Seeing his weapons destroyed by the Rakshasa, aided by his powers of<br>illusion, Karna, without being inspired with fear, continued to fight<br>with the cannibal. Then, O monarch, the mighty son of Bhimasena excited<br>with wrath, divided his own self into many parts, frightening all the<br>mighty car-warriors (of the Kuru army). Then there came on the field of<br>battle lions, and tigers, and hyenas, and snakes with fiery tongues, and<br>birds with iron beaks. As regards Ghatotkacha. himself, struck with the<br>keen arrows that were sped from Karna's bow, that huge Rakshasa, looking<br>like (Himavat) the prince of mountains, disappeared then and there. Then<br>many Rakshasas and Pisachas and Yatudhanas, and large numbers of wolves<br>and leopards, of frightful faces rushed towards Karna for devouring him.<br>These approached the Suta's son, uttering fierce howls for frightening<br>him. Karna pierced every one of those monsters with many swift-winged and<br>terrible shafts that drank their blood. At last, using a celestial<br>weapon, he destroyed that illusion of the Rakshasa. He then, with some<br>straight and fierce shafts, struck the steeds of Ghatotkacha. These, with<br>broken and maimed limbs, and their backs cut by those shafts, fell down<br>on the earth, in the very sight of Ghatotkacha. The son of Hidimva,<br>seeing his illusion dispelled, once more made himself invisible, saying<br>unto Karna, the son of Vikartana, 'I will presently compass thy<br>destruction.'"
