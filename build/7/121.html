                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding Duhsasana's car staying near his, the son of<br>Bharadwaja, addressing Duhsasana, said these words, 'Why, O Duhsasana,<br>are all these cars flying away? Is the king well? Is the ruler of the<br>Sindhus yet alive? Thou art a prince. Thou art a brother of the king.<br>Thou art a mighty car-warrior. Why dost thou fly away from battle?<br>(Securing the throne to thy brother), become thou that Prince-Regent.<br>Thou hadst formerly said unto Draupadi, 'Thou art our slave, having been<br>won by us at dice. Without being confined to thy husbands, cast aside thy<br>chastity. Be thou a bearer of robes to the king, my eldest brother. Thy<br>husbands are all dead. They are as worthless as grains of sesamum without<br>kernel.' Having said these words then, why, O Duhsasana, dost thou fly<br>from battle now? Having thyself provoked such fierce hostilities with the<br>Panchalas and the Pandavas, why art thou afraid in battle in the presence<br>of Satyaki alone? Taking up the dice on the occasion of the gambling<br>match, couldst thou not divine that those dice then handled by thee would<br>soon transform themselves into fierce shafts resembling snakes of<br>virulent poison? It was thou that hadst formerly applied diverse abusive<br>epithets towards the Pandavas. The woes of Draupadi have thee for their<br>root. Where now is that pride, that insolence, that brag of thine? Why<br>dost thou fly, having angered the Pandavas, those terrible snakes of<br>virulent poison? When thou that art a brave brother of Suyodhana, are<br>intent on flight, without doubt, O hero, thou shouldst today protect,<br>relying on the energy of thy own arms, this routed and panic-stricken<br>Kaurava host. Without doing this, thou, however, forsakest the battle in<br>fear and enhancest the joy of thy foes. O slayer of foes, when thou that<br>art the leader of thy host, fliest away thus, who else will stay in<br>battle? When thou, its refuge, art frightened, who is there that will not<br>be frightened? Fighting with a single warrior of the Satwata race, thy<br>heart is inclined towards flight from battle. What, however, O Kaurava,<br>wilt thou do when thou wilt see the wielder of Gandiva in battle, or<br>Bhimasena, or the twins (Nakula and Sahadeva)? The shafts of Satyaki,<br>frightened by which thou seekest safety in flight, are scarcely equal to<br>those of Phalguna in battle that resemble the sun or fire in splendour.<br>If thy heart is firmly bent on flight, let the sovereignty of the earth<br>then, upon the conclusion of peace, be given to king Yudhishthira the<br>Just. Before the shafts of Phalguna, resembling snakes freed from their<br>sloughs, enter thy body, make peace with the Pandavas. Before the<br>high-souled Parthas, slaying thy hundred brothers in battle, wrest the<br>earth by force, make peace with the Pandavas. Before king Yudhishthira is<br>enraged, and Krishna also, that delighter in battle, makes peace with the<br>Pandavas. Before the mighty-armed Bhima, penetrating into this vast host,<br>seizes thy brothers, make peace with the Pandavas. Bhishma formerly told<br>thy brother Suyodhana, 'The Pandavas are unconquerable in battle. O<br>amiable one, make peace with them.' Thy wicked brother Suyodhana however,<br>did not do it. Therefore, setting thy heart firmly on battle, fight<br>vigorously with the Pandavas. Go quickly on thy car to the spot where<br>Satyaki is. Without thee, O Bharata, this host will fly away. For the<br>sake of thy own self, fight in battle with Satyaki, of prowess incapable<br>of being baffled.' Thus addressed (by Drona), thy son said not a word in<br>reply. Feigning not to have heard the words (of Bharadwaja's son),<br>Duhsasana proceeded to the place where Satyaki was. Accompanied by a<br>large force of unretreating Mlecchas, and coming upon Satyaki in battle,<br>Duhsasana fought vigorously with that hero. Drona also, that foremost of<br>car-warriors, excited with wrath, rushed against the Panchalas and the<br>Pandavas, with moderate speed. Penetrating into the midst of the Pandava<br>host in that battle, Drona began to crush their warriors by hundreds and<br>thousands. And Drona, O king, proclaiming his name in that battle, caused<br>a great carnage among the Pandavas, the Panchalas, and the Matsyas. The<br>illustrious Viraketu, the son of the ruler of the Panchalas, rushed<br>against the son of Bharadwaja who thus engaged in vanquishing the Pandava<br>ranks. Piercing Drona with five straight shafts, that prince then pierced<br>Drona's standard with one shaft, and then his charioteer with seven. The<br>sight that I then beheld, O monarch, in that battle, was exceedingly<br>wonderful, inasmuch as Drona, though exerting himself vigorously could<br>not approach the prince of the Panchalas. Then, O sire, the Panchalas,<br>beholding Drona checked in battle, surrounded the latter on all sides, O<br>king, from desire of king Yudhishthira's victory. And those warriors then<br>covered Drona along with showers of fiery shafts and strong lances and<br>various other kinds of weapons, O king! Baffling then those dense showers<br>of weapons by means of his own numerous shafts like the wind driving away<br>from the welkin masses of clouds, Drona looked exceedingly resplendent.<br>Then that slayer of hostile heroes (the son of Bharadwaja), aimed a<br>fierce shaft endued with the effulgence of the sun or the fire, at the<br>car of Viraketu. The shaft, O monarch, piercing through the prince of<br>Panchala, quickly entered the earth, bathed in blood and blazing like a<br>flame of fire. Then the prince of the Panchalas quickly fell down from<br>his car, like a Champaka tree uprooted by the wind, falling down from a<br>mountain summit. Upon the fall of that great bowman, that prince endued<br>with great might, the Panchalas speedily encompassed Drona on every side.<br>Then Chitraketu, and Sudhanwan, and Chitravarman, O Bharata, and<br>Chitraratha also, all afflicted with grief on account of their (slain)<br>brother, together rushed against the son of Bharadwaja, desirous of<br>battling with him, and shooting shafts (at him) like the clouds (pouring)<br>at the end of summer. Struck from all sides by those mighty car-warriors<br>of royal lineage, that bull among Brahmanas mustered all his energy and<br>wrath for their destruction. Then Drona, shot showers of shafts at them.<br>Struck with those shafts of Drona shot from his bow to its fullest<br>stretch those princess. O best of monarchs, became confounded and know<br>not what to do. The angry Drona, O Bharata, beholding those princes<br>stupefied, smilingly deprived them of their steeds and charioteers and<br>cars in that battle. Then the illustrious son of Bharadwaja, by means of<br>his sharp arrows and broad-headed shafts, cut off their heads, like a<br>person plucking flowers from a tree. Deprived of life, those princes<br>there, O king of great splendour, fell down from their cars on the earth,<br>like the (slain) Daityas and Danavas in the battle between the gods and<br>the Asuras in days of old. Having slain them in battle, O king, the<br>valiant son of Bharadwaja shook his invincible bow, the back of whose<br>staff was decked with gold. Beholding those mighty car-warriors,<br>resembling the very celestials among the Panchalas slain, Dhrishtadyumna<br>inflamed with rage, shed tears in that battle. Excited with wrath, he<br>rushed, in that encounter, against Drona's car. Then, O king, cries of<br>woe suddenly arose there at the sight of Drona covered with arrows by the<br>prince of Panchala. Completely shrouded by the high-souled son of<br>Prishata, Drona, however, suffered no pain. On the other hand, he<br>continued to fight, smiling the while. The prince of the Panchalas then,<br>furious with rage, struck Drona in the chest with many straight shafts.<br>Deeply pierced by that mighty warrior, the illustrious son Of Bharadwaja<br>sat down on the terrace of his car and fell into a swoon. Beholding him<br>in that condition, Dhrishtadyumna endued with great Prowess and energy,<br>laid aside his bow and quickly took up a sword. That mighty car-warrior<br>then, speedily jumping down from his own car, Mounted that of Bharadwaja,<br>O 'sire, in no time, his eyes red in wrath and impelled by the desire of<br>cutting Drona's head from off his trunk. Meanwhile, the valiant Drona,<br>regaining his senses, took up his bow and seeing Dhrishtadyumna arrived<br>so near him from desire of slaughter, began to pierce that mighty<br>car-warrior with shafts measuring a span only in length and therefore,<br>fit to be used in close fight. Those arrows of the measure of a span and<br>fit to be used in close fight, were known to Drona, O king! And with them<br>he succeeded in weakening Dhrishtadyumna. The mighty Dhrishtadyumna,<br>struck with a large number of those arrows, quickly jumped down from<br>Drona's car. Then, that hero of great prowess, his impetuosity baffled,<br>mounted upon his own car and once more took up his large bow. And the<br>mighty car-warrior Dhrishtadyumna once more began to pierce Drona in that<br>battle. And Drona also, O monarch, began to pierce the son of Prishata<br>with his arrows. There. upon, the battle that took place between Drona<br>and the prince of the Panchalas was wonderful in the extreme, like that<br>between Indra and Prahlada, both desirous of the sovereignty of the three<br>worlds. Both conversant with the ways of battle, they careered over the<br>field, displaying diverse motions of their cars and mangling each other<br>with their shafts, And Drona and Prishata's son, stupefying the mind of<br>the warriors, shot showers of shafts like two mighty clouds (pouring<br>torrents of rain) in the rainy season. And those illustrious warriors<br>shrouded with their shafts the welkin, the points of the compass, and the<br>earth. And all creatures, viz., the Kshatriyas, O king, and all the other<br>combatants there, highly applauded that battle between them. And the<br>Panchalas, O king, loudly exclaimed, 'Without doubt, Drona, having<br>encountered Dhrishtadyumna in battle, will succumb to us. Then Drona, in<br>that battle, quickly cut off the head of Dhristadyumna's charioteer like<br>a person plucking a ripe fruit from a tree. Then the steeds, O king, of<br>the high-souled Dhrishtadyumna ran away and after those steeds had<br>carried away Dhrishtadyumna from the field, Drona, endued with great<br>prowess, began to rout the Panchalas and the Srinjayas in that battle.<br>Having vanquished the Pandus and the Panchalas, Bharadwaja's son of great<br>prowess, that chastiser of foes, once more took up his station in the<br>midst of his own array. And the Pandavas, O lord, ventured not to<br>vanquish him in battle.'
