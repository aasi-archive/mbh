                            "Sanjaya said, 'After the ruler of the Sindhus had been slain by Partha,<br>Krishna, repairing unto the king, viz., Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma,<br>worshipped the latter with a gladdened heart. And he said, 'By good luck,<br>O king of kings, thy prosperity increaseth. O best of men, thy foe hath<br>been slain. By good luck, thy younger brother hath accomplished his vow.'<br>Thus addressed by Krishna, that subjugator of hostile towns, viz., king<br>Yudhishthira, filled with joy, came down from his car, O Bharata! His<br>eyes filled with tears of joy, he embraced the two Krishnas and wiping<br>his bright and lotus-like face, said these words unto Vasudeva, and<br>Dhananjaya, the son of Pandu, 'Ye mighty car-warriors, by good luck, I<br>behold both of you after ye have accomplished your task. By good luck,<br>that sinful wretch, viz., the ruler of the Sindhus, hath been slain. Ye<br>Krishnas, by good luck, ye have done that which hath filled me with great<br>happiness. By good luck, our foes have been plunged into an ocean of<br>grief. Thou art the sovereign lord of all the worlds, O slayer of Madhu!<br>In the three worlds they that have thee for their preceptor can have no<br>object incapable of accomplishment. Through thy grace, O Govinda, we will<br>conquer our foes, like Indra conquering the Danavas in days of old. Be it<br>the conquest of the world, or be it the conquest of the three worlds,<br>everything is certain, O thou of the Vrishni race, in their case with<br>whom thou art gratified, O giver of honours! They can have no sin, nor<br>can they meet with defeat in battle with whom thou, O lord of the<br>celestials, art gratified, O giver of honours! It is through thy grace, O<br>Hrishikesa, that Sakra hath become the chief of the celestials. It is<br>through thy grace, that blessed personage obtained on the field of battle<br>the sovereignty of the three worlds! It is through thy grace, O lord of<br>the celestials, that the latter obtained immortality, O Krishna, and<br>enjoy eternal regions (of bliss). Having slain thousands of Daityas, with<br>prowess having its origin in thy grace, O slayer of foes, Sakra obtained<br>the lordship of the celestials. Through thy grace, O Hrishikesa, the<br>mobile and immobile universe, without swerving from its (ordained)<br>course, O hero, is engaged in prayers and homa![178] In the beginning,<br>this universe, enveloped in darkness, had been one vast expanse of water.<br>Through thy grace, O mighty-armed one, the universe became manifest, O<br>best of men! Thou art the creator of all the worlds, thou art the Supreme<br>Soul, and thou art immutable! They that behold thee, O Hrishikesa, are<br>never confounded. Thou art the Supreme God, thou art the God of gods, and<br>thou art Eternal. They that seek refuge with thee, O lord of the gods,<br>are never confounded. Without beginning and without death, thou art<br>Divine, the Creator of all the worlds, and immutable. They that are<br>devoted to thee, O Hrishikesa, always tide over every difficulty. Thou<br>art Supreme, the Ancient one, the Divine-Being, and that which is the<br>Highest of the high. He that attaineth to that viz., thy Supreme Self<br>hath ordained for him the highest prosperity. Thou art sung in the four<br>Vedas. The four Vedas sing of thee. Be seeking thy shelter, O high-souled<br>one, I shall enjoy unrivalled prosperity. Thou art the Supreme God, thou<br>art the God of the highest gods, thou art the lord of Winged creatures,<br>and the lord of all human beings. Thou art the Supremest Lord of<br>everything. I bow to thee, O best of beings! Thou art the Lord, the Lord<br>of lords O puissant one! Prosperity to thee, O Madhava! O thou of large<br>eyes, O Universal soul, Thou art the origin of all things. He, again,<br>that is a friend of Dhananjaya or is engaged in Dhananjaya's good,<br>obtaineth thee that art the preceptor of Dhananjaya and attaineth to<br>happiness.' Thus addressed by him those high-souled ones, viz., Kesava<br>and Arjuna, cheerfully said unto the king, that lord of the earth, 'The<br>sinful king Jayadratha, hath been consumed by the fire of thy wrath. O<br>puissant one, although the Dhartarashtra host is vast and swelleth with<br>pride, yet, O Bharata, struck and slain, it is being exterminated. O<br>slayer of foes, it is in consequence of thy wrath that the Kauravas are<br>being destroyed. Having, O hero, angered thee that canst slay with thy<br>eyes alone, the wicked-minded Suyodhana, with his friends and kinsmen,<br>will have to lay down his life in battle. Slain before in consequence of<br>thy ire, and struck down also by the gods themselves, the invincible<br>Bhishma, the grandsire of the Kurus, lieth now on a bed of arrows. O<br>slayer of foes, victory in battle is unattainable by them, and death also<br>waiteth for them, that have thee, O son of Pandu, for their foe. Kingdom,<br>life, dear ones, children, and diverse kinds of bliss, will soon be lost<br>by him with whom thou, O scorcher of foes, hast been angry. I regard the<br>Kauravas to be lost with their sons, and kinsmen, when thou, O scorcher<br>of foes, that art observant of the duties of a king, hast been angry with<br>them.' Then Bhima, O king, and the mighty car-warrior Satyaki, both<br>mangled with shafts, saluted their senior. And those two mighty bowmen<br>sat down on the ground, surrounded by the Panchalas, Beholding those two<br>heroes filled with joy and arrived and waiting with joined hands, the son<br>of Kunti congratulated them both, saying, 'By good luck, it is that I see<br>you both, ye heroes, escaped with lire from that sea of (hostile) troops,<br>that sea in which Drona acted the part of an invincible alligator, and<br>the son of Hridika that of a fierce shark. By good luck, all the kings of<br>the earth have been vanquished (by you two).[179] By good luck, I see<br>both of you victorious in battle. By good luck, Drona hath been<br>vanquished in battle, and that mighty car-warrior also viz., the son of<br>Hridika. By good luck, Karna hath been vanquished in battle with barbed<br>shafts. By good luck, Salya also was obliged to turn away from the field<br>by you both, ye bulls among men. By good luck, I behold you both come<br>back from battle safe and sound, ye that are foremost of car-warriors and<br>well-skilled in battle! By good luck, I behold again, ye heroes, that<br>have forded that sea of troops in obedience to my command, ye that went<br>to battle impelled by the desire of honouring me! Ye are heroes<br>delighting in battle. Ye are to me as life. By good luck, I see you<br>both.' Having said this, the son of Pandu, O king, embraced both<br>Yuyudhana and Vrikodara, those tigers among men, and shed tears of joy.<br>Then, O monarch, the entire host of the Pandavas became cheerful and<br>filled with joy. And all of them once more set their hearts on battle.'"
