                            "Sanjaya said, 'Upon the fall of Sudakshina and of the heroic Srutayudha,<br>O monarch, thy warriors, filled with wrath, rushed with speed at Partha.<br>The Abhishahas, the Surasenas, the Sivis, the Vasatis began, O king, to<br>scatter their arrowy showers on Dhananjaya. The son of Pandu then<br>consumed by means of his arrows six hundred of them at once. Thereupon,<br>those warriors, terrified, fled away like smaller animals from a tiger.<br>Rallying, they once more surrounded Partha, who was slaying his foes and<br>vanquishing them in battle. Dhananjaya then, with shafts sped from<br>Gandiva, speedily felled the heads and arms of the combatants thus<br>rushing upon him. Not an inch of the field of battle was unstrewn with<br>fallen heads, and the flights of crows and vultures and ravens that<br>hovered over the field seemed to form a cloudy canopy. Seeing their men<br>thus exterminated, Srutayus and Achyutayus were both filled with wrath.<br>And they continued to contend vigorously with Dhananjaya. Endued with<br>great might, proud, heroic, of noble lineage, and possessed of strength<br>of arms, those two bowmen, O king, solicitous of winning great fame and<br>desirous, for the sake of thy son, to compass the destruction of Arjuna,<br>quickly showered upon the latter their arrowy downpours at once from his<br>right and left. Those angry heroes, with a thousand straight shafts,<br>covered Arjuna like two masses of clouds filling a lake. Then that<br>foremost of car-warriors viz., Srutayus filled with wrath, struck<br>Dhananjaya with a well-tempered lance. That crusher of foes viz., Arjuna,<br>then, deeply pierced by his mighty foe, swooned away in that battle,<br>stupefying Kesava also (by that act). Meanwhile, the mighty car-warrior<br>Achyutayus forcibly struck the son of Pandu with a keen-pointed spear. By<br>the act he seemed to pour an acid upon the wound of the high-souled son<br>of Pandu. Deeply pierced therewith, Partha supported himself by seizing<br>the flag-staff. Then a leonine shout was sent forth by all the troops, O<br>monarch, in the belief that Dhananjaya was deprived of life. And Krishna<br>also was scorched with grief upon beholding Partha senseless. Then Kesava<br>comforted Dhananjaya with soothing words.. Then those foremost of<br>car-warriors, (viz., Srutayus and Achyutayus), of true aim, pouring their<br>arrowy showers on all sides, in that battle, made Dhananjaya and Vasudeva<br>of Vrishni's race invisible with their car and car-wheels and Kuvaras,<br>their steeds and flagstaff and banner. And all this seemed wonderful.<br>Meanwhile, O Bharata, Vibhatsu slowly regained his senses, like one come<br>back from the very abode of the king of the dead. Beholding his car with<br>Kesava overwhelmed with arrows and seeing also those two antagonists of<br>his staying before him like two blazing fires, the mighty car-warriors<br>Partha then invoked into existence the weapon named after Sakra. From<br>that weapon flowed thousands of straight shafts. And those shafts struck<br>Srutayus and Achyutayus, those mighty bowmen. And the arrows shot by the<br>latter, pierced by those of Partha, coursed through the welkin. And the<br>son of Pandu quickly baffling those arrows by the force of his own<br>arrows, began to career over the field, encountering mighty car-warriors.<br>Meanwhile Srutayus and Achyutayus were, by Arjuna's arrowy showers,<br>deprived of their arms and heads. And they fell down on the earth, like a<br>couple of tall trees broken by the wind. And the death of Srutayus and<br>slaughter of Achyutayus created surprise equal to what men would feel at<br>the sight of the ocean becoming dry. Then slaying fifty car-warriors<br>amongst the followers of those two princes, Partha proceeded against the<br>Bharata army, slaying many foremost of warriors. Beholding both Srutayus<br>and Achyutayus slain, their sons, those foremost of men, viz., Niyatayus<br>and Dirghayus, O Bharata, both filled with rage, rushed against the son<br>of Kunti, scattering shafts of diverse kinds, and much pained by the<br>calamity that had happened to their sires. Arjuna, excited with rage, in<br>a moment despatched them both towards Yama's abode, by means of straight<br>shafts. And those bulls among Kshatriyas (that were in the Kuru army)<br>were unable to resist Partha who agitated the Dhartarashtra ranks, like<br>an elephant agitating the waters of a lake filled with lotuses. Then<br>thousands of trained elephant-riders amongst the Angas, O monarch, filled<br>with rage, surrounded the son of Pandu with their elephant-force. Urged<br>by Duryodhana, many kings also of the west and the south, and many others<br>headed by the ruler of the Kalingas, also surrounded Arjuna, with their<br>elephants huge as hills. Partha however, with shafts sped from Gandiva,<br>quickly cut off the heads and arms, decked with ornaments, of those<br>advancing combatants. The field of battle, strewn with those heads and<br>arms decked with Angadas, looked like golden stones entwined by snakes.<br>And the arms of warriors cut off therewith, while failing down, looked<br>like birds dropping down from trees. And the elephants, pierced with<br>thousands of arrows and shedding blood (from their wounds), looked like<br>hills in the season of rains with liquefied red chalk streaming down<br>their sides. Others, slain by Partha with sharp shafts, lay prostrate on<br>the field. And many Mlecchas on the backs of elephants, of diverse kinds<br>of ugly forms, robed in diverse attires, O king, and armed with diverse<br>kinds of weapons, and bathed in blood, looked resplendent as they lay on<br>the field, deprived of life by means of diverse kinds of arrows. And<br>thousands of elephants along with their riders and those on foot that<br>urged them forward, struck with Partha's shafts, vomited blood, or<br>uttered shrieks of agony, or fell down, or ran ungovernably in all<br>directions. And many, exceedingly frightened, trod down and crushed their<br>own men. And many which were kept as reserves and which were fierce as<br>snakes of virulent poison, did the same. And many terrible Yavanas and<br>Paradas and Sakas and Valhikas, and Mlecchas born of the cow (belonging<br>to Vasishtha), of fierce eyes, accomplished in smiting looking like<br>messengers of Death, and all conversant with the deceptive powers of the<br>Asuras and many Darvabhisaras and Daradas and Pundras numbering by<br>thousands, of bands, and together forming a force that was countless,<br>began to shower their sharp shafts upon the son of Pandu. Accomplished in<br>various modes of warfare, those Mlecchas covered Arjuna with their<br>arrows. Upon them, Dhananjaya also quickly poured his arrows. And those<br>arrows, shot from Gandiva, looked like flights of locusts, as they<br>coursed through the welkin. Indeed. Dhananjaya, having by his arrows<br>caused a shade over the troops like that of the clouds, slew, by the<br>force of his weapons, all the Mlecchas, with heads completely shaved or<br>half-shaved or covered with matted locks, impure in habits, and of<br>crooked faces. Those dwellers of hills, pierced with arrows, those<br>denizens of mountain-caves, fled away in fear. And ravens and Kankas and<br>wolves, with great glee, drank the blood of those elephants and steeds<br>and their Mleccha-riders overthrown on the field by Partha with his sharp<br>shafts. Indeed, Arjuna caused a fierce river to flow there whose current<br>consisted of blood. (Slain) foot-soldiers and steeds and cars and<br>elephants constituted its embankments. The showers of shafts poured<br>constituted its rafts and the hairs of the combatants formed its moss and<br>weeds. And the fingers cut off from the arms of warriors, formed its<br>little fishes. And that river was as awful as Death itself at the end of<br>the Yuga. And that river of blood flowed towards the region of Yama, and<br>the bodies of stain elephants floating on it, obstructed its current. And<br>the earth was covered all over with the blood of Kshatriyas and of<br>elephants and steeds and their riders, and became one bloody expanse like<br>to what is seen when Indra showers a heavy down-pour covering uplands and<br>lowlands alike. And that bull among Kshatriyas despatched six thousand<br>horsemen and again a thousand foremost of Kshatriyas in that battle into<br>the jaws of death. Thousands of well-equipped elephants, pierced with<br>arrows, lay prostrate on the field, like hills struck down by thunder.<br>And Arjuna careered over the field, slaying steeds and car-warriors and<br>elephants, like an elephant of rent temples crushing a forest a reeds. As<br>a conflagration, urged by the wind, consumes a dense forest of trees and<br>creepers and plants and dry wood and grass, even so did that fire, viz.,<br>Pandu's son Dhananjaya, having shafts for its flames and urged on by the<br>Krishna-wind, angrily consume the forest of thy warriors. Making the<br>terraces of cars empty, and causing the earth to be strewn, with human<br>bodies, Dhananjaya seemed to dance bow in hand, in the midst of those<br>vast masses of men. Deluging the earth with blood by means of his shafts,<br>endued with the strength of the thunder, Dhananjaya, excited with wrath,<br>penetrated into the Bharata host. While thus proceeding, Srutayus, the<br>ruler of the Amvashthas, resisted him. Arjuna then, O sire, speedily<br>felled with keen shafts equipped with Kanka feathers, the steeds of<br>Srutayus struggling in battle. And cutting off with other shafts, the bow<br>also of his antagonist, Partha careered over the field. The ruler of the<br>Amvashthas, then with eyes troubled in wrath, took up a mace and<br>approached the mighty car-warrior Partha and Kesava also in that battle.<br>Then that hero, uplifting his mace, stopped the (progress of Arjuna's)<br>car by its strokes, and struck Kesava also therewith. Then that slayer of<br>hostile heroes, viz., Arjuna, beholding Kesava struck with that mace,<br>became filled with wrath. And, then, O Bharata, that hero, with his<br>shafts, equipped with wings of gold, covered the ruler of the Amvashthas,<br>that foremost or car-warriors, armed with mace, like clouds covering the<br>risen sun. With other shafts, Partha then cut off the mace of that<br>high-souled warrior in fragments, reducing it almost to dust. And all<br>this seemed highly wonderful. Beholding that mace of his cut off in<br>fragments, the ruler of the Amvashthas took up another huge mace, and<br>repeatedly struck both Arjuna and Kesava therewith. Then, Arjuna with a<br>couple of sharp broad-faced arrows, cut off the uplifted arms of Srutayus<br>which held the mace, those arms that looked like a couple of Indra's<br>standard, and with another winged arrow, he cut off the head of that<br>warrior. Thus slain, Srutayus fell down, O king, filling the earth with a<br>loud noise, like a tall standard of Indra when the strings, tying it to<br>the engine on which it is set, are cut off. Surrounded then on all sides<br>by rounds of cars and by hundreds upon hundreds of elephants and cars,<br>Partha became invisible like the sun covered with clouds.'"
