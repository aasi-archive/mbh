                            "Sanjaya said, Upon the fall, O king, of the ruler of the Sindhus, thy<br>son Suyodhana, his face bedewed with tears, and himself filled with grief<br>and breathing hot sighs like a snake whose fangs have been broken, that<br>offender against the whole world, viz., thy son, experienced bitter<br>affliction. Beholding that great terrible slaughter of his troops caused<br>by Jishnu and Bhimasena and Satwata in battle, he became pale, dejected<br>and melancholy, and his eyes became filled with tears. And he came to<br>think no warrior existed on the earth that could be compared with Arjuna.<br>Neither Drona, nor the son of Radha, nor Aswatthaman, nor Kripa, O sire,<br>is competent to stand before Arjuna when the latter is excited with<br>wrath, And Suyodhana, said unto himself, 'Having vanquished in battle all<br>the mighty car-warriors of my army, Partha slew the ruler of the Sindhus.<br>None could resist him. This my vast host hath almost been exterminated by<br>the Pandavas. I think, there is no one that can protect my army, no, not<br>even Purandara himself. He, relying upon whom I have been engaged in this<br>passage-at-arms in battle, alas, that Karna hath been defeated in battle<br>and Jayadratha slain. That Karna relying upon whose energy I regarded<br>Krishna as straw who came to sue me for peace, alas, that Karna hath been<br>vanquished in battle.' Grieving so within his heart, that offender<br>against the whole world, O king, went to Drona, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>for seeing him. Repairing unto him, he informed Drona of that immense<br>slaughter of the Kurus, the victory of his foes, and the dire calamity of<br>the Dhartarashtras.[180] And Suyodhana said, 'Behold, O preceptor, this<br>immense slaughter of kings.[181] I came to battle, placing that grandsire<br>of mine, viz., the heroic Bhishma, at our head. Having slain him,<br>Sikhandin, his aspiration fulfilled, stayeth at the very van of all the<br>troops, surrounded by all the Panchalas, covetous of another<br>triumph.[182] Another disciple of thine, viz., the invincible<br>Savyasachin, having slain seven. Akshauhinis of troops hath despatched<br>king Jayadratha to Yama's abode. How, O preceptor, shall I be freed from<br>the debt I owe to those allies of mine who, desirous of victory to me and<br>ever engaged in my good, have gone to Yama's abode? Those lords of earth<br>who had desired the sovereignty of the earth, are now lying on the earth,<br>abandoning all their earthly prosperity. Truly, I am a coward. Having<br>caused such a slaughter of friends, I dare not think that I shall be<br>sanctified by performing even a hundred horse-sacrifices. I am covetous<br>and sinful and a transgressor against righteousness. Through my acts<br>alone, these lords of earth, in their desire for victory, have gone to<br>Yama's abode. Why, in presence of those kings, does not the earth yield<br>me a hole (through which to sink), since I am so sinful in behaviour and<br>such a fomenter of internecine dissensions![183] Alas, what will the<br>grandsire with blood-red eyes, that invincible hero who hath conquered<br>the other world, tell me in the midst of the kings when he meets me?[184]<br>Behold that mighty bowman, Jalasandha, slain by Satyaki. That great<br>car-warrior, that hero, came proudly to battle for my sake, prepared to<br>lay down his life. Beholding the ruler of the Kamvojas slain, as also<br>Alamvusha and many other allies of mine, what object can I have for<br>preserving my life? Those unretreating heroes who, fighting for my sake<br>and struggling to the utmost of their powers to vanquish my foes, have<br>laid down their lives. I shall today, O scorcher of foes, exerting the<br>utmost measure of my might, free myself from the debt that I owe them and<br>gratify them with oblations of water by repairing to the Yamuna. O<br>foremost of all bearers of arms, I tell thee truly and swear by the good<br>acts I have performed, by the prowess I possess and by my sons, that<br>slaying all the Panchalas with the Pandavas, I shall obtain peace of<br>mind, or slain by them in battle I shall repair to those regions whither<br>those allies of mine have gone. I shall certainly proceed thither whither<br>those bulls among men, slain, while engaged in battle for my sake, by<br>Arjuna have gone! Our allies, seeing that they are not well-protected by<br>us, no longer desire to stand by us. O thou of mighty arms, they now<br>regard the Pandavas to be preferable to ourselves. Thyself, of sure aim,<br>hast ordained our extermination in battle, for thou treatest Arjuna<br>leniently, since he is thy disciple. It is for this that all those have<br>been slain who had endeavoured to secure victory to us. It seems that<br>only Karna now wishes us victory. The man of weak understanding who<br>without duly examining another, accepteth him for a friend and engageth<br>him in concerns that require friends for their accomplishment, is certain<br>to suffer injury even so hath this affair of mine been managed by my best<br>friend![185] I am exceedingly covetous, sinful, crooked-hearted, and<br>characterised by avarice! Alas, king Jayadratha hath been slain, and<br>Somadatta's son also of great energy, and the Abhishahas, the Surasenas,<br>the Sivis, and the Vasatis! I shall go thither today whither those bulls<br>among men, slain, while engaged in battle for my sake, by Arjuna, have<br>gone. In the absence of those bulls among men, I have no need for life. O<br>preceptor of the sons of Pandu, let me have thy permission in this.
