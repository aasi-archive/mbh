                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'What, indeed, O Sanjaya, did Duryodhana say when he<br>saw that Karna turning away from the field upon whom my sons had reposed<br>all their hopes of victory? How, indeed, did the mighty Bhima, proud of<br>his energy, fight? What also, O son, did Karna do after this, beholding<br>Bhimasena in that battle resemble a blazing fire?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Mounting upon another car that was duly equipped Karna<br>once more proceeded against the son of Pandu, with the fury of the Ocean<br>tossed by the tempest. Beholding Adhiratha's son excited with rage, thy<br>sons, O king, regarded Bhimasena to be already poured as a libation on<br>the (Karna) fire. With furious twang of bowstring and terrible sounds Of<br>his palms, the son of Radha shot dense showers of shafts towards<br>Bhimasena's car. And once more, O monarch, a terrible encounter took<br>Place between the heroic Karna and the high-souled Bhima. Both excited<br>with wrath, both endued with mighty arms, each desirous of slaying the<br>other, those two warriors looked at each other, as if resolved to burn<br>each O her with their (wrathful) glances. The eyes of both were red in<br>rage, and both breathed fiercely, like a couple of snakes. Endued with<br>great heroism, those two chastisers of foes approached and mangled each<br>other. Indeed, they fought with each other like two hawks endued with<br>great activity, or like two Sarabhas excited with wrath. Then that<br>chastiser of foes, viz., Bhima recollecting all the woes suffered by him<br>on the occasion of the match at dice, and during his exile in the woods<br>and residence in Virata's city, and bearing in mind the robbing of their<br>kingdom swelling with prosperity and gems, by thy sons, and the numerous<br>other wrongs inflicted on the Pandavas by thee and the Suta's son and<br>remembering also the fact that thou hadst conspired to burn innocent<br>Kunti with her sons, and calling to his memory the sufferings of Krishna<br>in the midst of the assembly at the hands of those wretches, as also the<br>seizure of her tresses by Duhsasana, and the harsh speeches uttered, O<br>Bharata, by Karna, to the effect, 'Take thou another husband, for all thy<br>husbands are dead: the sons of Pritha have sunk into hell and are like<br>sesamum seeds without kernel,'&#8212;remembering also those other words, O son<br>of Kuru, that the Kauravas uttered in thy presence, add the fact also<br>that thy sons had been desirous of enjoying Krishna as a slave, and those<br>harsh words that Karna spoke to the sons of Pandu when the latter,<br>attired in deer-skins were about to be banished to the woods, and the joy<br>in which thy wrathful and foolish son, himself in prosperity, indulged,<br>thinking the distressed sons of Pritha as veritable straw, the virtuous<br>Bhima that slayer of foes, remembering these and all the woes he had<br>suffered since his childhood, became reckless of his very life.<br>Stretching his invincible and formidable bow, the back of whose staff was<br>decked with gold, Vrikodara, that tiger of Bharata's race, utterly<br>reckless of his life, rushed against Karna. Shooting dense showers of<br>bright arrows whetted on stone, Bhima shrouded the very light of the sun.<br>Adhiratha's son, however, smiling the while, quickly baffled, by means of<br>his own winged arrows whetted on stone, that arrowy downpour of<br>Bhimasena. Endued with great strength and mighty arms, that mighty<br>car-warrior, the son of Adhiratha, then pierced Bhima with nine keen<br>arrows. Struck with those arrows, like an elephant struck with the hook.<br>Vrikodara fearlessly rushed against the Suta's son. Karna, however,<br>rushed against that bull among the Pandavas who was thus rushing towards<br>him with great impetuosity and might, like an infuriated elephant against<br>an infuriated compeer. Blowing his conch then, whose blast resembled the<br>sound of a hundred trumpets, Karna cheerfully agitated the force that<br>supported Bhima, like the raging sea. Beholding that force of his<br>consisting of elephants and steeds and cars and foot-soldiers, thus<br>agitated by Karna, Bhima, approaching the former, covered him with<br>arrows. Then Karna caused his own steeds of the hue of swans to be<br>mingled with those of Bhimasena's of the hue of bears, and shrouded the<br>son of Pandu with his shafts. Beholding those steeds of the hue of bears<br>and fleet as the wind, mingled with those of the hue of swans, cries of<br>oh and alas arose from among the troops of thy sons. Those steeds, fleet<br>as the wind, thus mingled together, looked exceedingly beautiful like<br>white and black clouds, O monarch, mingled together in the firmament.<br>Beholding Karna and Vrikodara to be both excited with wrath, great<br>car-warriors of thy army began to tremble with fear. The field of battle<br>where they fought soon became awful like the domain of Yama. Indeed, O<br>best of Bharatas, it became as frightful to behold as the city of the<br>dead. The great car, warriors of thy army, looking upon that scene, as if<br>they were spectators of a sport in an arena, beheld not any of the two to<br>gain any advantage over the other in that dreadful encounter. They only<br>beheld, O king, that mingling and clash of the mighty weapons of those<br>two warriors, as a result, O monarch, of the evil policy of thyself and<br>thy son. Those two slayers of foes-continued to cover each other with<br>their keen shafts. Both endued with wonderful prowess, they filled the<br>welkin with their arrowy downpours. Those two mighty car-warriors<br>shooting at each other keen shafts from desire of taking each other's<br>life, became exceedingly beautiful to behold like two clouds pouring<br>torrents of rain. Those two chastisers of foes, shooting gold-decked<br>arrows, made the welkin look bright, O king, as if with blazing meteors.<br>Shafts equipped with vulturine feathers, shot by those two heroes, looked<br>like rows of excited cranes in the autumn sky. Meanwhile, Krishna and<br>Dhananjaya, those chastisers of foes, engaged in battle with the Suta's<br>son, thought the burthen too great for Bhima to bear. As Karna and Bhima<br>for baffling each other's shafts, shot these arrows at each other, many<br>elephants and steeds and men deeply struck therewith, fell down deprived<br>of life. And in consequence of those falling and fallen creatures<br>deprived of life counting by thousands, a great carnage, O king, took<br>place in the army of thy sons. And soon, O bull of Bharata's race, the<br>field of battle became covered with the bodies of men and steeds and<br>elephants deprived of life.'"
