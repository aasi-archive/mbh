                            "Sanjaya continued, 'The warrior, O king, thus clad in mail on the field<br>of battle, adored the thousand-rayed Aditya as he rose at morn. When the<br>thousand-rayed luminary, of splendour bright, as burning gold, arose, and<br>the world became illumined, the battle once more commenced. The same<br>soldiers that were engaged with each other before the sunrise, once more<br>fought with each other, O Bharata, after, the rise of the sun. Horsemen<br>engaged with car-warriors, and elephants with horsemen, and foot-soldiers<br>with elephants and horsemen with horsemen, O bull of Bharata's race.<br>Sometimes, unitedly and sometimes separately, the warriors, fell upon one<br>another in battle. Having fought vigorously in the night, many, tired<br>with exertion, and weak with hunger and thirst became deprived of their<br>senses. The uproar made of the blare of conchs, the beat of drums, the<br>roar of elephants, and the twang of out-stretched bows drawn with force<br>touched the very heavens, O king! The noise made also by rushing infantry<br>and falling weapons, and neighing steeds and rolling cars, and shouting<br>and roaring of warriors, became tremendous. That loud noise increasing<br>every minute, reached the heavens. The groans and wails of pain, on<br>falling and fallen foot-soldiers and car-warriors and elephants, became<br>exceedingly loud and pitiable as these were heard on the field. When the<br>engagement became general, both side slew each other's own men and<br>animals. Hurled from the hands of heroes upon warriors and elephants,<br>heaps of swords were seen on the field, resembling heaps of cloths on the<br>washing ground. The sound, again, of uplifted and descending swords in<br>heroic arms resembled that of cloths thrashed for wash. That general<br>engagement then, in which the warriors encountered one another with<br>swords and scimitars and lances and battle-axes, became exceedingly<br>dreadful. The heroic combatants caused a river there, that ran its course<br>towards the regions of the dead. The blood of elephants and steeds and<br>human beings formed its current. Weapons formed its fish in profusion. It<br>was miry with blood and flesh. Wails of grief and pain formed its roar.<br>Banners and cloth formed its froth. Afflicted with shafts and darts, worn<br>with exertion, spent with toil on the (previous) night, and exceedingly<br>weakened, elephants and steeds, with limbs perfectly motionless, stood on<br>the field. With their arms (in beautiful attitudes) and with their<br>beautiful coats of mail, and heads decked with beautiful ear-rings, the<br>warriors, adorned with implements of battle, looked exceedingly<br>resplendent.[250] At that time, in consequence of the carnivorous animals<br>and the dead and the dying, there was no path for the cars all over the<br>field. Afflicted with shafts steeds of the noblest breed and high mettle,<br>resembling elephants (in size and strength), worn out with toil, were<br>seen to tremble with great effort, as they drew vehicles whose wheels had<br>sunk in the earth. The whole of that host, O Bharata, resembling the<br>ocean for vastness, then became agitated, and afflicted, inspired with<br>terror, with the exception only of Drona and Arjuna. Those two became the<br>refuge, these two became the saviours, of the warriors of their<br>respective sides. Others, encountering these two proceeded to the abode<br>of Yama. Then the vast host of the Kurus became greatly agitated, and the<br>Panchalas, huddled together, became no longer distinguishable. During<br>that great carnage of the Kshatriyas on earth, on that field of battle,<br>enhancing the terrors of the timid and looking like a crematorium neither<br>Karna, nor Drona, nor Arjuna, nor Yudhishthira, nor Bhimasena, nor the<br>twins, nor the Panchala prince, nor Satyaki, nor Duhsasana, nor Drona's<br>son, nor Duryodhana nor Suvala's son, nor Kripa, nor the ruler of the<br>Madras, nor Kritavarman, nor others, nor my own self, nor the earth, nor<br>points of the compass, could be seen, O king, for all of them, mingled<br>with the troops, were shrouded by clouds of dust. During the progress of<br>that fierce and terrible battle, when that dusty cloud arose, all thought<br>that night had once more come over the scene. Neither the Kauravas, nor<br>the Panchalas, nor the Pandavas, could be distinguished, nor the points<br>of the compass, nor the welkin, nor the earth, nor even land nor uneven<br>land. The warriors, desirous of victory, slew foes and friends, in fact,<br>all whom they could perceive by the touch of their hands. The earthly<br>dust that had arisen was soon dispelled by the winds that blew, and<br>drenched by the blood that was shed. Elephants and steeds and<br>car-warriors and foot-soldiers, bathed in blood, looked beautiful like<br>the (celestial) forest of Parijata. Then Duryodhana, Karna, Drona and<br>Duhsasana, these four (Kauravas) warriors engaged in battle with four of<br>the Pandava warriors, Duryodhana and his brothers, encountered the twins<br>(Nakula and Sahadeva). And Radha's son engaged himself with Vrikodara,<br>and Arjuna with the son of Bharadwaja, all the troops, from every side,<br>looked on that terrible encounter. The car-warriors (of both armies<br>quietly) beheld that beautiful, that superhuman engagement between those<br>fierce and foremost of car-warriors conversant with every mode of<br>warfare, riding on their own beautiful cars that performed diverse<br>delightful evolutions. Endued with great prowess, struggling vigorously,<br>and each solicitous of vanquishing the other, they covered each other<br>with showers of shafts, like the clouds at the close of summer (pouring<br>torrents of rain). Those bulls among men, riding on their cars of solar<br>effulgence, looked beautiful like congregated masses of clouds in the<br>autumnal sky. Then those warriors, O monarch, filled with wrath and<br>desire of revenge, mighty bowmen all, challenging, rushed at one another<br>with great vigour like infuriated leaders of elephantine herds. Verily, O<br>king, death does not take place till its hour comes, since all those<br>warriors did not simultaneously perish in that battle. Strewn with lopped<br>off arms and legs, and heads decked with beautiful ear-rings, and bows<br>and arrows and lances and scimitars and battle-axes and (other kinds of)<br>axes, and Nalihas and razor-headed arrows and cloth-yard shafts and darts<br>and diverse kinds of beautiful armour, and beautiful cars broken into<br>pieces, and slain elephants and standardless cars broken like cities, and<br>vehicles dragged hither and thither with the speed of the wind by<br>driverless steeds in great fright, and a large number of well-decked<br>warriors of great courage, and fallen fans and coats of mail and<br>standards, and ornaments and robes and fragrant garlands, and chains of<br>gold and diadems and crowns and head-gears and rows of bells, and jewels<br>worn on breasts, and cuirasses and collars and gems that adorn<br>head-gears, the field of battle looked beautiful like the firmament<br>bespangled with stars.'<br><br>'Then there occured an encounter between Duryodhana, filled with wrath<br>and desire of revenge, and Nakula filled with the same feelings. Madri's<br>son cheerfully shooting hundreds of shafts, placed thy son on his right.<br>At this loud cheers were bestowed upon him. Placed on the right by his<br>cousin-brother in wrath, thy son king Duryodhana, filled with rage,<br>began, in battle, to wonderfully counteract Nakula from that very side.<br>Thereupon, Nakula, endued with great energy and acquainted with the<br>diverse course (in which a car may be conducted), began to resist thy son<br>who was engaged in counteracting him from his right. Duryodhana, however,<br>afflicting Nakula with showers of shafts and resisting him on every side,<br>caused him to turn back. All the troops applauded that feat (of thy son).<br>Then Nakula, addressing thy son, said, 'Wait, Wait, recollecting all his<br>woes caused by thy evil counsels.'"
