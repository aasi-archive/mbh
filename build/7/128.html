                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'While mighty Bhimasena was uttering those loud<br>shouts deep as the roar of the clouds or peals of thunder, what heroes<br>(of our side) surrounded him? I do not behold that warrior, O Sanjaya, in<br>the three worlds, who is capable of staying before the enraged Bhimasena<br>in battle. I do not, O son, behold him that can stay on the field of<br>battle before Bhimasena armed with mace and resembling Death himself. Who<br>will stand before that Bhima, not excepting Sakra himself, that destroys<br>a car with a car and an elephant with an elephant?[153] Who, amongst<br>those devoted to Duryodhana's welfare stood in battle before Bhimasena<br>excited with rage and engaged in slaughtering my sons? Who were those men<br>that stood in battle in front of Bhimasena, engaged in consuming my sons<br>like a forest conflagration consuming dry leaves and straw? Who were they<br>that surrounded Bhima in battle, beholding my sons slain by him one after<br>another like Death himself cutting off all creatures? I do not fear<br>Arjuna so much, or Krishna so much, or Satyaki so much, or him (viz.,<br>Dhrishtadyumna) so much who was born of the sacrificial fire, as I fear<br>Bhima. Tell me, O Sanjaya, who were those heroes that rushed against that<br>blazing fire, represented by Bhima, which so consumed my sons?'<br><br>"Sanjaya, said, 'While the mighty car-warriors Bhimasena was uttering<br>those roars, mighty Karna, unable to bear them, rushed at him with a loud<br>shout, stretching his bow with great force. Indeed, the mighty Karna,<br>desirous of battle, displayed his strength and checked Bhima's course<br>like a tall tree withstanding tempest. The heroic Bhima also, beholding<br>Vikartana's son before him, suddenly blazed up in wrath and sped at him<br>with great force many shafts whetted on stone. Karna received all those<br>shafts and sped many in return. At that encounter between Bhima and<br>Karna, hearing the sounds of their palms, the limbs of all the struggling<br>combatants, car-warriors, and horsemen, began to tremble. Indeed, hearing<br>the terrible roars of Bhimasena on the field of battle, even all the<br>foremost of Kshatriyas regarded the whole earth and the welkin to be<br>filled with that noise. And at the fierce peals uttered by the<br>high-souled son of Pandu, the bows of all warriors in that battle dropped<br>on the earth. And steeds and elephants, O king, dispirited, ejected urine<br>and excreta. Various frightful omens of evil then made their appearance.<br>The welkin was covered with flights of vultures and Kankas during that<br>terrific encounter between Bhima and Karna. Then Karna struck Bhima with<br>twenty arrows, and quickly pierced the latter's charioteer also with<br>five. Smiling the while, the mighty and active Bhima then, in that<br>battle, quickly sped at Karna four and sixty arrows. Then Karna, O king,<br>sped four shafts at him. Bhima, by means of his straight shafts, cut them<br>into many fragments, O king, displaying his lightness of hand. Then Karna<br>covered him with dense showers of arrows. Thus covered by Karna, the<br>mighty son of Pandu, however, cut off Karna's bow at the handle and then<br>pierced Karna with ten straight arrows. The Suta's son then, that mighty<br>car-warrior of terrible deeds, taking up another bow and stringing it<br>quickly, pierced Bhima in that battle (with many shafts). Then Bhima,<br>excited with rage, struck the Suta's son with great force on the chest<br>with three straight shafts. With those arrows sticking at his breast,<br>Karna looked beautiful, O bull of Bharata's race, like a mountain with<br>three tall summits. Thus pierced with mighty shafts, blood began to flow<br>from his wounds, like torrents of liquid red-chalk down the breast of a<br>mountain. Afflicted with those shafts shot with great force, Karna became<br>agitated a little. Fixing an arrow then on his bow, he pierced Bhima,<br>again, O sire! And once more he began to shoot arrows by hundreds and<br>thousands. Suddenly shrouded with shafts by that firm bowman, viz.,<br>Karna, the son of Pandu, smiling the while, cut off Karna's bow-string.<br>And then with a broad-headed arrow, he despatched Karna's charioteer to<br>the abode of Yama. And that mighty car-warrior, viz., Bhima, deprived the<br>four steeds also of Karna of their lives. The mighty car-warrior Karna<br>then speedily jumping down, O king, from his steedless car, mounted the<br>car of Vrishasena. The valiant Bhimasena then, having vanquished Karna in<br>battle, uttered a loud shout deep as the roar of the clouds. Hearing that<br>roar, O Bharata, Yudhishthira became highly gratified, knowing that Karna<br>had been vanquished by Bhimasena. And the combatants of the Pandava army<br>blew their conchs from every side, Their enemies, viz., thy warriors,<br>hearing that noise, roared loudly. Arjuna stretched Gandiva, and Krishna<br>blew Panchajanya. Drowning, however, all those sounds, the noise made by<br>the roaring Bhima, was, O king, heard by all the combatants, O sire! Then<br>those two warriors, viz., Karna, and Bhima, each struck the other with<br>straight shafts. The son of Radha, however, shot shafts mildly, but the<br>son of Pandu shot his with great force.'"
