                            "Sanjaya said, 'Engaged in taking the lives of brave warriors, Arjuna's<br>son then resembled the Destroyer himself, when the latter takes the lives<br>of all creatures on the arrival of the Universal Dissolution. Possessed<br>of prowess resembling that of Sakra himself, the mighty son of Sakra's<br>son, viz., Abhimanyu, agitating the Katirava army looked exceedingly<br>resplendent. Penetrating into the Katirava host, O king, that destroyer<br>of foremost Kshatriyas resembling Yama himself, seized Satvasravas, like<br>an infuriated tiger seizing a deer. Beholding Satyasrayas, seized by him,<br>many mighty car-warriors, taking up diverse kinds of weapons, rushed upon<br>him. Indeed, those bulls among Kshatriyas, from a spirit of rivalry,<br>rushed at the son of Arjuna from desire of slaying him, all exclaiming,<br>'I shall go first, I shall go first!' As a whale in the sea obtaining a<br>shoal of small fish seizes them with the greatest ease, even so did<br>Abhimanyu receive that whole division of the rushing Kshatriyas. Like<br>rivers that never go back when they approach the sea, none amongst those<br>unretreating Kshatriyas turned back when they approached Abhimanyu. That<br>army then reeled like a boat tossed on the ocean when overtaken by a<br>mighty tempest, (with its crew) afflicted with panic caused by the<br>violence of the wind. Then the mighty Rukmaratha, son of the ruler of the<br>Madras, for assuring the frightened troops, fearlessly said, 'Ye heroes,<br>ye need not fear! When I am here, what is Abhimanyu? Without doubt, I<br>will seize this one a living captive'. Having said these words, the<br>valiant prince, borne on his beautiful and well-equipped car, rushed at<br>Abhimanyu. Piercing Abhimanyu with three shafts in the chest, three in<br>the right arm, and three other sharp shafts in the left arm, he uttered a<br>loud roar. Phalguni's son, however, cutting off his bow, his right and<br>left arms, and his head adorned with beautiful eyes and eye-brows quickly<br>felled them on the earth. Beholding Rukmaratha, the honoured son of<br>Salya, slain by the illustrious son of Subhadra, that Rukmaratha viz.,<br>who had vowed to consume his foe or take him alive, many princely friends<br>of Salya's son, O king, accomplished in smiting and incapable of being<br>easily defeated in battle, and owning standards decked with gold, (came<br>up for the fight). Those mighty car-warriors, stretching their bows full<br>six cubits long, surrounded the son of Arjuna, all pouring their arrowy<br>showers upon him. Beholding the brave and invincible son of Subhadra<br>singly encountered by all those wrathful princes endued with heroism and<br>skill acquired by practice and strength and youth, and seeing him covered<br>with showers of arrows, Duryodhana rejoiced greatly, and regarded<br>Abhimanyu as one already made a guest of Yama's abode. Within the<br>twinkling of an eye, those princes, by means of their shafts of golden<br>wings, and of diverse forms and great impetuosity, made Arjuna's son<br>invisible. Himself, his standard, and his car, O sire, were seen by us<br>covered with shafts like (trees overwhelmed with) flights of locusts.<br>Deeply pierced, he became filled with rage like an elephant struck with<br>the hook. He then, O Bharata, applied the Gandharva weapon and the<br>illusion consequent to it.[73] Practising ascetic penances, Arjuna had<br>obtained that weapon from the Gandharva Tumvuru and others. With that<br>weapon, Abhimanyu now confounded his foes. Quickly displaying his<br>weapons, he careered in that battle like a circle of fire, and was, O<br>king, seen sometimes as a single individual, sometimes as a hundred, and<br>sometimes as a thousand ones. Confounding his foes by the skill with<br>which his car was guided and by the illusion caused by his weapons, he<br>cut in a hundred pieces, O monarch, the bodies of the kings (opposed to<br>him). By means of his sharp shafts the lives of living creatures were<br>despatched. These, O king attained to the other world while their bodies<br>fell down on the earth. Their bows, and steeds and charioteers, and<br>standards, and armies decked with Angadar, and heads, the son of Phalguni<br>cut off with his sharp shafts. Those hundred princes were slain and<br>felled by Subhadra's son like a tope of five-year old mango-trees just on<br>the point of bearing fruit (laid low by a tempest). Beholding those<br>youthful princes brought up in every luxury, and resembling angry snakes<br>of virulent poison, all slain by the single-handed Abhimanyu, Duryodhana<br>was filled with fear. Seeing (his) car-warriors and elephants and steeds<br>and foot-soldiers crushed, the Kuru king quickly proceeded in wrath<br>against Abhimanyu. Continued for only a short space of time, the<br>unfinished battle between them became exceedingly fierce. Thy son then,<br>afflicted with Abhimanyu's arrows, was obliged to turn back from the<br>fight.'
