                            "Sanjaya said, 'After the slaughter of that hero, that leader of<br>car-divisions, viz., the son of Subhadra, the Pandava warriors, leaving<br>their cars and putting off their armour, and throwing aside their Lows,<br>sat, surrounding king Yudhishthira. And they were brooding over that<br>grief of theirs, their hearts fixed upon the (deceased) Abhimanyu.<br>Indeed, upon the fall of that heroic nephew of his, viz., the mighty<br>car-warrior Abhimanyu, king Yudhishthira, overwhelmed with grief,<br>indulged in (these) lamentations: 'Alas, Abhimanyu, from desire of<br>achieving my good, pierced the array formed by Drona and teeming with his<br>soldiers. Encountering him in battle, mighty bowmen endued with great<br>courage, accomplished in weapons and incapable of being easily defeated<br>in battle, were routed and forced to retreat. Encountering our implacable<br>foe Duhsasana in battle, he with his arrows, caused that warrior to fly<br>away from the field, deprived of his senses. Alas, the heroic son of<br>Arjuna, having crossed the vast sea of Drona's army, was ultimately<br>obliged to become a guest of Yama's abode, upon encountering the son of<br>Duhsasana. When Abhimanyu is slain, how shall I cast my eyes on Arjuna<br>and also the blessed Subhadra deprived of her favourite son? What<br>senseless, disjointed, and improper words shall we have to say today unto<br>Hrishikesa and Dhananjaya! Desirous of achieving what is good, and<br>expectant of victory, it is I who have done this great evil unto Subhadra<br>and Kesava and Arjuna. He that is covetous never beholdth his faults.<br>Covetousness spring from folly. Collectors of honey see not the fall that<br>is before them; I am even like them. He who was only a child, he who<br>should have been provided with (good) food, with vehicles, with beds,<br>with ornaments, alas, even he was placed by us in the van of battle. How<br>could good come to a child of tender years, unskilled in battle, in such<br>a situation of great danger. Like a horse on proud mettle, he sacrificed<br>himself instead of refusing to do the bidding of his master. Alas, we<br>also shall today lay ourselves down on the bare earth, blasted by the<br>glances of grief, cast by Arjuna filled with wrath. Dhananjaya liberal,<br>intelligent, modest, forgiving, handsome, mighty, possessed of<br>well-developed and beautiful limbs, respectful to superiors, heroic,<br>beloved, and devoted to truth; of glorious achievements' the very gods<br>applaud his feats. That valiant hero slew the Nivatakavachas and the<br>Kalakeyas, those enemies of Indra having their abode in Hiranyapura. In<br>the twinkling of an eye he slew the Paulomas with all their followers.<br>Endued with great might, he granteth quarter to implacable enemies asking<br>for quarter! Alas, we could not protect today the son of even such a<br>person from danger. A great fear hath overtaken the Dhartarashtras endued<br>though they might be with great strength![81] Enraged at the slaughter of<br>his son, Partha will exterminate the Kauravas. It is evident also that<br>the mean-minded Duryodhana having mean counsellors, that destroyer of his<br>own race and partisans, beholding this extermination of the Kaurava army,<br>will give up his life in grief. Beholding this son of Indra's son, of<br>unrivalled energy and prowess, on the field of battle, neither victory,<br>nor sovereignty, nor immortality, nor abode with the very celestials,<br>causeth me the least delight!'"
