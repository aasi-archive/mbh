                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'When the Suta's son had such a dart as was sure to<br>slay one person, why did he not hurt it at Partha, to the exclusion of<br>all others? Upon Partha's slaughter by means of that dart, all the<br>Srinjayas and the Pandavas would have been slain. Indeed, upon Phalguna's<br>death, why should not the victory have been ours? Arjuna has made a vow<br>to the effect that summoned to battle he would never refuse to accept the<br>challenge. The Suta's son should have, therefore, summoned Phalguna to<br>battle. Tell me, O Sanjaya, why did not Vrisha then engaging Phalguna in<br>single combat, slay the latter with that dart given him by Sakra? Without<br>doubt, my son is destitute of both intelligence and counsellors? That<br>sinful wretch is constantly baffled by the foe. How should he then<br>succeed in vanquishing his enemies? Indeed, that dart which was such a<br>mighty weapon and upon which rested his victory, alas, that dart, hath,<br>by Vasudeva, been made fruitless through Ghatotkacha. Indeed, it hath<br>been snatched from Karna, like a fruit from the hand of a cripple, with a<br>withered arm, by a strong person. Even so hath that fatal dart been<br>rendered fruitless through Ghatotkacha. As in a fight between a boar and<br>a dog, upon the death of either, the hunter is the party profited, I<br>think, O learned one, that even so was Vasudeva the party to profit by<br>the battle between Karna and Hidimva's son. If Ghatotkacha had slain<br>Karna in battle, that would have been a great gain for the Pandavas. If,<br>on the other hand, Karna had slain Ghatotkacha, that too would have been<br>a great gain to them in consequence of the loss of Karna's dart. Endued<br>with great wisdom, that lion among men, viz., Vasudeva, reflecting in<br>this way, and for doing what was agreeable to and good for the Pandavas,<br>caused Ghatotkacha to be slain by Karna in battle.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Knowing the feat that Karna desired to achieve, the<br>slayer of Madhu, the mighty-armed Janardana, O king, commanded the prince<br>of the Rakshasas, Ghatotkacha of mighty energy, to engage in single<br>combat with Karna for rendering, O monarch, the latter's fatal dart<br>fruitless. All this, O king, is the result of thy evil policy! We would<br>certainly have achieved success, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, if Krishna<br>had not (thus) rescued the mighty car-warrior Partha from Karna's hands.<br>Indeed, Partha would have been destroyed with his steeds, standard, and<br>car, in battle, Oh Dhritarashtra, if that master, that lord of Yogins,<br>viz., Janardana had not saved him. Protected by diverse means, O king,<br>and well-aided by Krishna, Partha approaching his foes, vanquished that<br>fatal dart, otherwise that weapon would have quickly destroyed the son of<br>Kunti like the lightning destroying a tree.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'My son is fond of quarrel. His advisers are<br>foolish. He is vain of his wisdom. It is for that, that this certain<br>means of Arjuna's death hath been baffled. Why, O Suta, did not<br>Duryodhana, or that foremost of all wielders, viz., Karna, possessed of<br>great intelligence, hurl that fatal dart at Dhananjaya? Why, O son of<br>Gavalgana, didst thou too forget this great object, possessed as thou art<br>of great wisdom, or why didst not thou remind Karna of it?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Indeed, O king, every night this formed the subject of<br>deliberation with Duryodhana and Sakuni and myself and Duhsasana. And we<br>said unto Karna, 'Excluding all other warriors, O Karna, slay Dhananjaya.<br>We would then lord it over the Pandu's and the Panchalas as if these were<br>our slaves. Or, if upon Partha's fall, he of Vrishni's race appoints<br>another amongst the sons of Pandu (in this place for carrying on the<br>fight), let Krishna himself be slain. Krishna is the root of the<br>Pandavas, and Partha is like their risen trunk. The other sons of Pritha<br>are like their branches, while the Panchalas may be called their leaves.<br>The Pandavas have Krishna for their refuge, Krishna for their might,<br>Krishna for their leader. Indeed, Krishna is their central support even<br>as the moon is of the constellations. Therefore, O Suta's son, avoiding<br>the leaves and branches and trunk, slay that Krishna who is everywhere<br>and always the root of the Pandavas. Indeed, if Karna had slain him of<br>Dasarha's race, viz., that delighter of the Yadavas, the whole earth, O<br>king, would, without doubt, have come under thy control. Truly, O<br>monarch, if that illustrious one, that delighter of both the Yadavas and<br>the Pandavas, could be made to lie down on the earth, deprived of life,<br>then certainly, O monarch, the entire earth with the mountains and<br>forests would have owned thy supremacy. We rose every morning, having<br>formed such a resolution in respect of that Lord of the very gods, viz.,<br>Hrishikesa of immeasurable energy. At the time of battle, however, we<br>forget our resolution. Kesava always protected Arjuna, the son of Kunti.<br>He never placed Arjuna before the Suta's son in battle. Indeed, Achyuta<br>always placed other foremost of car-warriors before Karna, thinking how<br>that fatal dart of ours might be made fruitless by ourselves. O lord!<br>When, again, the high-souled Krishna protected Partha in this manner from<br>Karna, why, O monarch, would not that foremost of beings protect his own<br>self? Reflecting well, I see that there is no person in the three worlds<br>who is able to vanquish that chastiser of foes, viz., Janardana, that<br>hero bearing the discus in hand.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'That tiger among car-warriors, viz., Satyaki of<br>prowess incapable of being baffled, asked the mighty-armed Krishna about<br>the great car-warrior, Karna, saving, 'O Janardana, even this had been<br>Karna's firm resolution, viz., that he would hurl that dart of<br>immeasurable energy at Phalguna. Why, however, did not the Suta's son<br>actually hurt it then at him?'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'Duhsasana and Karna and Sakuni and the ruler of the<br>Sindhus, with Duryodhana at their head, had frequently debated on this<br>subject. Addressing Karna, they used to say, 'O Karna. O great bowman, O<br>thou of immeasurable prowess in battle, O foremost of all victors, this<br>dart should not be hurled at any one else than that great car-warrior,<br>viz., Kunti's son, Partha or Dhananjaya. He is the most celebrated<br>amongst them, like Vasava amongst the gods. He being slain, all the other<br>Pandavas with the Srinjayas will be heartless like fireless<br>celestials![239]' Karna having assented to this, saying 'So be it' (the<br>desire of) slaughtering the wielder of Gandiva, O bull amongst the Sinis,<br>was ever present in Karna's heart. I, however, O foremost of warriors,<br>always used to stupefy the son of Radha. It was for this that he did not<br>hurl the dart at Pandu's son, owning white steeds. As long as I could not<br>baffle that means of Phalguna's death, I had neither sleep, nor joy in my<br>heart, O foremost of warriors! Beholding that dart, therefore, rendered<br>futile through Ghatotkacha, O bull amongst the Sinis, I regarded<br>Dhananjaya today to have been rescued from within the jaws of Death. I do<br>not regard my sire, my mother, yourselves, my brothers, ay, my very life,<br>so worthy of protection as Vibhatsu in battle. If there be anything more<br>precious than the sovereignty of the three worlds, I do not, O Satwata,<br>desire (to enjoy) it without Pritha's son, Dhananjaya (to share it with<br>me). Beholding Dhananjaya, therefore, like one returned from the dead,<br>these transports of delight, O Yuyudhana, have been mine. It was for this<br>that I had despatched the Rakshasa unto Karna for battle. None else was<br>capable of withstanding, in the night, Karna in battle.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Even thus did Devaki's son who is ever devoted to<br>Dhananjaya's good and to what is agreeable to him, speak unto Satyaki on<br>that occasion.'"
