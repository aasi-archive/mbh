                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'After the ruler of the Sindhus had been slain in<br>battle by Savyasachin and after the fall of Bhurisravas, what became the<br>state of your mind? After Drona also had been thus addressed by<br>Duryodhana in the midst of the Kurus, what did the preceptor say unto him<br>then? Tell me all this, O Sanjaya!'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Loud wails arose among thy coops, O Bharata, after the<br>slaughter of Bhurisravas and the ruler of the Sindhus. All of them<br>disregarded the counsels of thy son, those counsels in consequence of<br>which leaders of men, by hundreds, were slain, As regards Drona, hearing<br>those words of thy son, he became filled with grief. Reflecting for a<br>short while, O monarch, he said these words in great affliction.<br><br>"Drona said, O Duryodhana, why dost thou pierce me thus with wordy<br>shafts? I told thee before that Arjuna is incapable of defeat in battle.<br>Protected by the diadem-decked Arjuna, Sikhandin slew Bhishma. By that<br>feat, O thou of Kuru's race, the prowess of Arjuna in battle hath been<br>well-tested. Beholding Bhisma who was incapable of being defeated by the<br>gods and the Danavas, actually slain in battle, even then I knew that<br>this Bharata host is doomed. Upon the fall of him whom of all persons in<br>the three worlds, we had regarded to be the very foremost of heroes, who<br>else is there upon whom we are to rely? Those dice, O sire, with which<br>Sakuni formerly played in the Kuru assembly, were not dice but keen<br>arrows capable of slaying foes. Even those arrows, O sire, sped by Jaya,<br>are now slaying us. Though Vidura characterised them to be such, thou<br>didst not yet understand them to be so. Those words, again, that the wise<br>and high-souled Vidura, with tears in his eyes had then said unto thee,<br>those auspicious words recommending peace, thou didst not then hear. That<br>calamity which foretold hath now come. That frightful carnage, O<br>Duryodhana, hath now come as the result of that disobedience by thee of<br>Vidura's words. That man of foolish understanding who, disregarding the<br>salutary words of trusted friends, followeth his own opinion, soon falls<br>into a pitiable plight. O son of Gandhari, this great evil, viz., that<br>dragging in our very sight to the Kuru assembly of Krishna who never<br>deserved such treatment, who hath been born in a noble race, and who<br>practiseth every virtue. Know that all this is but little, for in the<br>next world dire consequences yet will be thine. Vanquishing the Pandavas<br>at dice by deceit, thou hadst sent them, into the woods, attired in<br>deer-skins. What other Brahmana, except myself, in this world, would seek<br>to injure those princes that are ever engaged in the practice of virtue<br>and that are to me even as my own sons" With the approval of<br>Dhritarashtra, in the midst of the Kuru assembly, thou hadst, with Sakuni<br>as thy help-mate, provoked the ire of the Pandavas. United with<br>Duhsasana, Karna then fanned that wrath. Disregarding the words of<br>Vidura, thou hast repeatedly fanned it thyself. With resolute care, all<br>of you had surrounded Arjuna, resolved to stand by the ruler of the<br>Sindhus. Why then have all of you been vanquished and why also has<br>Jayadratha been slain? Why, when thou art alive, and Karna, and Kripa,<br>and Salya, and Aswatthaman, O Kauravya, hath the ruler of the Sindhus<br>been slain? For rescuing the ruler of the Sindhus, the kings (on thy<br>side) had put forth all their fierce energy. Why, then, hath Jayadratha<br>been slain in their midst? Relying upon me, king Jayadratha had expected<br>his rescue from the hands of Arjuna. He, however, obtained not the rescue<br>he had expected. I do not also see my safety for my own self. Until I<br>succeed in slaying the Panchalas with Sikhandin, I feel like one sinking<br>in the Dhristadyumna-mire. Having failed, O Bharata, in rescuing the<br>ruler of the Sindhus, why dost thou pierce me thus with thy wordy shafts,<br>seeing that I too am burning with grief? Thou seest not any longer on the<br>field the gold standards of Bhishma of sure aim, that warrior who was<br>never tired in battle. How, then, canst thou hope for success? When the<br>ruler of the Sindhus and Bhurisravas also have been slain in the very<br>midst of so many mighty car-warriors, what do you think, will the end be?<br>Kripa, difficult of being vanquished, is still alive, O king! That he<br>hath not followed in the track of Jayadratha, I applaud him highly for<br>this! When I saw Bhishma himself, that achiever of the most difficult<br>feats (in battle), that warrior who was incapable of being slain in<br>battle by the gods with Vasava at their head, slain in thy sight, O<br>Kaurava, as also of thy younger brother Duhsasana, I thought then, O<br>king, that the Earth hath abandoned thee. Yonder the troops of the<br>Pandavas and the Srinjayas, united together, are now rushing against me.<br>For achieving thy good in battle, O son of Dhritarashtra, I will not<br>without slaying all the Panchalas, put off my armour. O king, go and tell<br>my son Aswatthaman who is present in battle that even at the risk of his<br>life he should not let the Somakas alone.[186] Thou shouldst also tell<br>him, 'Observe all the instructions thou hast received from thy father. Be<br>firm in acts of humility, in self-restraint, in truth and righteousness.<br>Observant of religion, profit, and pleasure, without neglecting religion<br>and profit, thou shouldst always accomplish those acts in which religion<br>predominates. The Brahmanas should always be gratified with presents. All<br>of them deserve thy worship. Thou shouldst never do anything that is<br>injurious to them. They are like flames of fire. As regards myself, I<br>will penetrate the hostile host, O slayer of foes, for doing great<br>battle, pierced as I am by thee with thy wordy shafts. If thou canst, O<br>Duryodhana, go and protect those troops. Both the Kurus and the Srinjayas<br>have been angry. They will fight even during the night.' Having said<br>these words, Drona proceeded against the Pandavas and set himself to<br>over-ride the energy of the Kshatriyas like the sun overshadowing the<br>light of the stars.'"
