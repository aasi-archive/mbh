                            -Sanjaya said, 'After that army had (thus) been routed, and Arjuna and<br>Bhimasena had all gone after the ruler of the Sindhus, thy son<br>(Duryodhana) proceeded towards Drona. And Duryodhana went to the<br>preceptor, on his single car, thinking, by the way, of diverse duties.<br>That car of thy son, endued with the speed of the wind or thought,<br>proceeded with great celerity towards Drona. With eyes red in wrath, thy<br>son addressed the preceptor and said, 'O grinder of foes, Arjuna and<br>Bhimasena, and unvanquished Satyaki, and many mighty car-warriors,<br>defeating all our troops, have succeeded in approaching the ruler of the<br>Sindhus. Indeed, those mighty car-warriors, who vanquished all the<br>troops, themselves unvanquished, are fighting even there. O giver of<br>honours, how hast thou been transgressed by both Satyaki and Bhima? O<br>foremost of Brahmanas, this thy defeat at the hands of Satwata, of<br>Arjuna, and of Bhimasena, is like the drying of the ocean, exceedingly<br>wonderful in this world. People are loudly asking, 'How, indeed, could<br>Drona, that master of the science of arms, be vanquished?' Even thus all<br>the warriors are speaking in depreciation of thee. Destruction is certain<br>for my luckless self in battle, when three car-warriors, O tiger among<br>men, have if, succession transgressed thee. When, however, all this hath<br>happened, tell us what thou hast to say on the business that awaits us.<br>What hath happened, is past. O giver of honours, think now of what is<br>remaining. Say quickly what should next be done for the ruler of the<br>Sindhus on the present occasion, and let what thou sayest be quickly and<br>properly carried out.'<br><br>"Drona said, 'Listen, O great king, to what I, having reflected much, say<br>unto thee about what should now be done. As yet only three great<br>car-warriors among the Pandavas have transgressed us. We have as much to<br>fear behind those three as we have to dread before them.[154] There,<br>however, where Krishna and Dhananjaya are, our fear must be greater. The<br>Bharata army hath been attacked both on the front and from behind. In<br>this pass, I think, the protection of the ruler of the Sindhus is our<br>first duty. Jayadratha, afraid of Dhananjaya, deserves of everything else<br>to be protected by us. The heroic Yuyudhana and Vrikodara have both gone<br>against the ruler of the Sindhus. All this that hath come is the fruit of<br>that match at dice conceived by Sakuni's intellect. Neither victory nor<br>defeat took place in the (gaming) assembly. Now that we are engaged in<br>this sport, there will be victory or defeat. Those innocent things with<br>which Sakuni had formerly played in the Kuru assembly and which he<br>regarded as dice, were, in reality, invincible shafts. Truly, there<br>where, O sire, the Kauravas were congregated, they were not dice but<br>terrible arrows capable of mangling your bodies. At present, however, O<br>king, know the combatants for players, these shafts for dice, and the<br>ruler of the Sindhus, without doubt, O monarch, as the stake, in this<br>game of battle. Indeed, Jayadratha is the great stake about which we are<br>playing today with the enemy. Under the circumstances, therefore, O<br>monarch, all of us becoming reckless of our very lives, should make due<br>arrangements for the protection of the ruler of the Sindhus in battle.<br>Engaged as we are in our present sport, it is here that we shall have<br>victory or defeat, here, that is, where those great bowmen are protecting<br>the ruler of the Sindhus. Go thither, therefore, with speed, and protect<br>those protectors (of Jayadratha). As regards myself, I will stay here,<br>for despatching others (to the presence of Jayadratha) and checking the<br>Panchalas, the Pandus and the Srinjayas united together. Thus commanded<br>by the preceptor, Duryodhana quickly proceeded (to the place indicated)<br>with his followers, resolutely setting himself to (the accomplishment of)<br>a fierce task. The two protectors of the wheels of Arjuna's car, viz.,<br>the Panchala princes, Yudhamanyu and Uttamaujas, were at that time<br>proceeding towards Savyasachin by the skirts of the Kuru array. Thou<br>mayest remember, O king, that formerly while Arjuna penetrated thy host<br>from desire of battle, those two princes, O monarch, had been checked in<br>their progress by Kritavarman. Now, the Kuru king beheld them proceeding<br>by the skirts of his host. The mighty Duryodhana of Bharata's race lost<br>no time in engaging in a fierce battle with those two brothers thus<br>rushing furiously. Those two foremost of Kshatriyas, reputed as mighty<br>car-warriors, then rushed in that battle at Duryodhana, with outstretched<br>bows. Yudhamanyu pierced Duryodhana with twenty, and his four steeds with<br>four shafts. Duryodhana, however, with a single shaft, cut off<br>Yudhamanyu's standard. And thy son then cut off the former's bow also<br>with another shaft. And then with a broad-headed arrow, the Kuru king<br>felled Yudhamanyu's charioteer from his niche in the car. And then he<br>pierced the four steeds of the latter with four shafts. Then Yudhamanyu,<br>excited with wrath, quickly sped, in that battle, thirty shafts at the<br>centre of thy son's chest. Then Uttamaujas also, excited with wrath,<br>pierced Duryodhana's charioteer with shafts decked with gold, and<br>despatched him to Yama's abode. Duryodhana also, O monarch, then slew the<br>four steeds as also the two Parshni charioteers of Uttamaujas, the prince<br>of Panchalas. Then Uttamaujas, in that battle, becoming steedless and<br>driverless, quickly ascended the car of his brother, Yudhamanyu.<br>Ascending on the car of his brother, he struck Duryodhana's steeds with<br>many shafts. Slain therewith, those steeds fell down on the earth. Upon<br>the fall of his steeds, the valiant Yudhamanyu then, by a mighty weapon,<br>quickly cut off Duryodhana's bow and then (with another shaft), his<br>leathern fence. That bull among men then, viz., thy son, jumping down<br>from that steedless and driverless car, took up a mace and proceeded<br>against the two princes of Panchala. Beholding that subjugator of hostile<br>town, thus advancing in wrath, both Yudhamanyu and Uttamaujas jumped down<br>from the terrace of their car. Then Duryodhana armed as he was with a<br>mace, pressed down into the earth with that mace that foremost of cars<br>furnished with gold, with steeds and driver and standard. Thy son then,<br>that scorcher of foes, having thus crushed that car, steedless and<br>driverless as he himself was, quickly ascended the car of the king of the<br>Madras. Meanwhile, those two mighty car-warriors, viz., those two<br>foremost Panchala princes, ascending on two other cars, proceeded towards<br>Arjuna.'"
