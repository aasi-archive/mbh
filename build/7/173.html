                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then Karna, that slayer of hostile heroes, beholding<br>Prishata's son in battle, struck him on the chest with ten shafts capable<br>of penetrating into the very vitals. Dhrishtadyumna quickly pierced Karna<br>in return in that great battle, with five shafts, and addressing him,<br>said, Wait! Wait!' Shrouding each other in that dreadful combat with<br>showers of arrows, O king, they once more pierced each other with keen<br>shafts, sped from bows drawn to their fullest stretch. Then Karna, in<br>that battle, despatched to Yama's abode the driver and the four steeds or<br>Dhrishtadyumna, that foremost warrior among the Panchalas. He then cut<br>off his enemy's foremost bow with keen arrows, and felled, with a<br>broad-headed shaft the latter's driver from his niche in the car. Then<br>the valiant Dhrishtadyumna, deprived of car, steeds, and driver, quickly<br>jumped down from his car and took up a mace. Though struck all the while<br>with straight shafts by Karna, the Panchala prince, approaching Karna,<br>slew the four steeds of the latter. Turning back with great speed, that<br>slayer of hosts, viz., the son of Prishata, quickly ascended the car of<br>Dhananjaya. Mounting upon that car, the mighty car-warrior Dhrishtadyumna<br>desired to proceed towards Karna. Dharma's son (Yudhishthira), however,<br>bade him desist. Then Karna endued with great energy, mingling his<br>leonine shouts with it twanged his bow loudly and blew his conch with<br>great force. Beholding Prishata's son vanquished in battle, those mighty<br>car-warriors, viz., the Panchalas and the Somakas, excited with rage, and<br>taking up all kinds of weapons, proceeded, making death itself their<br>goal, towards Karna, from desire of slaughtering him. Meanwhile, Karna's<br>driver had yoked other steeds unto his master's car, that were white as<br>conchs, endued with great speed, of the Sindhu breed, and well-broken.<br>Then Karna of sure aim, contending with vigour, afflicted those mighty<br>car-warriors among the Panchalas with his shafts like a cloud pouring<br>torrents of rain upon a mountain. The Panchala host, thus afflicted by<br>Karna, fled away in fear, like a doe frightened by a lion. Horsemen were<br>seen falling from their horses, and elephant-riders from their elephants,<br>O monarch, and car-warriors from cars, all around. In that dreadful<br>battle, Karna cut off with razor-faced arrows the arms of flying<br>combatants and heads decked with car-rings. And he cut off, O king, the<br>thighs of others that were on elephants or on the back of steeds, or on<br>the earth, O sire! Many mighty car-warriors, as they fled away, felt not<br>their loss of limbs or the injury in their animals, in that battle.<br>Slaughtered by terrible shafts, the Panchalas and the Srinjayas took the<br>motion of even a straw for Karna (so great was their fright). Deprived of<br>their senses, the warriors took their flying friends for Karna and fled<br>away from these in fear. Karna pursued the broken and retreating host, O<br>Bharata, shooting his shafts on all sides. Indeed, in that battle, the<br>retreating warriors, deprived of their senses, were slaughtered with<br>mighty weapons by that illustrious hero, Karna. Others, only looked at by<br>Drona, fled away on all sides. Then king Yudhishthira, beholding his army<br>flying away, and regarding retreat to be advisable, addressed Phalguna<br>and said, 'Behold that mighty bowman, Karna stationed there like Rudra<br>himself armed with his bow. Behold him scorching everything around like<br>the blazing sun himself, at this fierce hour, this dead of night. These<br>wails are being incessantly heard, O Partha, of thy helpless friends who<br>are uttering them, mangled by the shafts of Karna. The manner in which<br>Karna is aiming and letting off his shafts is such that no interval can<br>be noticed between the two acts. He will, O Partha, annihilate all our<br>friends. Do that now, Dhananjaya, about the slaughter of Karna, which,<br>according to thy judgment, should next be done and the time for which may<br>have come.' Thus addressed (by Yudhishthira), Partha said unto Krishna,<br>'The royal son of Dharma is frightened today by the prowess of Karna.<br>When Karna's division is thus acting (towards us) repeatedly, do thou<br>speedily adopt that course which should now be adopted. Our army is<br>flying away, O slayer of Madhu, our troops, broken and mangled with<br>Drona's shafts and frightened by Karna, are unable to make a stand. I see<br>Karna careering fearlessly. Our foremost of car-warriors are flying away.<br>Karna is scattering his keen shafts. I cannot, like a snake incapable of<br>putting up with the tread of a human being upon its body, bear to see him<br>thus careering at the head of battle, before my eyes, O tiger of<br>Vrishni's race. Proceed, therefore, to that spot where the mighty<br>car-warrior Karna is. I will either kill him, O slayer of Madhu, or let<br>him slay me.'[229]<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'I behold Karna, O son of Kunti, that tiger among men,<br>that warrior of superhuman prowess, careering in battle like the chief of<br>the celestials himself. O Dhananjaya, there is none else capable of<br>advancing against him in battle, save thee, O tiger among men, and the<br>Rakshasa Ghatotkacha. I do not, however, O sinless one, regard the time<br>to have come, O mighty-armed one, for thee to encounter the Suta's son in<br>battle. The blazing dart, resembling a mighty meteor, given him by<br>Vasava, is still with him, O thou of mighty arms, kept for thee with<br>care, by the Suta's son. He keepeth that dart by him, and hath now<br>assumed a terrible form. As regards Ghatotkacha, he is always devoted to<br>you and desirous of your good. Let the mighty Ghatotkacha proceed against<br>the son of Radha. Endued with the prowess of a celestial, he has been<br>begotten by the mighty Bhima. With him are celestial weapons as also<br>those used by Rakshasa. The latter soon came before him, clad in mail,<br>and armed, O king, with sword arrow, and bow. Saluting Krishna and also<br>Dhananjaya, the son of Pandu, he proudly said, 'Here I am, command me.'<br>Then he of Dasarha's race, addressed Hidimva's son, that Rakshasa of<br>blazing mouth and fiery eyes and body of the hue of clouds, and said<br>these words, 'Listen, O Ghatotkacha, attend to what I say. The time is<br>come for the display of thy prowess, and not of anybody else. Be thou the<br>raft in this battle to the sinking Pandavas. Thou hast diverse weapons,<br>and many kinds of Rakshasa illusion. Behold, O son of Hidimva, the army<br>of the Pandavas is being beaten by Karna on the field of battle, like a<br>herd of kine by the herdsman. Yonder, the mighty bowman Karna, endued<br>with great intelligence and steady prowess, is scorching the foremost of<br>Kshatriyas among the divisions of the Pandava host. Afflicted by his<br>fiery arrows, the Pandava warriors are incapable of standing in front of<br>that firm bowman who is shooting showers of mighty shafts. Afflicted at<br>dead of night by the Suta's son with his arrowy showers, the Panchalas<br>are flying away like a herd of deer afflicted by a loin. Except thee, O<br>thou of terrible prowess, there is none else that can withstand the<br>Suta's son who is thus engaged in battle. Aided by thy energy and might,<br>do thou, O mighty-armed one, accomplish that which is worthy of thy own<br>self, of thy maternal race, and of thy sires. It is even for this, O son<br>of Hidimva, that men desire children, viz., for being rescued from<br>difficulties. Do thou now rescue thy kinsmen. O Ghatotkacha, sires desire<br>sons for achieving their own objects. Children, those sources of good,<br>are expected to rescue their sires both here and hereafter. Illustrious<br>thou art, and thy might in battle is terrible and unrivalled, while<br>contending in battle, there is none equal to thee. O scorcher of foes, be<br>thou the means by which the Pandavas who are routed by Karna with his<br>shafts this night, and who are now sinking in the Dhartarashtra ocean,<br>may safely reach the shore. At night, Rakshasas, again, become endued<br>with unlimited prowess, great might, and great courage. They become (at<br>such an hour) warriors of great valour and incapable of defeat. Slay<br>Karna in battle, at this dead of night, aided by thy illusions. The<br>Parthas, with Dhrishtadyumna, will dispose of Drona.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing those words of Kesava, Vibhatsu also, O<br>Kauravya, said these words unto that chastiser of foes, viz., the<br>Rakshasa Ghatotkacha, 'O Ghatotkacha, thyself, the long-armed Satyaki,<br>and Bhimasena, the son of Pandu, these three, in my judgment, are the<br>foremost ones among all our warriors. Go and encounter Karna in single<br>combat this night. The mighty car-warrior Satyaki will protect thy rear.<br>Assisted by Satwata hero, slay brave Karna in battle, as Indra in days of<br>old had slain (the Asura) Taraka, aided by (the celestial generalissimo)<br>Skanda.'<br><br>"Ghatotkacha said, 'I am match for Karna, as also for Drona, O Bharata,<br>or for any illustrious Kshatriya accomplished in weapons. This night I<br>shall fight such a battle with the Suta's son as will form the subject of<br>talk as long as the world lasts. Tonight, I will spare neither the brave<br>nor the timid nor those that will, with joined hands, pray for quarter.<br>Following the Rakshasa usage, I shall slay all.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, Having said these words, that slayer of hostile<br>heroes, viz., the son of Hidimva, rushed against Karna in that dreadful<br>fight frightening thy troops. The Suta's son, that tiger among men,<br>smilingly received that angry warrior of blazing mouth and blazing locks.<br>The battle then that took place between Karna and that Rakshasa, both<br>roaring against each other, O tiger among kings, resembled that between<br>Indra and Prahlada (in days of yore).'
