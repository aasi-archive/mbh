                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'That which thou tellest me, O Suta, about the<br>battle, fierce and terrible, between the one and the many, and the<br>victory of that illustrious one, that story of the prowess of Subhadra's<br>son is highly wonderful and almost incredible. I do not, however, regard<br>it as a marvel that is absolutely beyond belief in the case of those that<br>have righteousness for their refuge. After Duryodhana was beaten back and<br>a hundred princes slain, what course was pursued by the warriors of my<br>army against the son of Subhadra?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Their mouths became dry, and eyes restless. Sweat covered<br>their bodies, and their hairs stood on their ends. Despairing of<br>vanquishing their foe, they became ready to leave the field. Abandoning<br>their wounded brothers and sires and sons and friends and relatives by<br>marriage and kinsmen they fled, urging their steeds and elephants to<br>their utmost speed. Beholding them broken and routed, Drona and Drona's<br>son, and Vrihadvala, and Kripa, and Duryodhana, and Karna, and<br>Kritavarman, and Suvala's son (Sakuni), rushed in great wrath against the<br>unvanquished son of Subhadra. Almost all these, O king, were beaten back<br>by thy grandson. Only one warrior then, viz., Lakshmana, brought up in<br>luxury, accomplished in arrows, endued with great energy, and fearless in<br>consequence of inexperience and pride, proceeded against the son of<br>Arjuna. Anxious about his son, his father (Duryodhana) turned back for<br>following him. Other mighty car warriors, turned back for following<br>Duryodhana. All of them then drenched Abhimanyu with showers of arrows,<br>like clouds pouring rain on the mountain-breast. Abhimanyu, however,<br>single-handed, began to crush them like the dry wind that blows in every<br>direction destroying gathering masses of clouds. Like one infuriated<br>elephant encountering another, Arjuna's son then encountered thy<br>invincible grandson, Lakshmana, of great personal beauty, endued with<br>great bravery, staying near his father with outstretched bow, brought up<br>in every luxury, and resembling a second prince of the Yakshas[74].<br>Encountering Lakshmana, that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the son of<br>Subhadra, had his two arms and chest struck with his sharp shafts. Thy<br>grandson, the mighty-armed Abhimanyu then, filled with rage like a snake<br>struck (with a rod), addressing, O king, thy (other) grandson, said,<br>'Look well on this world, for thou shalt (soon) have to go to the other.<br>In the very sight of all thy kinsmen, I will despatch thee to Yama's<br>abode.' Saying thus that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the mighty-armed<br>son of Subhadra, took out a broad-headed arrow that resembled a snake<br>just emerged from its slough. That shaft, sped by Abhimanyu's arms, cut<br>off the beautiful head, decked with ear-rings, of Lakshmana, that was<br>graced with a beautiful nose, beautiful eye-brows, and exceedingly<br>good-looking curls. Beholding Lakshmana slain, thy troops uttered<br>exclamations of Oh and, Alas. Upon the slaughter of his dear son,<br>Duryodhana became filled with rage. That bull among Kshatriyas then<br>loudly urged the Kshatriyas under him, saying, 'Slay this one!' Then<br>Drona, and Kripa, and Karna, and Drona's son and Vrihadvala, and<br>Kritavarman, the son of Hridika,&#8212;these six car-warriors,&#8212;-encompassed<br>Abhimanyu. Piercing them with sharp arrows and beating them off from him,<br>the son of Arjuna fell with great speed and fury upon the vast forces of<br>Jayadratha. Thereupon, the Kalingas, the Nishadas, and the valiant son of<br>Kratha, all clad in mail, cut off his path by encompassing him with their<br>elephant-division. The battle then that took place between Phalguni's son<br>and those warriors was obstinate and fierce. Then the son of Arjuna began<br>to destroy that elephant-division as the wind coursing in every direction<br>destroys vast masses of gathering clouds in the welkin. Then Kratha<br>covered the son of Arjuna with showers of arrows, while many other<br>car-warriors headed by Drona, having returned to the field, rushed at<br>him, scattering sharp and mighty weapons. Checking all those weapons by<br>means of his own arrows, the son of Arjuna began to afflict the son of<br>Kratha with ceaseless showers of shafts, with great despatch and inspired<br>by the desire of slaying his antagonist. The latter's bow and shafts, and<br>bracelets, and arms, and head decked with diadem, and umbrella, and<br>standard, and charioteer, and steeds, were all cut off and felled by<br>Abhimanyu. When Kratha's son, possessed of nobility of lineage, good<br>behaviour, acquaintance with the scriptures, great strength, fame, and<br>power of arms, was slain, the other heroic combatants almost all turned<br>away from the fight.'"[75]
