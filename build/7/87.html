                            "Sanjaya said, 'After that fight had passed away, Drona, that foremost of<br>all wielders of weapons, began to array all his divisions for battle.<br>Diverse sounds were heard, O monarch of angry heroes shouting in wrath<br>and desirous of slaying one another. And some stretched their bows, and<br>some rubbed with their hands their bow-strings. And drawing deep breaths,<br>many of them shouted, saying, Where is that Dhananjaya? And some began to<br>throw upwards (and again seize) their naked swords, unyielding,<br>well-tempered, of the colour of the sky, possessed of great sharpness,<br>and furnished with beautiful hilts. And brave warriors, desirous of<br>battle, by thousands, were seen to perform the evolutions of swordmen and<br>of bowmen, with skill acquired by practice. Some whirling their maces<br>decked with bells, smeared with sandal paste, and adorned with gold and<br>diamonds enquired after the sons of Pandu. Some intoxicated with the<br>pride of strength, and possessed of massive arms, obstructed the welkin<br>with their spiked clubs that resembled (a forest of flag) staff raised in<br>honour of Indra. Others, brave warriors all, adorned with beautiful<br>garlands of flowers, desirous of battle, occupied diverse portions of the<br>field, armed with diverse weapons. 'Where is Arjuna? Where is that<br>Govinda? Where is proud Bhima? Where also are those allies of their?'<br>Even thus did they call upon them in battle. Then blowing his conch and<br>himself urging the horses to great speed, Drona moved about with great<br>celerity, arraying his troops. After all those divisions that delight in<br>battle had taken up their stations, Bharadwaja's son, O king, said these<br>words unto Jayadratha. 'Thyself, Somadatta's son, the mighty car-warrior<br>Karna, Aswatthaman, Salya, Vrishasena and Kripa, with a hundred thousand<br>horse, sixty thousand cars, four and ten thousand elephants with rent<br>temples, one and twenty thousand foot-soldiers clad in mail take up your<br>station behind me at the distance of twelve miles. There the very gods<br>with Vasava at their head will not be able to attack thee, what need be<br>said, therefore, of the Pandavas? Take comfort, O ruler of the Sindhus.<br>Thus addressed (by Drona), Jayadratha, the ruler of the Sindhus, became<br>comforted. And he proceeded to the spot indicated by Drona, accompanied<br>by many Gandhara warriors, and surrounded by those great car-warriors,<br>and with many foot-soldiers clad in mail, prepared to fight vigorously<br>and armed with nooses. The steeds of Jayadratha, well-skilled in bearing<br>of drawing were all, O monarch, decked with yalk-tails and ornaments of<br>gold. And seven thousand such steeds, and three thousand other steeds of<br>the Sindhu breed were with him.'<br><br>"Thy son Durmarshana, desirous of doing battle, stationed himself at the<br>head of all the troops, accompanied by a thousand and five hundred<br>infuriated elephants and awful size clad in mail and of fierce deeds, and<br>all ridden by well-trained elephant-riders. Thy two other sons, viz.,<br>Duhsasana and Vikarna, took up their position amid the advance-divisions<br>of the army, for the accomplishment of the objects of Jayadratha. The<br>array that Bharadwaja's son formed, part Sakata and part a circle, was<br>full forty-eight miles long and the width of its rear measured twenty<br>miles. Drona himself formed that array with countless brave kings,<br>stationed with it, and countless cars and steeds and elephants and<br>foot-soldiers. In the rear of that array was another impenetrable array<br>of the form of lotus. And within that lotus was another dense array<br>called the needle. Having formed his mighty array thus, Drona took up his<br>station. At the mouth of that needle, the great bowman Kritavarman took<br>up his stand. Next to Kritavarman, O sire, stood the ruler of the<br>Kamvojas and Jalasandha. Next to these, stood Duryodhana and Karna.<br>Behind them hundreds and thousands of unreturning heroes were stationed<br>in that Sakata for protecting its head. Behind them all, O monarch, and<br>surrounded by a vast force, was king Jayadratha stationed at one side of<br>that needle-shaped array. At the entrance of the Sakata, O king, was<br>Bharadwaja's son. Behind Drona was the chief of the Bhojas, who protected<br>him. Clad in white armour, with excellent head-gear, of broad chest and<br>mighty arms, Drona stood, stretching his large bow, like the Destroyer<br>himself in wrath. Beholding Drona's car which was graced with a beautiful<br>standard and had red sacrificial altar and a black deer-skin, the<br>Kauravas were filled with delight. Seeing that array formed by Drona,<br>which resembled the ocean itself in agitation, the Siddhas and the<br>Charanas were filled with wonder. And all creatures thought that array<br>would devour the whole earth with her mountains and seas and forests, and<br>abounding with diverse things. And king Duryodhana, beholding that mighty<br>array in the form of a Sakata, teeming with carts and men and steeds and<br>elephants, roaring dreadful of wonderful form, and capable of riving the<br>hearts of foes, began to rejoice.'"
