                            (Jayadratha-Vadha Parva)<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'After Abhimanyu's slaughter when the next day came,<br>what did the Pandavas, afflicted with grief and sorrow do? Who amongst my<br>warriors fought with them? Knowing, as they did, the achievements of<br>Savyasachin, O tell me, how the Kauravas, could, having perpetrated such<br>a wrong, remain fearlessly. How could they in battle venture even to gaze<br>at that tiger among men (viz., Arjuna), as he advanced like the<br>all-destroying Death himself in fury, burning with grief on account of<br>the slaughter of his son? Beholding that warrior having the prince of<br>apes on his banner, that hero grieved on account of his son's death<br>shaking his gigantic bow in battle, what did my warrior do? What, O<br>Sanjaya, hath befallen unto Duryodhana? A great sorrow hath overtaken us<br>today. I do not any longer hear the sounds of joy. Those charming sounds,<br>highly agreeable to the ear, that were formerly heard in the abode of the<br>Sindhu king, alas those sounds are no longer heard today. Alas, in the<br>camp of my sons, the sounds of countless bards and panegyrists singing<br>their praises, and of dances are no longer heard. Formerly, such sounds<br>used to strike my ears incessantly. Alas, as they are plunged into grief<br>I do not any longer hear those sounds uttered (in their camp). Formerly,<br>O Sanjaya, while sitting in the abode of Somadatta who was devoted to<br>truth, I used to hear such delightful sounds. Alas, how destitute of<br>(religious) merit I am, for I observe the abode of my sons today to be<br>echoing with sounds of grief and lamentations and destitute of every<br>noise betokening life and energy. In the houses of Vivinsati, Durmukha,<br>Chitrasena, Vikarna, and other sons of mine, I do not hear the sounds I<br>used to hear formerly. That great bowman, viz., the son of Drona, who was<br>the refuge of my sons, upon him Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas, and<br>a large number of disciples used to wait, who took pleasure day and night<br>in controversial disputations, in talk, in conversation, in the stirring<br>music of diverse instruments, and in various kinds of delightful songs,<br>who was worshipped by many persons among the Kurus, the Pandavas, and the<br>Satwatas, alas, O Suta, in the abode of that son of Drona no sound can be<br>heard as formerly. Singers and dancers used, in a large number, to wait<br>closely upon that mighty bowman, viz., the son of Drona. Alas, their<br>sounds can no longer be heard in his abode. That loud noise which rose in<br>the camp of Vinda and Anuvinda every evening, alas, that noise is no<br>longer heard there. Not in the camp of the Kaikeyas can that loud sound<br>of song and slapping of palms be heard today which their soldiers,<br>engaged in dance and revelry, used to make. Those priests competent in<br>the performance of sacrifices who used to wait upon Somadatta's son, that<br>refuge of scriptural rites, alas, their sounds can no longer be heard.<br>The twang of the bowstring, the sounds of Vedic recitation, the whiz of<br>lances and swords, and rattle of car-wheels, used incessantly to be heard<br>in the abode of Drona. Alas, those sounds can no longer be heard there.<br>That swell of songs of diverse realms, that loud noise of musical<br>instruments, which used to arise there, alas, those can no longer be<br>heard today. When Janardana of unfading glory came from Upaplavya,<br>desirous of peace, from compassion for every creature, I then, O Suta,<br>said unto the wicked Duryodhana: Obtaining Vasudeva as the means, make<br>peace with the Pandavas, O son! I think the time has come (for making<br>peace). Do not, O Duryodhana, transgress my command. If thou settest<br>Vasudeva aside, who now begs thee for peace and addresses thee for my<br>good, victory thou wilt never have in battle. Duryodhana, however, did<br>set aside him of Dasarha's race, that bull among all bowmen, who then<br>spoke what was for Duryodhana's good. By this, he embraced what was<br>calamitous to himself. Seized by Death himself, that wicked-souled son of<br>mine, rejecting my counsels, adopted those of Duhsasana and Karna. I<br>myself did not approve of the game of dice. Vidura did not approve of it.<br>The ruler of the Sindhus did not, nor Bhishma; nor Salya; nor<br>Bhurisravas; nor Purumitra; nor Jaya; nor Aswatthaman; nor Kripa; nor<br>Drona, O Sanjaya! If my son had conducted himself according to the<br>counsels of these persons, he would then, with his kinsmen and friends<br>have lived for ever in happiness and peace. Of sweet and delightful<br>speech ever saying what is agreeable amid their kinsmen, high-born, loved<br>by all, and possessed of wisdom, the sons of Pandu are sure to obtain<br>happiness. The man who casteth his eye on righteousness, always and<br>everywhere obtaineth happiness. Such a man after death, winneth benefit<br>and grace. Possessed of sufficient might, the Pandavas deserve to enjoy<br>half the earth. The earth girt by the seas is as much their ancestral<br>possession (as of the Kurus). Possessed of sovereignty, the Pandavas will<br>never deviate from the track of righteousness. O child, I have kinsmen to<br>whose voice the Pandavas will ever listen, such, for instance, as Salya,<br>Somadatta, the high-souled Bhishma, Drona, Vikarna, Valhika, Kripa, and<br>others among the Bharatas that are illustrious and reverend in years. If<br>they speak unto them on thy behalf the Pandavas will certainly act<br>according to those beneficial recommendations. Or, who amongst these,<br>thinkest thou, belongs to their party that will speak to them otherwise?<br>Krishna will never abandon the path of righteousness. The Pandavas are<br>all obedient to him. Words of righteousness spoken by myself also, those<br>heroes will never disobey, for the Pandavas are all of righteous soul.'<br>Piteously lamenting, O Suta, I spoke these and many such words unto my<br>son. Foolish as he is, he listened not to me! I think all this to be the<br>mischievous influence of Time! There where Vrikodara and Arjuna are, and<br>the Vrishni hero, Satyaki, and Uttamaujas of the Panchalas, and the<br>invincible Yudhamanyu, and the irrepressible Dhrishtadyumna, and the<br>unvanquished Sikhandin, the Asmakas, the Kekayas, and Kshatradharman of<br>'the Somakas, the ruler of the Chedis, and Chekitana, and Vibhu, the son<br>of the ruler of the Kasi, the sons of Draupadi, and Virata and the mighty<br>car-warrior Drupada, and those tigers among men viz., the twins (Nakula<br>and Sahadeva), and the stayer of Madhu to offer counsel, who is there in<br>this world that would fight these, expecting to live? Who else, again, is<br>there, save Duryodhana, and Karna, and Sakuni, the son of Suvala, and<br>Duhsasana as their fourth, for I do not see the fifth that would venture<br>to resist my foes while the latter display their celestial weapons? They<br>who have Vishnu himself on their car, clad in mail and reins in hand,<br>they who have Arjuna for their warrior, they can never have defeat! Doth<br>not Duryodhana now recollect those lamentations of mine? The tiger among<br>men, Bhishma, thou hast said, has been slain. I think, beholding the<br>fruits of the words uttered by the far-seeing Vidura, my sons are now<br>indulging in lamentations! I think, beholding his army overwhelmed by<br>Sini's grandson and Arjuna, beholding the terraces of his cars empty, my<br>sons are indulging in lamentations. As a swelling conflagration urged by<br>the winds consumes a heap of dry grass at the close of winter, even so<br>will Dhananjaya consume my troops. O Sanjaya, thou art accomplished in<br>narration. Tell me everything that transpired after the doing of that<br>great wrong to Partha in the evening. When Abhimanyu was slain, what<br>became the state of your minds? Having, O son, greatly offended the<br>wielder of Gandiva, my warriors are incapable of bearing in battle his<br>achievements. What measures were resolved upon by Duryodhana and what by<br>Karna? What also did Duhsasana and Suvala's son do? O Sanjaya, O son,<br>that which has in battle befallen all my children assembled together, is<br>certainly due to the evil acts of the wicked Duryodhana, who followeth in<br>the path of avarice, who is of wicked understanding, whose judgment is<br>perverted by wrath, who coveteth sovereignty, who is foolish, and who is<br>deprived of reason by anger. Tell me, O Sanjaya, what measures were then<br>adopted by Duryodhana? Were they ill-judged or well-judged?'"
