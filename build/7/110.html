                            "Sanjaya said, 'That bull amongst the Sinis, viz., Satyaki, hearing these<br>words o, full affection, agreeable, fraught with sweet sounds, opportune,<br>delightful, and equitable that were uttered by king Yudhishthira the<br>just, replied unto him, O chief of the Bharatas, saying, 'O thou of<br>unfading glory, I have heard all the words thou hast said, words fraught<br>with justice, delightful, and conducive to fame for the sake of Phalguna.<br>At such a time, indeed, beholding one devoted (to thee) like me, it<br>behoveth thee, O king of kings, to command him as much, as thou canst<br>command Partha himself. As regards myself, I am prepared to cast away my<br>life for the sake of Dhananjaya. Commanded, again, by thee, what is there<br>I would not do in great battle? What need I say of this weak<br>(Dhritarashtra) force? Urged by thee, I am prepared, O best of men, to<br>battle with three worlds including the gods, the Asuras, and men. Today I<br>will fight with the entire army of Suyodhana and vanquish it in battle.<br>Truly do I say this unto thee, O king! Safely shall I reach Dhananjaya<br>himself in safety, and after Jayadratha is slain, I shall, O king, come<br>back into thy presence. I must, however, O king, inform thee of the words<br>of Vasudeva as also those of the intelligent Arjuna. I was strongly and<br>repeatedly solicited by Arjuna in the midst of all our warriors and in<br>the hearing also of Vasudeva (in these words), Today, O Madhava, nobly<br>resolved in battle, protect thou the king carefully, till I slay<br>Jayadratha! Making over the monarch to thee, O mighty-armed one, or to<br>that great car-warrior Pradyumna, I can go with an easy heart towards<br>Jayadratha. Thou knowest Drona in battle, that warrior who is regarded as<br>the foremost one among the Kurus. Thou knowest also the vow made by him<br>in the presence of all, O lord! The son of Bharadwaja is always eager to<br>seize the king. He is competent also in afflicting king Yudhishthira in<br>battle. Charging thee with the protection of that best of men, viz., king<br>Yudhishthira the just, I will proceed today for the destruction of the<br>ruler of the Sindhus. Slaying Jayadratha, I shall soon come back, O<br>Madhava! See that Drona may not succeed in forcibly seizing king<br>Yudhishthira the just in battle. If Yudhishthira be seized by<br>Bharadwaja's son, O Madhava, I shall not succeed in slaying Jayadratha,<br>and great will be my grief. If that best of men, the truthful son of<br>Pandu, be seized, it is evident that we shall have again to go into<br>woods. My success, therefore, over Jayadratha, it is plain, will be<br>productive of no benefit, if Drona, inflamed with rage, succeeds in<br>seizing Yudhishthira in battle. O mighty-armed one, for doing what is<br>agreeable to me, therefore, O Madhava, as also for the sake of my success<br>and fame, protect the king in battle.' Thou seest, therefore, O king,<br>thou hast been made over to me as a trust by Savyasachin, O lord, in<br>consequence of his constant fear of Bharadwaja's son. O mighty-armed one,<br>I myself daily see, O lord, that there is none, save Rukmini's son<br>(Pradyumna), who can be a match for Drona in battle. I also am regarded<br>to be a match for the intelligent son of Bharadwaja in battle. It is<br>plain, therefore, I cannot dare falsify that reputation which I have, or<br>disregard the commands of my preceptor (Arjuna), or leave thee, O king!<br>The preceptor (Drona), cased as he is in impenetrable mail, in<br>consequence of his lightness of arms, obtaining thee in battle, will<br>sport with thee as a child with a little bird. If Krishna's son, bearing<br>the Makara on his banner, were here, I could then have made over to him,<br>for he would have protected thee as Arjuna himself. Thou shouldst protect<br>thyself. When I am gone, who will protect thee, who that is, that will<br>advance against Drona while I proceed towards Arjuna? O king, let no fear<br>be thine today on Arjuna's account. He never becomes cheerless under any<br>burden howsoever heavy. Those warriors that are opposed to him, viz., the<br>Sauvirakas, the Sindhava-Pauravas, they from the north, they from the<br>south, and they, O king, headed by Karna, that are regarded as foremost<br>of car-warriors, do not together come up to a sixteenth part of Arjuna.<br>The whole earth rising against him, with the gods, the Asuras, and men,<br>with all the tribes of Rakshasas, O king, with the Kinnaras, the great<br>snakes, and in fact, all the mobile and the immobile creatures assembled<br>together, is no match for Arjuna in battle. Knowing this, O king, let thy<br>fear on Dhananjaya's account be dispelled. There where those two heroes<br>and great bowmen, viz., the two Krishnas, of prowess incapable of being<br>baffled, are, there the slightest obstacle cannot happen to their<br>purpose. Think of the celestial puissance, the accomplishment in weapons,<br>the resourcefulness, the wrath in battle, the gratefulness, and the<br>compassion of thy brother. Think also, O king, of the wonderful knowledge<br>of weapons that Drona will display in battle when I leave this place for<br>going to Arjuna. The preceptor, O monarch, is eagerly solicitous of<br>seizing thee. He is eagerly desirous also, O king, of making good his<br>vow, O Bharata! Be attentive, O king, to thy own protection. Who will<br>protect thee when I am gone, who is he that is, confiding on whom I may<br>go towards Pritha's son, Phalguna? I tell thee truly, O great king, that<br>without making thee over to somebody in this great battle, I will not<br>surely go towards Arjuna, O thou of Kuru's race! Reflecting on this, from<br>every point of view, with the aid of thy intelligence, O foremost of all<br>intelligent persons, and ascertaining with thy intelligence what is for<br>thy highest good, command me, O king!'<br><br>"Yudhishthira hearing these words said, 'It is even so, O mighty-armed<br>one, as thou sayest, O Madhava! For all that, however, O sire, my heart<br>doth not become easy on Arjuna's account. I shall take the greatest<br>precaution in protecting myself. Commanded by me, go thou thither where<br>Dhananjaya hath gone. Weighing, with my judgment, my own protection in<br>battle with the necessity of your going towards Arjuna, the latter seems<br>to me preferable, Make thyself ready, therefore, to go thither whither<br>Dhananjaya hath gone. The mighty Bhima will protect me. Prishata's son,<br>with all his uterine brothers, and all the mighty kings, and the sons of<br>Draupadi, will without doubt, protect me. The five Kekaya brothers, and<br>the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha, and Virata, and Drupada, and the mighty<br>car-warrior Sikhandin and Dhrishtaketu of great strength, and Kuntibhoja,<br>O sire, Nakula, and Sahadeva, and the Panchalas, and the Srinjayas,&#8212;all<br>these, O sire, will without doubt, very carefully protect me. Drona at<br>the head of his troops, and Kritavarman also, in battle, will not succeed<br>in beating us or afflicting me. That scorcher of foes, viz.,<br>Dhrishtadyumna, displaying his prowess, will resist the angry Drona, like<br>the continent resisting the sea. There where Prishata's son, that slayer<br>of hostile heroes, will remain, there Drona will never be able to<br>forcibly transgress our troops. This Dhristadyumna sprang from the fire,<br>for the destruction of Drona, clad in mail, armed with bow and arrows and<br>sword, and decked with costly ornaments. Go, O grandson of Sini, with an<br>easy heart, do not be anxious on my account. Dhrishtadyumna will resist<br>angry Drona in battle.'"
