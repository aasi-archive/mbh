                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then lord Kesava, of eyes like lotus-petals, having<br>entered the unrivalled mansion of Arjuna, touched water, and spread (for<br>Arjuna) on the auspicious and even floor an excellent bed of Kusa blades<br>that were of the hue of the lapis lazuli. And keeping excellent weapons<br>around that bed, he adorned it duly with garlands of flowers and fried<br>paddy, perfumes and other auspicious articles. And after Partha (also)<br>had touched water, meek and submissive attendants brought the usual<br>nightly sacrifice to the Three-eyed (Mahadeva). Then Partha, with a<br>cheerful soul, having smeared Madhava with perfumes and adorned with<br>floral garlands, presented unto Mahadeva the nightly offering.[131] Then<br>Govinda, with a faint smile, addressed Partha, saying, 'Blessed be thou,<br>O Partha, lay thyself down, I leave thee.' Placing door-keepers then, and<br>also sentinels well-armed, blessed Kesava, followed by (his charioteer)<br>Daruka, repaired to his own tent. He then laid himself down on his white<br>bed, and thought of diverse measures to be adopted. And the illustrious<br>one (Kesava) of eyes like lotus petals, began for Partha's sake, to think<br>of various means that would dispel (Partha's) grief and anxiety and<br>enhance his prowess and splendour. Of soul wrapt in yoga, that Supreme<br>Lord of all, viz., Vishnu of wide-spread fame, who always did what was<br>agreeable to Jishnu, desirous of benefiting (Arjuna), lapsed into yoga,<br>and meditation. There was none in the Pandava camp who slept that night.<br>Wakefulness possessed every one, O monarch. And everybody (in the Pandava<br>camp) thought of this, viz.,&#8212;The high-souled wielder of Gandiva, burning<br>with grief for the death of his son, hath suddenly vowed the slaughter of<br>the Sindhus. How, indeed, will that slayer of hostile heroes, that son of<br>Vasava, that mighty-armed warrior, accomplish his vow? The high-souled<br>son of Pandu hath, indeed made a most difficult resolve. King Jayadratha<br>is endued with mighty energy. Oh, let Arjuna succeed in fulfilling his<br>vow. Difficult is that vow which he, afflicted with grief on account of<br>his son, hath made. Duryodhana's brothers are all possessed of great<br>prowess. His forces also are countless. The son of Dhritarashtra hath<br>assigned all these to Jayadratha (as his protectors). Oh, let Dhananjaya<br>come back (to the camp), having slain the ruler of the Sindhus in battle.<br>Vanquishing his foes, let Arjuna accomplish his vow. If he fails to slay<br>the ruler of the Sindhus tomorrow, he will certainly enter into blazing<br>fire. Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, will not falsify his oath. If Arjuna<br>dies, how will the son of Dharma succeed in recovering his kingdom?<br>Indeed, (Yudhishthira) the son of Pandu hath reposed (all his hopes of)<br>victory of Arjuna. If we have achieved any (religious) merit, if we have<br>ever poured libations of clarified butter into fire, let Savyasachin,<br>aided by the fruits thereof, vanquish all his foes.' Thus talking, O<br>lord, with one another about the victory (of the morrow), that long<br>night, O king, of theirs, at last, passed away. In the middle of the<br>night, Janardana, having awaked, remembered Partha's vow, and addressing<br>(his charioteer) Daruka, said, 'Arjuna, in grief for the death of his<br>son, hath vowed. O Daruka, that before tomorrow's sun goes down he will<br>slay Jayadratha. Hearing of this, Duryodhana will assuredly take counsel<br>with his counsellors, about how Partha may fail to achieve his object.<br>His several Akshauhinis of troops will protect Jayadratha. Fully<br>conversant with the ways of applying all weapons, Drona also, with his<br>son, will protect him. That matchless hero, the Thousand-eyed (Indra<br>himself), that crusher of the pride of Daityas and Danavas cannot venture<br>to slay him in battle who is protected by Drona. I, therefore, will do<br>that tomorrow by which Arjuna, the son of Kunti, may slay Jayadratha<br>before the sun sets. My wives, my kinsmen, my relatives, non amongst<br>these is dearer to me than Arjuna. O Daruka, I shall not be able to cast<br>my eyes, even for a single moment, on the earth bereft of Arjuna. I tell<br>thee, the earth shall not be reft to Arjuna. Myself vanquishing them all<br>with their steeds and elephants by putting forth my strength for the sake<br>of Arjuna, I will slay them with Karna and Suyodhana. Let the three<br>worlds tomorrow behold my prowess in great battle, when I put forth my<br>valour, O Daruka, for Dhananjaya's sake. Tomorrow thousands of kings and<br>hundreds of princes, with their steeds and cars and elephants, will, O<br>Daruka, fly away from battle. Thou shalt tomorrow, O Daruka, behold that<br>army of kings overthrown and crushed with my discus, by myself in wrath<br>for the sake of the son of Pandu. Tomorrow the (three) worlds with the<br>gods, the Gandharvas, the Pisachas, the Snakes, and the Rakshasas, will<br>know me as a (true) friend of Savyasachin. He that hateth him, hateth me.<br>He that followeth him, followeth me. Thou hast intelligence. Know that<br>Arjuna is half of myself. When morning comes after the expiry of this<br>night, thou, O Daruka, equipping my excellent car according to the rules<br>of military science, must bring it and follow me with it carefully,<br>placing on it my celestial mace called Kaumodaki, my dart and discus, bow<br>and arrows, and every other thing necessary. O Suta, making room on the<br>terrace of my car for my standard and for the heroic Garuda thereon, that<br>adorns my umbrella, and yoking thereto my foremost of steeds named<br>Valahaka and Meghapushpa and Saivya and Sugriva, having cased them in<br>golden mail of the splendour of the sun and fire, and thyself putting on<br>thy armour, stay on it carefully. Upon hearing the loud and terrible<br>blast of my conch Panchajanya emitting the shrill Rishava note,[132] thou<br>wilt come quickly to me. In course of a single day, O Daruka, I shall<br>dispel the wrath and the diverse woes of my cousin, the son of my<br>paternal aunt. By every means shall I strive so that Vibhatsu in battle<br>may slay Jayadratha in the very sight of the Dhartarashtras. O<br>charioteer, I tell thee that Vibhatsu will certainly succeed in slaying<br>all these for whose slaughter he will strive.'<br><br>"Daruka said, 'He is certain to have victory whose charioteership, O<br>tiger among men, hath been taken by thee. Whence, indeed, can defeat come<br>to him? As regards myself, I will do that which thou hast commanded me to<br>do. This night will bring (on its train) the auspicious morn for Arjuna's<br>victory.'"
