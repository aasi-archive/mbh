                            "Narada said, 'Vena's son, king Prithu, O Srinjaya, we hear, fell a prey<br>to death, In the Rajasuya sacrifice he performed, the great Rishis<br>installed him as Emperor (of the world). He vanquished all, and his<br>achievements, became known (all over the world). For this he came to be<br>called Prithu (the celebrated). And because he protected all people from<br>wounds and injuries, for this he became a true Kshatriya.[115] Beholding<br>Vena's son, Prithu, all his subjects said, We are highly pleased with<br>him. In consequence of this affection that he enjoyed of his subjects he<br>came to be called a Raja.[116] During the time of Prithu, the earth,<br>without being cultivated, yielded crops in sufficiency. All the kine,<br>again, yielded milk whenever they were touched. Every lotus was full of<br>honey. The Kusa blades were all of gold, agreeable to the touch, and<br>otherwise delightful. And the subjects of Prithu made clothes of these<br>blades and the beds also on which they lay. All the fruits were soft and<br>sweet and like unto Amrita (in taste). And these constituted the food of<br>his subjects, none amongst whom had ever to starve. And all men in<br>Prithu's time were hale and hearty. And all their wishes were crowned<br>with fruition. They had nothing to fear. On trees, or in caves, they<br>dwelt as they liked. His dominions were not distributed into provinces<br>and towns. The people lived happily and in joy as each desired. When king<br>Prithu went to the sea, the waves became solid. The very mountains used<br>to yield him openings that he might pass through them. The standard of<br>his car never broke (obstructed by anything). Once on a time, the tall<br>trees of the forest, the mountains, the gods, the Asuras, men, the<br>snakes, the seven Rishis, the Apsaras, and the Pitris, all came to<br>Prithu, seated at his ease, and addressing him, said, 'Thou art our<br>Emperor. Thou art our king. Thou art our protector and Father. Thou art<br>our Lord. Therefore, O great king, give us boons after our own hearts,<br>through which we may, for ever, obtain gratification and joy.' Unto them<br>Prithu, the son of Vena, said, So be it. Then taking up his Ajagava<br>bow[117] and some terrible arrows the like of which existed not, he<br>reflected for a moment. He then addressed the Earth, saying, 'Coming<br>quickly, O Earth! Yield to these the milk they desire. From that, blessed<br>be thou, I will give them the food they solicit.' Thus addressed by him,<br>the Earth said, 'It behoveth thee, O hero, to regard me as thy daughter.'<br>Prithu answered, So be it!&#8212;And then that great ascetic, his passions<br>under control, made all arrangements (for milking the Earth. Then the<br>entire assemblage of creatures began to milk the Earth). And first of<br>all, the tall trees of the forest rose for milking her, The Earth then,<br>full of affection, stood there desiring a calf, a milker, and vessels<br>(wherein to hold the milk). Then the blossoming Sala became the calf, the<br>Banian became the milker, torn buds became the milk, and the auspicious<br>fig tree became the vessel. (Next, the mountains milked her). The Eastern<br>hill, whereon the Sun rises, became the calf; the prince of mountains,<br>viz., Meru, became the milker; the diverse gems and deciduous herbs<br>became the milk; and the stones became the vessels (for holding that<br>milk). Next, one of the gods became the milker, and all things capable of<br>bestowing energy and strength became the coveted milk. The Asuras then<br>milked the Earth, having wine for their milk, and using an unbaked pot<br>for their vessel. In that act, Dwimurddhan became the milker, and<br>Virochana, the calf. The human beings milked the Earth for cultivation<br>and crops. The self-created Manu became their calf, and Prithu himself<br>the milker. Next, the Snakes milked the Earth, getting poison as the<br>milk, and using a vessel made of a gourd, Dhritarashtra became the<br>milker, and Takshaka the calf. The seven Rishis, capable of producing<br>everything by their fiat,[118] then milked the Earth, getting the Vedas<br>as their milk. Vrihaspati became the milker, the Chhandas were the<br>vessel, and the excellent Soma, the calf. The Yakshas, milking the Earth,<br>got the power of disappearance at will as the milk in an unbaked pot.<br>Vaisravana (Kuvera) became their milker, and Vrishadhvaja their calf. The<br>Gandharvas and the Apsaras milked all fragrant perfumes in a vessel made<br>of a lotus-leaf. Chitraratha became their calf, and the puissant<br>Viswaruchi their milker. The Pitris milked the Earth, getting Swaha as<br>their milk in a vessel of silver. Yama, the son of Vivaswat, became their<br>calf, and (the Destroyer Antaka) their milker. Even thus was the Earth<br>milked by that assemblage of creatures who all got for milk what they<br>each desired. The very calves and vessels employed by them are existing<br>to this day and may always be seen. The powerful Prithu, the son of Vena,<br>performing various sacrifices, gratified all creatures in respect of all<br>their desires by gifts of articles agreeable to their hearts. And he<br>caused golden images to be made of every article on earth, and bestowed<br>them all on the Brahmanas as his great Horse-sacrifice,[119] The king<br>caused six and sixty thousand elephants to be made of gold, and all those<br>he gave away unto the Brahmanas. And this whole earth also the king<br>caused to be decked with jewels and gems and gold, and gave her away unto<br>the Brahmanas. When he died, O Srinjaya, who was superior to thee as<br>regards the four cardinal virtues and who, superior to thee, was,<br>therefore, much superior to thy son thou shouldst not, saying 'Oh,<br>Swaitya, Oh, Swaitya,' grieve for the latter who performed no sacrifice<br>and made no sacrificial present.'"
