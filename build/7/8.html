                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding Drona thus slaying steeds and drivers and<br>car-warriors and elephants, the Pandavas, without being troubled,<br>encompassed him on all sides. Then king Yudhishthira, addressing<br>Dhrishtadyumna and Dhananjaya, said unto them, 'Let the pot-born (Drona)<br>be checked, our men surrounding him on all sides with care.' Thus<br>addressed those mighty car-warriors, viz., Arjuna and Prishata's son,<br>along with their followers, all received Drona as the latter came. And<br>the Kekaya princes, and Bhimasena, and Subhadra's son and Ghatotkacha and<br>Yudhishthira, and the twins (Nakula and Sahadeva), and the ruler of the<br>Matsyas, and the son of Drupada, and the (five) sons of Draupadi, all<br>filled with joy, and Dhrishtaketu, and Satyaki, and the wrathful<br>Chitrasena, and the mighty car-warrior, Yuyutsu, and many other kings, O<br>monarch, who followed the sons of Pandu, all achieved diverse feats in<br>keeping with their lineage and prowess. Beholding then that host<br>protected in that battle by those Pandava warriors, Bharadwaja's son,<br>turning his eyes in wrath, cast his looks upon it. Inflamed with rage,<br>that warrior, invincible in battle, consumed, as he stood upon his car,<br>the Pandava host like the tempest destroying vast masses of clouds.<br>Rushing on all sides at car-warriors and steeds and foot-soldiers and<br>elephants, Drona furiously careered over the field like a young man,<br>though bearing the weight of years. His red steeds, fleet as the wind,<br>and of excellent breed, covered with blood, O king, assumed a beautiful<br>appearance. Beholding that hero of regulated vows, felling them like Yama<br>himself inflamed with wrath, the soldiers of Yudhishthira fled away on<br>all sides. And as some fled away and other rallied, as some looked at him<br>and others stayed on the field, the noise they made was fierce and<br>terrible. And that noise causing delight to heroes and enhancing the<br>fears of the timid, filled the whole sky and the earth. And once more<br>Drona, uttering his own name in battle, made himself exceedingly fierce,<br>scattering hundreds of arrows among the foes. Indeed, the mighty Drona,<br>though old, yet acting like a young man, careered like Death himself, O<br>sire, amid the divisions of Pandu's son. That fierce warrior cutting off<br>heads and arms decked with ornaments, made the terraces of many cars<br>empty and uttered leonine roars. And in consequence of those joyous<br>shouts of his, as also of the force of his shafts, the warriors, O lord,<br>(of the hostile army) trembled like a herd of cows afflicted by cold. And<br>in consequence of the rattle of his car and the stretching of his<br>bow-string and the twang of his bow, the whole welkin resounded with a<br>loud noise. And the shaft., of that hero, coursing in thousands from his<br>bow, and enveloping all the points of the compass, fell upon the<br>elephants and steeds and cars and foot-soldiers (of the enemy). Then the<br>Panchalas and the Pandavas boldly approached Drona, who, armed with his<br>bow of great force, resembled a fire having weapons for its flames. Then<br>with their elephants and foot-soldiers and steeds he began to despatch<br>them unto the abode of Yama. And Drona made the earth miry with blood.<br>Scattering his mighty weapons and shooting his shafts thick on every<br>side, Drona soon so covered all the points of the compass, that nothing<br>could be seen except his showers of arrows. And among foot-soldiers and<br>cars and steeds and elephants nothing could be seen save Drona's arrows.<br>The standard of his car was all that could be seen, moving like flashes<br>of lightning amid the cars.[12] Of soul incapable of being depressed,<br>Drona then, armed with bow and arrows, afflicted the five princes of<br>Kekaya and the ruler of the Panchalas and then rushed against the<br>division of Yudhishthira. Then Bhimasena and Dhananjaya and the grandson<br>of Sini, and the sons of Drupada, and the ruler of Kasi, viz., the son of<br>Saivya, and Sivi himself, cheerfully and with loud roars covered him with<br>their arrows. Shafts in thousands, decked with wings of gold, shot from<br>Drona's bow, piercing through the bodies of the elephants and the young<br>horses of those warriors, entered the earth, their feathers dyed with<br>blood. The field of battle, strewn with cars and the prostrate forms of<br>large bands of warriors, and of elephants and steeds mangled with shafts,<br>looked like the welkin covered with masses of black clouds. Then Drona,<br>desirous of the prosperity of thy sons, having thus crushed the divisions<br>of Satyaki, and Bhima, and Dhananjaya and Subhadra's son and Drupada, and<br>the ruler of the Kasi, and having ground many other heroes in battle,<br>indeed, that high-souled warrior, having achieved these and many other<br>feats, and having, O chief of the Kurus, scorched the world like the Sun<br>himself as he rises at the end of the Yuga, proceeded hence, O monarch,<br>to heaven. That hero possessed of golden car, that grinder of hostile<br>hosts, having achieved mighty feats and slain in thousands the warriors<br>of the Pandava host in battle, hath at last been himself slain by<br>Dhrishtadyumna. Having, in fact, slain more than two Akshauhinis of brave<br>and unreturning warriors, that hero endued with intelligence, at last,<br>attained to the highest state. Indeed, O king, having achieved the most<br>difficult feats, he hath, at last, been slain by the Pandavas and the<br>Panchalas of cruel deeds. When the preceptor was slain in battle, there<br>arose in the welkin, O monarch, a loud uproar of all creatures, as also<br>of all the troops. Resounding through heaven and earth and the<br>intermediate space and through the cardinal and the subsidiary<br>directions, the loud cry 'O Fie!'&#8212;of creatures; was heard. And the gods,<br>the Pitris, and they that were his friends, all beheld that mighty<br>car-warrior, viz., the son of Bharadwaja, thus slain. The Pandavas,<br>having won the victory, uttered leonine shouts. And the earth trembled<br>with those loud shouts of theirs.'"
