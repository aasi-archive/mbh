                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Unvanquished by Drona, and Radha's son and Vikarna<br>and Kritavarman, how could the heroic Satyaki, never before checked in<br>battle, having after his promise to Yudhishthira crossed the ocean of the<br>Kaurava troops, being humiliated by the Kuru warrior Bhurisravas and<br>forcibly thrown on the ground?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Hear, O king, about the origin, in the past times, of<br>Sini's grandson, and of how Bhurisravas also came to be descended. This<br>will clear thy doubts. Atri had for son Soma. Soma's son was called<br>Vudha. Vudha had one son, of the splendour of the great Indra, called<br>Pururavas. Pururavas had a son called Ayus. Ayus had for his son Nahusha.<br>Nahusha had for his son Yayati who was a royal sage equal to a celestial.<br>Yayati had by Devayani Yadu for his eldest son. In Yadu's race was born a<br>son of the name of Devamidha of Yadu's race had a son named Sura,<br>applauded in the three worlds. Sura had for his son that foremost of men,<br>viz., the celebrated Vasudeva. Foremost in bowmanship, Sura was equal to<br>Kartavirya in battle. In Sura's race and equal unto Sura in energy was,<br>born Sini, O king! About this time, O king, occurred the Swayamvara. of<br>the high-souled Devaka's daughter, in which all the Kshatriyas were<br>present. In that self-choice, Sini vanquishing all the kings, quickly<br>took up on his car the princess Devaki for the sake of Vasudeva.<br>Beholding the princess Devaki on Sini's car, that bull among men, viz.,<br>the brave Somadatta of mighty energy could not brook the sight. A battle,<br>O king, ensued between the two which lasted for half a day and was<br>beautiful and wonderful to behold. The battle that took place between<br>those two mighty men was a wrestling encounter. That bull among men,<br>viz., Somadatta, was forcibly thrown down on the earth by Sini. Uplifting<br>his sword and seizing him by the hair, Sini struck his foe with his foot,<br>in the midst of many thousands of kings who stood as spectators all<br>around. At last, from compassion, he let him off, saying, 'Live!' Reduced<br>to that plight by Sini, Somadatta, O sire, under the influence of wrath<br>began to pay his adorations to Mahadeva for inducing the latter to bless<br>him. That great lord of all boon-giving deities viz., Mahadeva, became<br>gratified with him and asked him to solicit the boon he desired. The<br>royal Somadatta then solicited the following boon, 'I desire a soon, O<br>divine lord, who will strike Sini's son in the midst of thousands of<br>kings and who will in battle strike him with his foot.' Hearing these<br>words, O king, of Somadatta, the god saying, 'So be it,' disappeared then<br>and there. It was in consequence of the gift of that boon that Somadatta<br>subsequently obtained the highly charitable Bhurisravas for son, and it<br>was for this, Somadatta's son threw down Sini's descendant in battle and<br>struck him, before the eyes of the whole army, with his foot. I have now<br>told thee, O king, what thou hadst asked me. Indeed, the Satwata hero is<br>incapable of being vanquished in battle by even the foremost of men. The<br>Vrishni heroes are all of sure aim in battle, and are conversant with all<br>modes of warfare. They are vanquishers of the very gods, the Danavas and<br>the Gandharvas. They are never confounded. They always fight, relying<br>upon their own energy. They are never dependent on others. None, O lord,<br>are seen in this world to be equal to the Vrishni's. None, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, have been, are, or will be equal in might to the<br>Vrishni's. They never show disrespect to their kinsmen. They are always<br>obedient to the commands of those that are reverend in years. The very<br>gods and Asuras and Gandharvas, the Yakshas, the Uragas and the Rakshasas<br>cannot vanquish the Vrishni heroes, what need be said of men, therefore,<br>in battle? They never covet also the possessions of those that ever<br>render them aid on any occasion of distress. Devoted to the Brahmanas and<br>truthful in speech, they never display any pride although they are<br>wealthy. The Vrishnis regard even the strong as weak and rescue them from<br>distress. Always devoted to the gods, the Vrishnis are self-restrained,<br>charitable, and free from pride. It is for this that the prowess,[173] of<br>the Vrishnis is never baffled. A person may remove the mountains of Meru<br>or swim across the ocean but cannot defeat the Vrishnis. I have told thee<br>everything about which thou hadst thy doubts. All this, however, O king<br>of the Kurus, that is happening is due to thy evil policy, O best of<br>men!'"
