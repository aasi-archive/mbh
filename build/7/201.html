                            "Sanjaya said, "Beholding Bhimasena overwhelmed by that weapon,<br>Dhananjaya, for baffling its energy, covered him with the Varuna weapon.<br>In consequence of the lightness of Arjuna's arms, and owing also to the<br>fiery force that shrouded Bhima, none could see that the latter had been<br>covered with the Varuna weapon. Shrouded with the weapon of Drona's son,<br>Bhima, his steeds, driver, and car became incapable of being gazed at,<br>like a fire of blazing flame in the midst of another fire. As at the<br>close of the night, O king, all the luminaries run towards the Asta hill,<br>even so the fiery shafts (of Aswatthaman) all began to proceed towards<br>Bhimasena's car. Indeed, Bhima himself, his car, steeds, and driver, O<br>sire, thus shrouded by Drona's son seemed to be in the midst of a<br>conflagration. As the (Yuga) fire consuming the entire universe with its<br>mobile and immobile creatures when the hour of dissolution comes, at last<br>enters the mouth of the Creator, even so at the weapon of Drona's son<br>began to enter the body of Bhimasena. As one cannot perceive a fire if it<br>penetrates into the sun or the sun if it enters into a fire, even so none<br>could perceive that energy which penetrated into Bhima's body. Beholding<br>that weapon thus investing Bhima all around, and seeing Drona's son<br>swelling with energy and might, the latter being then without an<br>antagonist, and observing also that all the warriors of the Pandava army<br>had laid down their weapons and that all the mighty car-warriors of that<br>host headed by Yudhishthira had turned away their faces from the foe,<br>those two heroes, viz., Arjuna and Vasudeva, both endued with great<br>splendour, quickly alighting from their car, ran towards Bhima. Those two<br>mighty men, diving into that energy born of the might of Aswatthaman's<br>weapon, had resorted to the power of illusion. The fire of that weapon<br>consumed them not, in consequence of their having laid aside their<br>weapons, as also in consequence of the force of the Varuna weapon, and<br>owing also to the energy possessed by themselves. Then Nara and Narayana,<br>for the pacification of Narayana weapon, began forcibly to drag Bhima and<br>all his weapons. Thus dragged by them, Kunti's son, that mighty<br>car-warrior, began to roar aloud. Thereupon, that terrible and invincible<br>weapon of Drona's son began to increase (in might and energy). Then<br>Vasudeva, addressing Bhima, said, 'How is it, O son of Pandu, that though<br>forbidden by us, thou, O son of Kunti, dost not yet abstain from battle?<br>If the Kurus could now be vanquished in battle, then we, as also all<br>these foremost of men, would certainly have continued to fight. Behold,<br>all the warriors of thy host have alighted from their cars. For this<br>reason, O son of Kunti, do thou also come down from thy car.' Having said<br>these words, Krishna brought Bhima down from his car. The latter, with<br>eyes red as blood in rage, was sighing like a snake. When, however, he<br>was dragged down from his car and made to lay aside his weapons, the<br>Narayana weapon, that scorcher of foes, became pacified.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'When, by this means, the unbearable energy of that<br>weapon became stilled, all the points of the compass, cardinal and<br>subsidiary, became clear. Sweet breezes began to blow and birds and<br>animals all became quiet. The steeds and elephants became cheerful, as<br>also all the warriors, O ruler of men! Indeed, when the terrible energy<br>of that weapon, O Bharata, became stilled, Bhima. of great intelligence,<br>shone resplendent like the morning sun. The remnant of the Pandava host,<br>beholding the pacification of the Narayana weapon, once more stood<br>prepared on the field for compassing the destruction of thy sons. When,<br>after that weapon had been baffled, the Pandava host, stood arrayed,<br>Duryodhana, O king, addressing Drona's son, said, O Aswatthaman, once<br>more use that weapon speedily since the Panchalas are once more arrayed,<br>desirous of victory.' Then addressed by thy son, O sire, Aswatthaman,<br>sighing cheerlessly, replied unto the king in these words, 'That weapon,<br>O king, cannot be brought back. It cannot be used twice. If brought back,<br>it will without doubt, slay the person calling it back. Vasudeva, hath,<br>by what means thou hast seen, caused it to be baffled. For this, O ruler<br>men, the destruction of the foe hath not been compassed in battle. Defeat<br>and death, however, are the same. Rather, defeat is worse than death. Lo,<br>the enemy, vanquished and compelled to lay down his arms, looks as if<br>deprived of life'. Duryodhana then said, 'O preceptor's son, if it be so,<br>if this weapon cannot be used twice, let those slayers of their preceptor<br>be slain with other weapons then, O foremost one of all persons<br>acquainted with weapons! In thee are all celestial as well as in the<br>Three eyed (Siva) of immeasurable energy. If thou wishest it not, even<br>Purandara in rage cannot escape thee.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'After Drona had been slain with the aid of fraud,<br>and the Narayana weapon baffled, what, indeed, did Drona's son, thus<br>urged by Duryodhana then, do, beholding the Parthas once more arrived for<br>battle freed from the Narayana weapon, and careering at the head of their<br>divisions?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Remembering the slaughter of his sire, Drona's son,<br>owning the device of the lion's tail on his banner, filled with rage and<br>casting of all fears, rushed against the son of Prishata. Rushing at him,<br>O bull among men, that foremost of warriors, with great impetuosity,<br>pierced the Panchala prince with five and twenty small arrows. Then<br>Dhrishtadyumna, O King, pierced Drona's son that resembled a blazing<br>fire, with four and sixty shafts. And he pierced Aswatthaman's driver<br>also with twenty arrows whetted on stone and equipped with wings of gold,<br>and then his four steeds with four sharp arrows. Repeatedly piercing<br>Drona's son, and causing the earth to tremble with his leonine roars.<br>Dhrishtadyumna then seemed to be employed in taking the lives of<br>creatures in the world in dreadful battle. Making death itself his goal,<br>the mighty son of Prishata, O king, accomplished in weapons and endued<br>with sureness of aim, then rushed against Drona's son alone. Of<br>immeasurable soul, that foremost of car-warriors, viz., the prince of<br>Panchala, poured upon Aswatthaman's head a shower of arrows. Then Drona's<br>son, in that battle, covered the angry prince with winged shafts. And<br>once more, he pierced the latter with ten shafts, remembering the<br>slaughter of his father. Then cutting off the standard and bow of the<br>Panchala prince with a couple of well-shot shafts, equipped with heads<br>like razors. Drona's son began to grind his foe with other arrows. In<br>that dreadful battle, Aswatthaman made his antagonist steedless and<br>driverless and carless, and covered his followers also with thick showers<br>of shafts. At this, the Panchala troops, O king, mangled by means of<br>those arrowy showers fled away in fear and great affliction. Beholding<br>the troops turning away from battle and Dhrishtadyumna exceedingly<br>afflicted, the grandson of Sini quickly urged his car against that of<br>Drona's son. He then afflicted Aswatthaman with eight keen shafts. And<br>once more striking that angry warrior with twenty shafts of diverse<br>kinds, he pierced Aswatthaman's driver, and then his four steeds with<br>four shafts. With. great deliberations and displaying a wonderful<br>lightness of hand, he cut off Aswatthaman's bow and standard, Satyaki<br>then cut into fragments the gold-decked car of this foe together with its<br>steeds. And then he deeply pierced Aswatthaman in the chest with thirty<br>arrows in that battle. Thus afflicted, O king, (by Satyaki), and shrouded<br>with arrows, the mighty Aswatthaman knew not what to do. When the<br>preceptor's son had fallen into that plight, thy son, that car-warrior,<br>accompanied by Kripa and Karna and others began to cover the Satwata hero<br>with arrows. All of them began quickly to pierce Satyaki from every side<br>with keen shafts, Duryodhana pierced him with twenty, Saradwat's son,<br>Kripa, with three. And Kritavarman pierced him with ten, and Karna with<br>fifty. And Duhsasana pierced him with a hundred arrows, and Vrishasena<br>with seven. Satyaki, however, O king, soon made all those great<br>car-warriors fly away from the field, deprived of their cars. Meanwhile,<br>Aswatthaman, O bull of Bharata's race, recovering consciousness, and<br>sighing repeatedly in sorrow, began to think of what he should do. Riding<br>then upon another car, that scorcher of foes, viz., the son of Drona,<br>began to resist Satyaki, shooting hundreds of arrows. Beholding<br>Aswatthaman once more approaching him in battle, the mighty car-warrior,<br>Satyaki, once more made him careless and caused him to turn back. Then<br>the Pandavas, O king, beholding the prowess of Satyaki, blew their conchs<br>with great force and uttered loud leonine roars. Having deprived<br>Aswatthaman of his car thus, Satyaki, of unbaffled prowess, then slew<br>three thousand mighty car-warriors of Vrishasena's division. And then he<br>slew fifteen thousand elephants of Kripa's force and fifty thousand<br>horses of Sakuni. Then, the valiant son of Drona, O monarch, riding upon<br>another car, and highly enraged with Satyaki, proceeded against the<br>latter, desirous of slaying him. Beholding him approach again, the<br>grandson of Sini, that chastiser of foes, once more pierced and mangled<br>him with keen shafts, fiercer than those he had used before. Deeply<br>pierced with those arrows of diverse forms by Yuyudhana, that great<br>bowmen, viz., the angry son of Drona, smilingly addressed his foe and<br>said, 'O grandson of Sini, I know thy partiality for Dhrishtadyumna, that<br>slayer of his preceptor, but thou shalt not be able to rescue him or your<br>own self when attacked by me. I swear to thee, O grandson of Sini, by<br>truth and by my ascetic austerities, that I shall know no peace till I<br>slay all the Panchalas. You may unite the forces of the Pandavas and<br>those of the Vrishnis together, but I shall still slay the Somakas.<br>Saying this, the son of Drona shot at Satyaki an excellent and straight<br>arrow possessed of the effulgence of the sun, even as Sakra had hurled in<br>days of yore his thunder at the Asura Vritra. Thus shot by Aswatthaman,<br>that arrow, piercing through the armour of Satyaki, and passing through<br>his body, entered the earth like a hissing snake entering its hole. His<br>armour pierced through, the heroic Satyaki, like an elephant deeply<br>struck with the hook, became bathed in blood that flowed from his wound.<br>His bow, with arrow fixed thereon, being then loosened from his grasp, he<br>sat down on the terrace of his car strengthless and covered all over with<br>blood. Seeing this his driver speedily bore him away from Drona's son.<br>With another shaft, perfectly straight and equipped with goodly wings<br>that scorcher of foes, viz., Aswatthaman, struck Dhrishtadyumna between<br>his eyebrows. The Panchala prince had before this been much pierced;<br>therefore, deeply wounded by that arrow, he became exceedingly weak and<br>supported himself by seizing his flag-staff. Beholding Dhrishtadyumna<br>thus afflicted by Aswatthaman, like an infuriated elephant by a lion,<br>five heroic car-warriors of the Pandava army, viz., Kiritin, Bhimasena,<br>Vrihatkshatra of Puru's race, the youthful prince of the Chedis, and<br>Sudarsana, the chief of the Malavas, quickly rushed against Aswatthaman.<br>Armed with bows, all these rushed with cries Oh and Alas. And those<br>heroes quickly encompassed the son of Drona on all sides. Advancing<br>twenty paces, all of them, with great care, simultaneously struck the<br>angry son of the preceptor with five and twenty arrows. Drona's son,<br>however, with five and twenty shafts, resembling snakes of virulent<br>poison, cut off, almost at the same time, those five and twenty arrows<br>shot at him. Then Aswatthaman afflicted the Paurava prince with seven<br>sharp shafts. And he afflicted the chief of the Malavas with three,<br>Partha with one, and Vrikodara with six shafts. Then all those great<br>car-warriors, O king, pierced Drona's son unitedly and separately with<br>many shafts, whetted on stone equipped with wings of gold. The youthful<br>prince of the Chedis pierced Drona's son with twenty and Partha pierced<br>him with three. Then Drona's son struck Arjuna with six arrows, and<br>Vasudeva with six, and Bhima with five, and each of the other two viz.,<br>the Malava and the Paurava, with two arrows. Piercing next the driver of'<br>Bhima's car with six arrows, Aswatthaman cut off Bhimasena's bow and<br>standard with a couple of arrows. Then piercing Partha once more with a<br>shower of arrows, Drona's son uttered a leonine roar. With the sharp,<br>well-tempered, and terrible arrows shot by Drona's son, the earth, the<br>sky, the firmament, and the points of the compass, cardinal and<br>subsidiary, all became entirely shrouded both in his front and rear.<br>Endued with fierce energy and equal to Indra himself in prowess,<br>Aswatthaman with three arrows, almost simultaneously cut off the two<br>arms, like unto Indra's poles, and the head of Sudarsana, as the latter<br>was seated on his car. Then piercing Paurava with a dart and cutting off<br>his car into minute fragments by means of his arrows, Aswatthaman lopped<br>off his antagonist's two arms smeared with sandal-paste and then his head<br>from off his trunk with a broad-headed shaft. Possessed of great<br>activity, he then pierced with many arrows resembling blazing flames of<br>fire in energy, the youthful and mighty prince of the Chedis who was of<br>the hue of the dark lotus, and despatched him to Yama's abode with his<br>driver and steeds. Beholding the chief of the Malavas, the descendant of<br>Puru, and the youthful ruler of the Chedis slain in this very sight by<br>the son of Drona.. Bhimasena, the mighty-armed son of Pandu, became<br>filled with rage. The scorcher of foes then covered Drona's son in that<br>battle with hundreds of keen arrows resembling angry snakes of virulent<br>poison. Endued with mighty energy, the angry son of Drona then destroying<br>that arrowy shower, pierced Bhimasena with sharp shafts. The mighty-armed<br>Bhima then, possessed of great strength, cut off with a broad-headed<br>arrow the bow of Drona's son and then pierced Drona's son himself with a<br>powerful shaft. Throwing away that broken bow, the high-souled son of<br>Drona took up another and pierced Bhima with his winged shafts. Then<br>those two, viz., Drona's son and Bhima, both possessed of great prowess<br>and might, began to shower their arrowy downpours like two masses of<br>rain-charged clouds. Gold-winged arrows, whetted on stone and engraved<br>with Bhima's name shrouded Drona's son, like gathering masses of clouds<br>shrouding the sun. Similarly, Bhima was soon shrouded with hundreds and<br>thousands of strong arrows shot by Drona's son. Though shrouded in that<br>battle by Drona's son, that warrior of great skill, Bhima yet felt no<br>pain, O monarch, which seemed exceedingly wonderful. Then the<br>mighty-armed Bhima sped ten gold-decked arrows, of great keenness and<br>resembling the darts of Yama himself, at his foe. Those shafts, O sire,<br>failing upon the shoulders of Drona's son, quickly pierced his body, like<br>snakes penetrating into an ant-hill. Deeply pierced by the high-souled<br>son of Pandu, Aswatthaman, closing his eyes, supported himself by seizing<br>his flagstaff. Recovering his senses within a moment, O king, Drona's son<br>bathed in blood, mustered all his wrath. Forcibly struck by the<br>high-souled son of Pandu, Aswatthaman, endued with mighty arms, rushed<br>with great speed towards the car of Bhimasena. And then, O Bharata, he<br>sped at Bhimasena, from his bow drawn to its fullest stretch, a hundred<br>arrows of fierce energy, all looking like snakes of virulent poison.<br>Pandu's son Bhima also, proud of his prowess in battle, disregarding<br>Aswatthaman's energy, speedily showered upon him dense arrowy downpour.<br>Then Drona's son, O king, cutting off Bhima's bow by means of his arrows,<br>and filled with rage, struck the Pandava in the chest with many keen<br>shafts. Incapable of brooking that feat, Bhimasena took up another bow<br>and pierced Drona's son in that battle with five keen shafts. Indeed,<br>showering upon each other their arrowy downpours like two masses of<br>clouds at the close of summer, two warriors, with eyes red as copper in<br>rage, completely covered each other in that battle with their shafts.<br>Frightening each other with the terrible sounds they made by their palms,<br>they continued to fight with each other, each counteracting the feats of<br>the other. Then bending his formidable bow adorned with gold, Drona's son<br>began to gaze steadfastly at Bhima who was thus shooting his shafts at<br>him. At that time, Aswatthaman looked like the meridian sun of blazing<br>rays in an autumnal day. So quickly then did he shoot his shafts that<br>people could not see when he took them out of his quiver when he fixed<br>them on the bowstring when he drew the string, and when he let them off.<br>Indeed, when employed in shooting his arrows, his bow, O monarch, seemed<br>to be incessantly drawn to fiery circle. Shafts in a hundred thousands,<br>shot from his bow, seemed to course through the welkin like a flight of<br>locusts. Indeed, those terrible shafts adorned with gold, shot from the<br>bow of Drona's son, coursed incessantly towards Bhima's car. The prowess,<br>O Bharata, that we then beheld of Bhimasena, and his might, energy, and<br>spirit, were exceedingly wonderful, for, regarding that terrible shower<br>of arrows thick as a gathering mass of clouds, failing around him to be<br>nothing more than a downpour of rain at the close of summer. Bhima of<br>terrible prowess, desirous of slaying the son of Drona, in return poured<br>his arrows upon the latter like a cloud in the season of rains. Bhima's<br>large and formidable bow of golden back, incessantly drawn in that<br>battle, looked resplendent like a second bow of Indra. Shafts in hundreds<br>and thousands, issuing from it, shrouded Drona's son, that ornament of<br>battle in that encounter. The showers of shafts, shot by both of them<br>were so dense, O sire, that the very wind, O king, could not find room<br>for coursing through them. Then Drona's son, O king, desirous of slaying<br>Bhima, sped at him many gold-decked arrows of keen points steeped in oil.<br>Showing his superiority to Drona's son Bhimasena cut off each of those<br>arrows into three fragments before they could come at him. The son of<br>Pandu then said, 'Wait Wait.' And once more, the mighty son of Pandu<br>filled with rage, and desirous of slaying the son of Drona, shot at him a<br>terrible shower of fierce arrows. Then Drona's son that warrior<br>acquainted with the highest weapons, quickly destroying that arrowy<br>shower by the illusion of his own weapons, cut off Bhima's bow in that<br>encounter. Filled with rage, he then pierced Bhima himself with<br>innumerable shafts in that battle. Endued with great might, Bhima then,<br>after his bow had been cut off, hurled a dart at Aswatthaman's car,<br>having whirled it previously with great impetuosity. The son of Drona,<br>displaying the lightness of his hand in that encounter, quickly cut off,<br>by means of sharp shafts, that dart as it coursed towards him with the<br>splendour of a blazing brand. Meanwhile, terrible Vrikodara, taking up a<br>very strong bow, and smiling the while, began to pierce the son of Drona<br>with many arrows. Then Drona's son, O monarch, with a straight shaft,<br>pierced the forehead of Bhima's driver. The latter, deeply pierced by the<br>mighty son of Drona, fell into a swoon, O king, abandoning the reins of<br>the steeds. The driver of the Bhima's car having fallen into a swoon, the<br>steeds, O king, began to fly away with great speed, in the very sight of<br>all the bowmen. Beholding Bhima carried away from the field of battle by<br>those running steeds, the unvanquished Aswatthaman joyfully blew his huge<br>conch. Beholding Bhimasena borne away from the field, all the Panchalas,<br>inspired with fear, abandoning the car of Dhrishtadyumna, fled away on<br>every side. Then Drona's son, shooting his shafts fiercely, pursued those<br>broken troops, causing a great carnage among them. Thus slaughtered in<br>battle by the son of Drona, those Kshatriyas fled away in all directions<br>from fear of that warrior.<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding that force broken, Kunti's son, Dhananjaya, of<br>immeasurable soul, proceeded against Aswatthaman from desire of slaying<br>him. Those troops then, O king, rallied with effort by Govinda and<br>Arjuna, stayed on the field of battle. Only Vibhatsu, supported by the<br>Somakas and the Matsyas, shot his arrows at the Kauravas and checked<br>their onset.[268] Quickly approaching Aswatthaman, that great bowman<br>having the mark of the lion's tail on his banner, Arjuna addressed him,<br>saying, 'Show me now the might thou hast, the energy, the knowledge, and<br>the manliness, that are in thee, as also thy affection for the<br>Dhartarashtras and thy hatred for us, and the high mettle of which thou<br>art capable. Even Prishata's son, that slayer of Drona, will quell thy<br>pride today. Come now and encounter the Panchala prince, that hero<br>resembling the Yuga fire and like the Destroyer himself with Govinda.<br>Thou hast displayed thy pride in battle, but I shall quell that pride of<br>thine.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'The preceptor's son, O Sanjaya, is possessed of<br>might and worthy of respect. He beareth great love to Dhananjaya and the<br>high-souled Dhananjaya also loveth him in return. Vibhatsu had never<br>addressed Drona's son before in this way. Why then did the son of Kunti<br>address his friend in such words?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Upon the fall of the youthful prince of the Chedis, of<br>Vrihatkshatra of Puru's race, and of Sudarsana, the chief of the Malavas,<br>who was well-accomplished in the science of arms, and upon the defeat of<br>Dhrishtadyumna and Satyaki and Bhima, and feeling great pain and touched<br>to the quick by those words of Yudhishthira, and remembering a his former<br>woes, O lord, Vibhatsu, in consequence of his grief, felt such wrath rise<br>within him the like of which he had never experienced before. It was for<br>this that like a vulgar person, he addressed the preceptor's son who was<br>worthy of every respect, in such unworthy, indecent, bitter, and harsh<br>language. Addressed, from wrath, in such harsh and cruel words by Partha,<br>O king, Drona's son, that foremost of all mighty bowmen, became highly<br>angry with Partha and especially with Krishna. The valiant Aswatthaman,<br>then, staying resolutely on his car, touched water and invoked the Agneya<br>weapon incapable of being resisted by the very gods. Aiming at all his<br>visible and invisible foes, the preceptor's son, that slayer of hostile<br>heroes, inspired with mantras a blazing shaft possessed of the effulgence<br>of a smokeless fire, and let it off on all sides, filled with rage. Dense<br>showers of arrows then issued from it in the welkin. Endued with fiery<br>flames, those arrows encompassed Partha on all sides. Meteors flashed<br>down from the firmament. A thick gloom suddenly shrouded the (Pandava)<br>host. All the points of the compass also were enveloped by that darkness.<br>Rakshasas and Pisachas, crowding together, uttered fierce cries.<br>Inauspicious winds began to blow. The sun himself no longer gave any<br>heat. Ravens fiercely croaked on all sides. Clouds roared in the welkin,<br>showering blood. Birds and beasts and kine, and Munis of high vows and<br>souls under complete control, became exceedingly uneasy. The very<br>elements seemed to be perturbed. The sun seemed to turn. The universe,<br>scorched with heat, seemed to be in a fever. The elephants and other<br>creatures of the land, scorched by the energy of that weapon, ran in<br>fright, breathing heavily and desirous of protection against that<br>terrible force. The very waters heated, the creatures residing in that<br>element, O Bharata, became exceedingly uneasy and seemed to burn. From<br>all the points of the compass, cardinal and subsidiary, from the<br>firmament and the very earth, showers of sharp and fierce arrows fell and<br>issued with the impetuosity of Garuda or the wind. Struck and burnt by<br>those shafts of Aswatthaman that were all endued with the impetuosity of<br>the thunder, the hostile warriors fell down like trees burnt down by a<br>raging fire. Huge elephants, burnt by that weapon, fell down on the earth<br>all around, uttering fierce cries loud as the rumblings of the clouds.<br>Other huge elephants, scorched by that fire, ran hither and thither, and<br>roared aloud in fear, as if in the midst of a forest conflagration. The<br>steeds, O king, and the cars also, burnt by the energy of that weapon,<br>looked, O sire, like the tops of trees burnt in a forest-fire. Thousands<br>of cars fell down on all sides. Indeed, O Bharata, it seemed that the<br>divine lord Agni burnt the (Pandava) host in that battle, like the<br>Samvarta fire consuming everything at the end of the Yuga.<br><br>'Beholding the Pandava army thus burning in that dreadful battle, thy<br>soldiers, O king, filled with joy, uttered leonine shouts. Indeed, the<br>combatants, desirous of victory and filled with joy, speedily blew<br>thousands of trumpets, O Bharata, of diverse kinds. Darkness having<br>enveloped the world during that fierce battle, the entire Pandava army,<br>with Savyasachin, the son of Panda, could not be seen. We had never<br>before, O king, heard of or seen the like of that weapon which Drona's<br>son created in wrath on that occasion. Then Arjuna, O king, invoked into<br>existence the Brahma weapon, capable of baffling every other weapon, as<br>ordained by the Lotus-born (Brahma) himself. Within a moment that<br>darkness was dispelled, cool winds began to blow, and all the points of<br>the compass became clear and bright. We then beheld a wonderful sight,<br>viz., a full Akshauhini (of the Pandava troops) laid low. Burnt by the<br>energy of Aswatthaman's weapon, the forms of the slain could not be<br>distinguished. Then those two heroic and mighty bowmen, viz., Kesava and<br>Arjuna, freed from that darkness, were seen together, like the sun and<br>the moon in the firmament. Indeed, the wielder of Gandiva and Kesava were<br>both unwounded. Equipped with its banners and standards and steeds, with<br>the Anukarsa unjoined; and with all the mighty weapons stored on it<br>remaining uninjured, that car, so terrible to thy warriors, freed from<br>that darkness, shone resplendent on the field. And soon there arose<br>diverse sounds of life mingled with the blare of conchs and the beat of<br>drums, from among the Pandava troops filled with joy. Both hosts thought<br>that Kesava and Arjuna had perished Beholding Kesava and Arjuna,<br>therefore (freed from darkness and the energy of that weapon) and seeing<br>that reappear so quickly, the Pandavas were filled with joy, and the<br>Kauravas with wonder. Unwounded and full of cheerfulness, those two<br>heroes blew their excellent conchs. Indeed, seeing Partha filled with<br>joy, thy soldiers became exceedingly melancholy. Seeing those two<br>high-souled ones (viz., Kesava and Arjuna), freed (from the energy of his<br>weapon) the son of Drona became very cheerless. For a moment he<br>reflected, O sire, on what had happened. And having reflected, O king, he<br>became filled with anxiety and grief. Breathing long and hot sighs, he<br>became exceedingly cheerless. Laying aside his bow, then, the son of<br>Drona speedily alighted from his car, and saying, 'O fie, fie! Every<br>thing is untrue,' he ran away from the fight. On his way he met Vyasa,<br>the abode of Saraswati, the compiler of the Vedas, the habitation of<br>those scriptures, unstained by sin, and of the hue of rain-charged cloud.<br>Beholding him, that perpetuator of Kura's race, standing on his way, the<br>son of Drona with voice choked in grief, and like one exceedingly<br>cheerless, saluted him and said, 'O sire, O sire, is this an illusion, or<br>is it a caprice (on the part of the weapon)? I do not know what it is.<br>Why, indeed, hath my weapon become fruitless? What breach (has there been<br>in the method of invocation)? Or, is it something abnormal, or, is it a<br>victory over Nature (achieved by the two Krishnas) since they are yet<br>alive? It seems that Time is irresistible. Neither Asuras, nor<br>Gandharvas, nor Pisachas, nor Rakshasas, nor Uragas, Yakshas, and birds,<br>nor human beings, can venture to baffle this weapon shot by me. This<br>fiery weapon, however, having slain only one Akshauhini of troops, hath<br>been pacified. This exceedingly fierce weapon shot by me is capable of<br>slaying all creatures. For what reason then could it not slay Kesava and<br>Arjuna, both of whom are endued with the attributes of humanity? Asked by<br>me, O holy one, answer me truly. O great Muni, I desire to hear all this<br>in detail.'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'O highly significant is this matter that thou enquirest of<br>me from surprise. I will tell thee everything; listen attentively. He<br>that is called Narayana is older than the oldest ones. For accomplishing<br>some purpose, that creator of the universe took his birth as the son of<br>Dharma. On the mountain of Himavat he underwent the severest ascetic<br>austerities. Endued with mighty energy, and resembling fire or the sun<br>(in splendour), he stood there with arms upraised. Possessed of eyes<br>like: lotus-petals, he emaciated himself there for sixty-six thousand<br>years, subsisting all the while upon air alone. Once more undergoing<br>severe austerities of another kind for twice that period, he filled the<br>space between earth and heaven with his energy. When by those<br>austerities, O sire, he became: like Brahma[269] he then beheld the<br>Master, Origin, and Guardian of the Universe, the Lord of all the gods,<br>the Supreme Deity, who is exceedingly difficult of being gazed at, who is<br>minuter than the minutest and larger than, the largest, who is called<br>Rudra,[270] who is the lord of all the superior ones, who is called Hara<br>and Sambhu, who has matted locks on his head, who is the infuser of life<br>into every form, who is the First cause of all immobile: and mobile<br>things, who is irresistible and of frightful aspect, who is of fierce<br>wrath and great Soul, who is the All-destroyer, and of large heart; who<br>beareth the celestial bow and a couple of quivers, who is cased in golden<br>armour, and whose energy is infinite, who holdeth Pinaka, who is; armed<br>with thunderbolt, a blazing trident, battle axe, mace, and a large sword;<br>whose eye-brows are fair, whose locks are matted, who wieldeth the heavy<br>short club, who hath the moon on his forehead, who is clad in tiger-skin,<br>and who is armed with the bludgeon; who is decked with beautiful angadas,<br>who hath snakes for his sacred thread, and who is surrounded by diverse<br>creatures of the universe and by numerous ghosts and spirits, who is the<br>One, who is the abode of ascetic austerities, and who is highly adored by<br>persons of venerable age; who is Water, Heaven, Sky, Earth, Sun, Moon,<br>Wind and Fire, and who is the measure of the duration of the universe.<br>Persons of wicked behaviour can never obtain a sight of that unborn one,<br>that slayer of all haters of Brahmanas, that giver of emancipation.[271]<br>Only Brahmanas of righteous conduct, when cleansed of their sins and<br>freed from the control of grief, behold him with their mind's eye. In<br>consequence of his ascetic austerities, Narayana obtained a sight of that<br>unfading one, that embodiment of righteousness, that adorable one, that<br>Being having the universe for his form. Beholding that supreme Abode of<br>all kinds of splendour, that God with a garland of Akshas round his neck,<br>Vasudeva, with gratified soul, became filled with delight which he sought<br>to express by words, heart, understanding, and body. Then Narayana<br>worshipped that Divine Lord, that First cause of the universe, that giver<br>of boons, that puissant one sporting with the fair-limbed Parvati, that<br>high-souled Being surrounded by large bands of ghosts, spirits, that<br>Unborn one, that Supreme Lord, that Embodiment of the unmanifest, that<br>Essence of all causes, that One of unfading power. Having saluted Rudra,<br>that destroyer of the Asura Andhaka, the lotus eyed Narayana, with<br>emotion filling his heart, began to praise the Three-eyed one (in these<br>words), 'O adorable one, O first of all the gods, the creator of<br>everything (viz., the Prajapatis) who are the regents of the world, and<br>who having entered the earth,&#8212;thy first work,&#8212;had, O lord, protected it<br>before, have all sprung from thee. Gods, Asuras, Nagas, Rakshasas,<br>Pisachas, human beings, birds, Gandharvas, Yakshas and other creatures:<br>with the entire universe, we know, have all sprung from thee. Everything<br>that is done for propitiating Indra, and Yama, and Varuna, and Kuvera and<br>Pitris and Tvashtri, and Soma, is really offered to thee. Form and light,<br>sound and sky, wind and touch, taste and water, scent and earth,[272]<br>time, Brahma himself, the Vedas, the Brahmanas and all these mobile<br>objects, have sprung from thee. Vapours rising from diverse receptacles<br>of water, becoming rain-drops, which failing upon the earth, are<br>separated from one another. When the time of the Universal dissolution<br>comes those individual drops, separated from one another, once more unite<br>together and make the earth one vast expanse of water. He that is<br>learned, thus observing the origin and the destruction, of all things,<br>understands thy oneness. Two birds (viz., Iswara and Jiva), four<br>Aswatthas with their wordy branches (viz., the Vedas), the seven<br>guardians (viz., the five essences or elements and the heart and the<br>understanding), and the ten others that hold this city (viz., the ten<br>senses that constitute the body), have all been created by thee, but thou<br>art separate from and independent of them. The Past, the Future, and the<br>Present, over each of which none can have any sway, are from thee, as<br>also the seven worlds and this universe. I am thy devoted adorer,&#8212;be<br>graceful unto me. Do not injure me, by causing evil thoughts to penetrate<br>my heart. Thou art the Soul of souls, incapable of being known. He that<br>knows thee as the Universal Seed, attaineth to Brahma. Desiring to pay<br>thee respects, I am praising thee, endeavouring to ascertain thy real<br>nature, O thou that art incapable of being understood by the very gods.<br>Adored by me, grant me the boons I desire but which are difficult of<br>acquisition. Do not hide thyself in thy illusion.'<br><br>"Vyasa continued, 'The blue-throated God, of inconceivable soul, that<br>wielder of Pinaka, that divine Lord ever praised by the Rishis, then gave<br>boons unto Vasudeva who deserved them all. The great God said, 'O<br>Narayana, through my grace, amongst men, gods, and Gandharvas, thou shalt<br>be of immeasurable might and soul. Neither gods, nor Asuras, nor great<br>Uragas, nor Pisachas, nor Gandharvas, nor men, nor Rakshasas, nor birds,<br>nor Nagas, nor any creatures in the Universe, shall ever be able to bear<br>thy prowess. No one amongst even the celestials shall be able to vanquish<br>thee in battle. Through my grace, none shall ever be able to cause thee<br>pain by the weapon of thunderbolt or with any object that is wet or dry,<br>or with any mobile or immobile thing. Thou shalt be superior to myself if<br>thou ever goest to battle against me.' Thus were these boons acquired by<br>Sauri in days of yore. Even that God now walketh the earth (as Vasudeva),<br>beguiling the universe by his illusion. From Narayana's asceticism was<br>born a great Muni of the name of Nara, equal to Narayana himself. Know<br>that Arjuna is none else than that Nara. Those two Rishis, said to be<br>older than the oldest gods, take their births in every Yuga for serving<br>the purposes of the world. Thyself also, O thou of great heart, hast been<br>born as a portion of Rudra, by virtue of all thy religious acts and as a<br>consequence of high ascetic austerities, endued with great energy and<br>wrath. Thou wert (in a former life) endued with great wisdom and equal to<br>a god. Regarding the universe to consist only of Mahadeva, thou hadst<br>emaciated thyself by diverse vows from desire of gratifying that God.<br>Assuming the form of a very superior person, that blazes fourth with<br>splendour, thou hast, O giver of honours, worshipped the great god with<br>mantras, with homa, and with offerings. Thus adored by thee in thy former<br>life, the great god became gratified with thee, and granted thee numerous<br>boons, O learned one, that thou hadst cherished in thy heart. Like<br>Kesava's and Arjuna's thy birth acts, and ascetic austerities are also<br>superior. Like them, in thy worship, thou hast, in every Yuga, adored the<br>great God in his Phallic form. Kesava is that devoted worshipper of Rudra<br>who has sprung from Rudra himself. Kesava always worship the Lord Siva,<br>regarding his Phallic emblem to be the origin of the universe. In Kesava<br>is always present that knowledge, in consequence of which he views the<br>identity of Brahman with the: universe and that other knowledge by which<br>the Past, the Present and the Future, the near and the remote, are all<br>seen, as if the whole are before his eyes. The gods, the Siddhas and the<br>great Rishis, adore Kesava for obtaining that highest object in the<br>universe, viz., Mahadeva. Kesava is the creator of everything. The<br>Eternal Krishna should be adored with sacrifices. The Lord Kesava always<br>worshippeth Siva in the Phallic emblem as the origin of all creatures.<br>The God having the bull for his mark cherisheth greater regard for<br>Kesava.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing these words of Vyasa, Drona's son, that<br>mighty car-warrior, bowed unto Rudra and regarded Kesava as worthy of the<br>highest regards. Having his soul under complete control, he became filled<br>with delight, the marks whereof appeared on his body. Bowing unto the<br>great Rishi, Aswatthaman then, casting his eyes on the (Kuru) army,<br>caused it-to be withdrawn (for nightly rest). Indeed, when, after the<br>fall of Drona, the cheerless Kurus retired from the field, the Pandavas<br>also, O monarch, caused their army to be withdrawn. Having fought for<br>five days and caused an immense carnage, that Brahman well-versed in the<br>Vedas, viz., Drona, repaired, O king, to the region of Brahma!'."
