                            "Sanjaya said, 'Thou askest me about the feats of Arjuna in battle.<br>Listen, O thou of mighty arms, to what Partha achieved in the fight.<br>Beholding the risen dust and hearing the wail of the troops when<br>Bhagadatta was performing great feats on the field, the son of Kunti<br>addressed Krishna and said 'O slayer of Madhu, it seems that the ruler of<br>the Pragjyotishas hath, on his elephant, with great impetuosity, advanced<br>to battle. This loud din that we hear must be due to him. Well-versed in<br>the art of grinding and battling from the back of an elephant, and not<br>inferior to Indra himself in battle, he, I think, is the formost of all<br>elephant-warriors in the world.[54] His elephant, again, is the foremost<br>of elephants, without a rival to encounter it in battle. Possessed of<br>great dexterity and above all fatigue, it is, again, impervious to all<br>weapons. Capable of bearing every weapon and even the touch of fire, it<br>will, O sinless one, alone destroy the Pandava force today. Except us<br>two, there is none else capable of checking that creature. Go quickly,<br>therefore, to that spot where the ruler of the Pragjyotishas is. Proud in<br>battle, in consequence of the strength of his elephant, and arrogant in<br>consequence of his age, I will this very day send him as a guest to the<br>slayer of Vala.' At these words of Arjuna, Krishna began to proceed to<br>the place where Bhagadatta was breaking the Pandava ranks. While Arjuna<br>was proceeding towards Bhagadatta, the mighty Samsaptaka car-warriors,<br>numbering fourteen thousand, made up of ten thousand Gopalas or Narayanas<br>who used to follow Vasudeva, returning to the field, summoned him to<br>battle. Beholding the Pandava host broken by Bhagadatta, and summoned on<br>the other hand by the Samsaptakas, Arjuna's heart was divided in twain.<br>And he began to think, 'Which of these two act will be better for me to<br>do today, to return from this spot for battling with Samsaptakas or to<br>repair to Yudhishthira?' Reflecting with the aid of his understanding, O<br>perpetuator of Kuru's race, Arjuna's heart, at last, was firmly fixed on<br>the slaughter of the Samsaptakas. Desirous of alone slaughtering in<br>battle thousands of car-warriors, Indra's son (Arjuna) having the<br>foremost of apes on banner, suddenly turned back. Even this was what both<br>Duryodhana and Karna had thought of for achieving the slaughter of<br>Arjuna. And it was for this that they had made arrangements for the<br>double encounter. The son of Pandu allowed his heart to waver this side<br>and that, but, at last, resolving to slay those foremost of warriors,<br>viz., the Samsaptakas, he baffled the purpose of his enemies.[55] Then<br>mighty Samsaptakas car-warriors, O king, shot at Arjuna thousands of<br>straight arrows. Covered with those arrows, O monarch, neither Kunti's<br>son Partha, nor Krishna, otherwise called Janardana, nor the steeds, nor<br>the car, could be seen. Then Janardana became deprived of his senses and<br>perspired greatly. Thereupon, Partha shot the Brahma weapon and nearly<br>exterminated them all. Hundreds upon hundreds of arms with bows and<br>arrows and bowstrings in grasp, cut off from trunks, and hundreds upon<br>hundreds of standards and steeds and charioteers and car-warriors, fell<br>down on the ground. Huge elephants, well-equipped and resembling foremost<br>hills over-grown with woods or masses of clouds, afflicted with Partha's<br>shafts and deprived of riders, fell down on the earth. Many elephants<br>again, with riders on their backs, crushed by means of Arjuna's shafts,<br>fell down, deprived of life, shorn of the embroidered cloths on their<br>backs, and with their housings torn. Cut off by Kiritin with his<br>broad-headed arrows, countless arms having swords and lances and rapiers<br>for their nails or having clubs and battle-axes in grasp, fell down on<br>the earth. Heads also, beautiful, O king, as the morning sun or the lotus<br>or the moon, cut off by Arjuna with his arrows, dropped down on the<br>ground. While Phalguni in rage was thus engaged in slaying the foe with<br>diverse kinds of well-adorned and fatal shafts, that host seemed to be<br>ablaze. Beholding Dhanunjaya crushing that host like an elephant crushing<br>lotus-stalks, all creatures applauded him, saying, 'Excellent,<br>Excellent!' Seeing that feat of Partha resembling that of Vasava himself,<br>Madhava wondered much and, addressing him with joined hands, said,<br>'Verily, O Partha, I think that this feat which thou hast achieved, could<br>not be performed by Sakra, or Yama, or the Lord of treasures himself. I<br>see that thou hast today felled in battle hundreds and thousands of<br>mighty Samsaptaka warriors an together.' Having slain the Samsaptakas<br>then,&#8212;that is, who were engaged in battle,&#8212;Partha addressed Krishna,<br>saying, 'Go towards Bhagadatta.'"
