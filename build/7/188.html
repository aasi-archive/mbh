                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then Duhsasana, filled with wrath, rushed against<br>Sahadeva, causing the earth to tremble with the fierce speed of his car,<br>O Madri's son, however, that crusher of foes, with a broad-headed arrow,<br>quickly cut of the head, decked with the head-gear of his rushing<br>antagonist's driver. From the celerity with which that act was<br>accomplished by Sahadeva, neither Duhsasana nor any of the troops knew<br>that the driver's head had been cut off. The reins being no longer held<br>by anybody, the steeds ran at their will. It was then that Duhsasana knew<br>that his driver had been slain. Conversant with the management of steeds,<br>that foremost of car-warriors, himself restraining his steeds in that<br>battle fought beautifully and with great activity and skill. That feat of<br>his was applauded by friends and foes, since riding on that driverless<br>car, he careered fearlessly in that battle. Then Sahadeva pierced those<br>steeds with keen shafts. Afflicted with those shafts, they quickly ran<br>away, careering hither and thither. For catching hold of the reins, he<br>once laid aside his bow, and then he took up his bow for using it, lying<br>aside the reins. During those opportunities the son of Madri covered him<br>with arrows. Then Karna, desirous of rescuing thy son, rushed to that<br>spot. Thereupon, Vrikodara, with great care, pierced Karna in the chest<br>and arms with three broad-headed shafts sped from his bow drawn to its<br>fullest stretch. Struck with those shafts like a snake with a stick,<br>Karna stopped and began to resist Bhimasena, shooting keen shafts.<br>Thereupon, a fierce battle took place between Bhima and Radha's son. Both<br>of them roared like bulls, and the eyes of both were expanded (with<br>rage). Excited with wrath, and rushing towards each other, with great<br>speed, they roared at each other. Those two delighters, in battle were<br>then very close to each other. So near were they that they could not<br>easily shoot their shafts at each other. Thereupon, an encounter with<br>maces happened. Bhimasena speedily broke with his mace the Kuvara of<br>Karna's car. That feat of his, O king, seemed highly wonderful. Then the<br>valiant son of Radha, taking up a mace, hurled it at Bhima's car. Bhima,<br>however, broke it with the mace of his own. Then taking up a heavy mace,<br>once more, Bhima hurled it at Adhiratha's son. Karna struck that mace<br>with numerous shafts of beautiful wings, sped with great force, and once<br>again with other shafts, Thus struck with Karna's shafts, the mace turned<br>back towards Bhima, like a snake afflicted with incantations. With the<br>rebound of that mace, the huge standard of Bhima, broke and fell down.<br>Struck with that same mace, Bhima's driver also became deprived of his<br>senses. Then Bhima, mad with rage, sped eight shafts at Karna, and his<br>standard and bow, and leathern fence, O Bharata. The mighty Bhimasena,<br>that slayer of hostile heroes, with the greatest care, O Bharata, cut<br>off, with those keen shafts, the standards, the bow, and the leathern<br>fence of Karna. The latter then, viz., the son of Radha, taking up<br>another invincible and gold-decked bow, shot a number of shafts, and<br>quickly slew Bhima's steeds of the hue of bears, and then his two<br>drivers. When his car was thus injured, Bhima, that chastiser of foes,<br>quickly jumped into the car of Nakula like a lion jumping down upon a<br>mountain summit.'<br><br>"Meanwhile, Drona and Arjuna, those two foremost of car-warriors,<br>preceptor and pupil, both skilled in weapon, O monarch, fought with each<br>other in battle, stupefying the eyes and minds of men with their<br>lightness in the use of weapons and the sureness of their aim, and with<br>the motions of their cars. Beholding that battle, the like of which had<br>never been witnessed before, between preceptor and pupil, the other<br>warriors abstained from fighting with each other and trembled. Each of<br>those heroes, displaying beautiful revolutions of his car, wished to<br>place the other on his right. The warriors present there beheld their<br>prowess and became filled with wonder. Indeed, that great battle between<br>Drona and the son of Pandu resembled that, O monarch, between a couple of<br>hawks in the welkin for the sake of a piece of meat. Whatever feats Drona<br>performed for vanquishing the son of Kunti, were all counteracted by<br>Arjuna's performing similar feats. When Drona failed to gain any<br>ascendency over the son of Pandu, the son of Bharadwaja, that warrior<br>acquainted with the course of all weapons, invoked into existence the<br>Aindra, the Pasupata, the Tvashtra, the Vayavya, and the Yamya weapons.<br>As soon as those weapons, issued from Drona's bow, Dhananjaya destroyed<br>them quickly. When his weapons were thus duly destroyed by Arjuna with<br>his own weapons, Drona shrouded the son of Pandu with the mightiest of<br>celestial weapons. Every weapon, however, that Drona shot at Partha from<br>desire of vanquishing the latter, was shot by Partha in return for<br>baffling it. Seeing all his weapons, even the celestial ones, duly<br>baffled by Arjuna, Drona applauded the latter in his heart. That<br>chastiser of foes, O Bharata, regarded himself superior to every person<br>in the world acquainted with weapons, in consequence of Arjuna having<br>been his pupil. Thus resisted by Partha in the midst of all those<br>illustrious warriors, Drona, struggling with vigour, cheerfully resisted<br>Arjuna (in return), wondering all the while. Then the celestials and<br>Gandharvas in thousands, and Rishis and bodies of Siddhas, were seen on<br>all sides in the welkin. Filled with (those as also with) Apsaras and<br>Yakshas and Rakshasas, it once more seemed that the welkin was darkened<br>by gathering clouds. An invisible voice, fraught with the praises of<br>Drona and the high-souled Partha, was heard to repeatedly course through<br>the firmament. When in consequence of the weapons shot by Drona and<br>Partha all sides seemed ablaze with light, the Siddhas and the Rishis<br>that were present, said, 'This is no human nor Asura, nor Rakshasa, nor<br>celestial, nor Gandharva battle. Without doubt this is a high Brahma<br>encounter. This battle is exceedingly beautiful and highly wonderful. We<br>have never seen or heard of its like. Now, the preceptor prevails over<br>the son of Pandu, and then the son of Pandu prevails over Drona. No one<br>can find any difference between them. If Rudra, dividing his own self<br>into two portions, fights, himself with himself, then may an instance be<br>had to match this. Nowhere else can an instance be found to match it.<br>Science, gathered in one place, exists in the preceptor; science and<br>means are in the son of Pandu. Heroism, in one place, is in Drona;<br>heroism and might are in the son of Pandu. None of these warriors can be<br>withstood by foes in battle. If they wish, both of them can destroy the<br>universe with the gods. Beholding those two bulls among men, all<br>invisible and visible creatures said these words. The high-souled Drona<br>then, in that battle, invoked into existence the Brahma weapon,<br>afflicting Partha and all invisible beings. Thereupon, the earth with the<br>mountains and waters and trees trembled. Fierce winds began to blow. The<br>seas swelled in agitation. The combatants of the Kurus and the Pandava<br>armies, as also all other creatures, became inspired with fear, when that<br>illustrious warrior uplifted that weapon. The Partha, O monarch,<br>fearlessly baffled that weapon by a Brahma weapon of his own, at which<br>all that agitation in nature was speedily pacified. At last, when none of<br>them could vanquish his antagonist in combat, a general engagement took<br>place between the hosts, causing a great confusion on the field. During<br>the progress of that dreadful battle between Drona and the son of Pandu<br>(as also of that general engagement), once more, O king, nothing could be<br>distinguished. The welkin became covered with dense showers of shafts, as<br>if with masses of clouds, and creatures ranging in the air could no<br>longer find a passage through their element."
