                            "Vasudeva said, 'Behold, O Dhananjaya, this Suyodhana who hath<br>transgressed us! I regard this as highly wonderful. There is no<br>car-warrior equal to him. His arrows are far-reaching. He is a great<br>bowman. Accomplished as he is in weapons, it is exceedingly difficult to<br>vanquish him in battle. The mighty son of Dhritarashtra strikes hard, and<br>is conversant with all modes of warfare. Brought up in great luxury, he<br>is much regarded by even the foremost of car-warriors. He is<br>well-accomplished, and, O Partha, he always hates the Pandavas. For these<br>reasons, O sinless one, I think, thou shouldst now fight with him. Upon<br>him resteth, as upon a stake at dice, victory or the reverse. Upon him, O<br>Partha, vomit that poison of thy wrath which thou hast cherished so long.<br>This mighty car-warrior is the root of all the wrongs on the Pandavas. He<br>is now within reach of thy shafts. Look after thy success. Why hath king<br>Duryodhana, desirous as he is of kingdom, come to battle with thee? By<br>good luck, it is that he is now arrived within reach of thy arrows. Do<br>that, O Dhananjaya, by which he may be deprived on his very life. Reft of<br>his senses through pride of affluence, he hath never felt any distress. O<br>bull among men, he doth not know also thy prowess in battle. Indeed, the<br>three worlds with the celestials, the Asuras, and human beings, cannot<br>venture to vanquish thee in battle. What need be said, therefore, of<br>single Duryodhana? By good luck it is, O Partha, that he hath approached<br>the vicinity of thy car. O mighty-armed one, slay him as Purandara slew<br>Vritra. O sinless one, this Duryodhana hath endeavoured to bring evil on<br>you. By deceit he cheated king Yudhishthira at dice. O giver of honours,<br>sinless though you all are, this prince of sinful soul has always done<br>various evil acts towards him. Nobly resolved upon battle, O Partha, slay<br>without any scruple this wicked wight, who is ever wrathful and ever<br>cruel, and who is the very embodiment of avarice. Remembering the<br>deprivation of your kingdom by deceit, your exile into the woods, and the<br>wrongs of Krishna, put forth thy prowess, O son of Pandu! By good luck,<br>it is that he stayeth within the range of the shafts. By good luck, it is<br>that staying before thee he endeavours to resist thy purpose. By good<br>luck, it is that he knows today that he will have to fight with thee in<br>the battle. By good luck, it is that all your purposes, even those that<br>are not presently entertained by you, will be crowned with fruition.<br>Therefore, Partha, slay this wretch of his race, viz., the son of<br>Dhritarashtra, in battle, as Indra had in days of yore, slain the Asura<br>Jambha in the battle between the celestials and the Asuras. If he is<br>slain by thee, thou canst then pierce through this masterless host. Cut<br>the very root of these wicked-souled wretches. Let the avabhritha[145] of<br>this hostility be now accomplished.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed, Partha replied unto Kesava<br>saying&#8212;'So be it. Even this should be done by me. Disregarding<br>everything else, proceed thither where Duryodhana is. Putting forth my<br>prowess in battle, I will cut off the head of that wretch who hath for<br>such a long period enjoyed our kingdom without a thorn on his side. Shall<br>I not succeed, O Kesava, in avenging myself of the insult, in the shape<br>of dragging her by the hair, offered unto Draupadi, undeserving as she<br>was of that wrong.' Thus conversing with each other, the two Krishnas<br>filled with joy, urged those excellent white steeds of theirs, desirous<br>of getting at king Duryodhana. As regards thy son, O bull of Bharata's<br>race, having approached the presence of Partha and Krishna, he<br>entertained no fear, although, O sire, every circumstance was calculated<br>to inspire fear. And the Kshatriyas there, on thy side, highly applauded<br>him then, for he proceeded to face Arjuna and Hrishikesa for resisting<br>them. Indeed, beholding the king in battle, a loud shout was heard there,<br>O monarch, uttered by the entire Kuru army. What that terrible and awful<br>shout arose there, thy son, pressing his foe hard, opposed his progress.<br>Held in check by thy son armed with bow, the son of Kunti became filled<br>with rage, and that chastiser of foes, Duryodhana, also became highly<br>enraged with Partha. Beholding both Duryodhana and Dhananjaya enraged<br>with each other, all the Kshatriyas, of fierce forms, began to look at<br>them from all sides. Seeing Partha and Vasudeva both filled with rage,<br>thy son, O sire, desirous of battle, smilingly challenged them, then he<br>of Dasarha's race became filled with joy, and Dhananjaya also, the son of<br>Pandu, became cheerful. Uttering loud roars, they both blew their<br>foremost of conchs. Seeing them thus cheerful, all the Kauravas became<br>hopeless of thy son's life. Indeed, all the Kauravas, and many even<br>amongst the enemy, became possessed with grief, and regarded thy son as a<br>libation already poured into the mouth of the (sacred) fire. Thy<br>warriors, seeing Krishna and the Pandava so cheerful I loudly exclaimed,<br>afflicted with fear, 'The king is slain.' 'The king is slain.' Hearing<br>that loud uproar of the warriors, Duryodhana said, 'Let your fears be<br>dispelled. I will despatch the two Krishnas unto the region of death.'<br>Having told all his warriors these words, king Duryodhana. then,<br>expectant of success, addressed Partha angrily and said these words: 'If,<br>O Partha, thou art begotten by Pandu apply upon me, without loss of time,<br>all the weapons, celestial and earthly, that Kesava also hath of either,<br>upon me. I wish to see thy manliness. They speak of many feats achieved<br>by thee out of our view. Show me those feats that have won the applause<br>of many endued with great heroism!'"
