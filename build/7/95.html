                            "Sanjaya said, 'Listen, O king, to me as I describe to thee the wonderful<br>battle that then took place between the Kurus and the Pandavas.<br>Approaching Bharadwaja's son who was staying at the gate of his array,<br>the Parthas battled vigorously for piercing through Drona's division. And<br>Drona also, accompanied by his forces, desirous of protecting his own<br>array, battled with the Parthas, seeking glory. Vinda and Anuvinda of<br>Avanti, excited with wrath and desirous of benefiting thy son, struck<br>Virata with ten shafts. Virata also, O king, approaching those two<br>warriors of great prowess staying in battle, fought with them and their<br>followers. The battle that took place between these was fierce in the<br>extreme, and blood ran in it like water. And it resembled an encounter in<br>the woods between a lion and a couple of mighty elephants, with rent<br>temples. The mighty son of Yajnasena forcibly struck king Valhika in that<br>battle with fierce and sharp shafts capable of penetrating into the very<br>vitals. Valhika also filled with wrath, deeply pierced Yajnasena's son<br>with nine straight shafts of golden wings and whetted on stone. And that<br>battle between those two warriors became exceedingly fierce,<br>characterised as it was by dense showers of shafts and darts. And it<br>enhanced the fears of the timid and the joy of heroes. The arrows shot by<br>them entirely covered the welkin and all the points of the compass, so<br>that nothing could any longer be discerned. And Saivya, the king of the<br>Govasanas on the head of the troops, fought in that battle with the<br>mighty car-warrior, the prince of the Kasis, like an elephant battling<br>with another. The king of the Valhikas, excited with wrath, fighting,<br>against those (five) mighty car-warriors, viz., the son of Draupadi,<br>looked resplendent, like the mind contending against the five senses. And<br>those five princes also, O foremost of embodied beings, fought with that<br>antagonist of theirs, shooting their arrows from all sides, like the<br>objects of the senses for ever battling with the body. Thy son Duhsasana,<br>struck Satyaki of Vrishni's race with nine straight shafts of keen<br>points. Deeply pierced by that strong and great bowman, Satyaki of<br>prowess incapable of being baffled, was partially deprived of his senses.<br>Comforted soon, he, of Vrishni's race, then quickly pierced thy son, that<br>mighty car-warrior, with ten shafts winged with Kanka feathers. Piercing<br>each other deeply and afflicted with each other's shafts, they looked<br>splendid, O king, like two Kinsukas decked with flowers. Afflicted with<br>the arrows of Kuntibhoja, Alamvusha, filled with wrath looked like a<br>beautiful Kinsuka graced with its flowering burthen. The Rakshasa then<br>having pierced Kuntibhoja with many arrows, uttered awful shouts at the<br>head of thy host. And as those heroes fought with each other in that<br>battle, they seemed to all the troops to resemble Sakra and the Asura<br>Jambha in days of old. The two sons of Madri, filled with wrath, fiercely<br>ground with their shafts the Gandhara prince Sakuni who had offended<br>against them greatly. The carnage, O monarch, that set in was awful.<br>Originated by thee, nurtured by Karna, and kept up by thy sons, the fire<br>of wrath (of the Pandavas) hath swollen now, O monarch, and is ready to<br>consume the whole earth. Forced to turn his back on the field by the two<br>sons of Pandu with their shafts, Sakuni unable to put forth his valour,<br>knew not what to do. Beholding him turn back, those mighty car-warriors,<br>viz., the two sons of Pandu, once more showered their arrows on him like<br>two masses of clouds pouring torrents of rain on a mighty hill. Struck<br>with countless straight shafts, the son of Suvala fled towards the<br>division of Drona, borne by his swift steeds. The brave Ghatotkacha<br>rushed towards the Rakshasa Alamvusha in that battle, with impetuosity<br>much short of what he was capable. The battle between those two became<br>fearful to behold, like that which in days of yore had taken place<br>between Rama and Ravana. King Yudhishthira, having in that battle pierced<br>the ruler of the Madras with five hundred arrows, once more pierced him<br>with seven. Then commenced that battle between them which was exceedingly<br>wonderful, O monarch, which resembled that, in days of yore, between the<br>Asura Samvara and the chief of the celestials. The sons Vivinsati and<br>Chitrasena and Vikarna, surrounded by a large force, battled with<br>Bhimasena.'"
