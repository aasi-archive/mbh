                            "Sanjaya said, 'Hearing the twang of Bhimasena's bow and the sound of his<br>palms, the son of Radha could not brook it, like an infuriated elephant<br>incapable of brooking the roars of an infuriated rival. Returning for a<br>moment from before Bhimasena, Karna cast his eyes upon those sons of<br>thine that had been slain by Bhimasena, Beholding them, O best of men,<br>Karna became cheerless and plunged in grief. Breathing hot and long<br>sighs, he, once more, proceeded against the son of Pandu. With eyes red<br>as copper, and sighing in wrath like a mighty snake, Karna then, as he<br>shot his arrows, looked resplendent like the sun scattering his<br>rays.[159] Indeed, O bull of Bharata's race, Vrikodara was then covered<br>with the arrows, resembling the spreading rays of the sun that were shot<br>from Karna's bow. The beautiful shafts, equipped with peacock-feathers,<br>shot from Karna's bow, penetrated into every part of Bhima's body, like<br>birds into a tree for roosting there. Indeed, the arrows, equipped with<br>wings of gold, shot from Karna's bow falling incessantly, resembled<br>continuous rows of cranes. So numerous were the shafts shot by<br>Adhiratha's son that, these seemed to issue not from his bow alone but<br>from his standard, his umbrella, and the shaft and yoke and bottom of his<br>car also. Indeed, Adhiratha's son shot his sky-ranging shafts of<br>impetuous energy, decked with gold and equipped with vulturine feathers,<br>in such a way as to fill the entire welkin with them. Beholding him<br>(thus) excited with fury and rushing towards him like the Destroyer<br>himself, Vrikodara, becoming utterly reckless of his life and prevailing<br>over his foe, pierced him with nine shafts.[160] Beholding the<br>irresistible impetuosity of Karna as also that dense shower of arrows,<br>Bhima, endued as he was with great prowess, quailed not in fear. The son<br>of Pandu then counteracting that arrowy downpour of Adhiratha's son,<br>pierced Karna himself with twenty other sharp shafts. Indeed, as Pritha's<br>son himself had before been shrouded by the Suta's son, even so was the<br>latter now shrouded by the former in that battle. Beholding the prowess<br>of Bhimasena in battle, thy warriors, as also the Gharanas, filled with<br>joy; applauded him. Bhurisravas, and Kripa, and Drona's son, and the<br>ruler of the Madras, and Uttamaujas and Yudhamanyu, and Kesava, and<br>Arjuna,&#8212;these great car-warriors: O king, among both the Kurus and the<br>Pandavas,&#8212;loudly cheered Bhima, saying, 'Excellent, Excellent,' and<br>uttered leonine roars. When that fierce uproar, making the hair stand on<br>end rose, thy son Duryodhana, O king, quickly said unto all the kings and<br>princes and particularly his uterine brothers, these words, 'Blessed be<br>ye, proceed towards Karna for rescuing him from Vrikodara, else the<br>shafts shot from Bhima's bow will slay the son of Radha. Ye mighty<br>bowmen, strive ye to protect the Suta's son.' Thus commanded by<br>Duryodhana, seven of his uterine brothers, O sire, rushing in wrath<br>towards Bhimasena, encompassed him on all sides. Approaching the son of<br>Kunti they covered him with showers of arrows, like clouds pouring<br>torrents of rain on the mountain-breast in the season of rains. Excited<br>with wrath, those seven great car-warriors began to afflict Bhimasena, O<br>king, like the seven planets afflicting the moon at the hour of the<br>universal dissolution. The son of Kunti, then, O monarch, drawing his<br>beautiful bow with great force and firm grasp, and knowing that his foes<br>were but men, aimed seven shafts. And lord Bhima in great rage sped at<br>them those shafts, effulgent as solar rays. Indeed, Bhimasena<br>recollecting his former wrongs, shot those shafts as if for extracting<br>the life from out of the bodies of those sons of thine. Those arrows, O<br>Bharata, whetted on stone and equipped with wings of gold, shot by<br>Bhimasena, piercing through the bodies of those Bharata princes, flew<br>into the sky. Indeed, those arrows winged with gold, piercing through the<br>hearts of thy sons, looked beautiful, O monarch, as they passed into the<br>sky, like birds of excellent plumage. Decked with gold and covered all<br>over with blood, those arrows, O king, drinking the blood of thy sons<br>passed out of their body. Pierced in their vital limbs by means of those<br>arrows, they fell down on the earth from their cars, like tall trees<br>growing on mountain precipices, broken by an elephant. The seven sons of<br>thine that were thus slain were Satrunjaya, and Satrusaha, and Chitra,<br>and Chitrayudha, and Dridha, and Chitrasena and Vikarna. Amongst all thy<br>sons thus slain, Vrikodara, the son of Pandu, grieved bitterly from<br>sorrow for Vikarna who was dear to him. And Bhima said, 'Even thus was<br>the vow made by me, viz., that all of you should be slain by me in<br>battle. It is for that, O Vikarna, that thou hast been slain. My vow hath<br>been accomplished. O hero, thou camest to battle, bearing in mind the<br>duties of a Kshatriya. Thou wert ever engaged in our good, and especially<br>in that of the king (our eldest brother). It is scarcely proper,<br>therefore, for me to grieve for thy illustrious self.' Having slain those<br>princes, O king, in the very sight of Radha's son, the son of Pandu<br>uttered a terrible leonine roar. That loud shout of the heroic Bhima, O<br>Bharata, informed king Yudhishthira the Just that the victory in that<br>battle was his. Indeed, hearing that tremendous shout of Bhima armed with<br>the bow, king Yudhishthira felt great joy in the midst of that battle.<br>The gladdened son of Pandu, then, O king, received that leonine shout of<br>his brother with sounds and other musical instruments. And after<br>Vrikodara, had sent him that message by the sign agreed upon,<br>Yudhishthira, that foremost of persons acquainted with weapons, filled<br>with joy, rushed against Drona in battle. On the other hand, O king,<br>beholding one and thirty of thy sons slain, Duryodhana recollected the<br>words of Vidura.-Those beneficial words spoken by Vidura are now<br>realised! Thinking even so, king Duryodhana was unable to do what he<br>should. All that, during the match at dice, thy foolish and wicked son,<br>with Karna (on his side), said unto the princes of Panchala causing her<br>to be brought into the assembly, all the harsh words, again, that Karna<br>said unto Krishna, in the same place, before thyself, O king, and the<br>sons of Pandu, in thy hearing and that of all the Kurus, viz., O Krishna,<br>the Pandavas are lost and have sunk into eternal hell, therefore, choose<br>thou other husbands,&#8212;alas, the fruit of all that is now manifesting<br>itself. Then, again, O thou of Kuru's race, diverse harsh speeches, such<br>as sesamum seeds without kernel, etc., were applied by the wrathful sons<br>to those high-souled ones, viz., the sons of Pandu. Bhimasena, vomiting<br>forth the fire of wrath (which these enraged) and which he had restrained<br>for thirteen years, is now compassing the destruction of thy sons.<br>Indulging in copious lamentations, Viduara failed to persuade thee<br>towards peace. O chief of the Bharatas, suffer the fruit of all that with<br>thy sons. Thou art old, patient, and capable of foreseeing the<br>consequences of all acts. Being so, when thou didst yet refuse to follow<br>the counsels of thy well-wishers, it seems that all this is the result of<br>destiny. Do not grieve, O tiger among men! All this is thy great fault.<br>In my opinion, thou art thyself the cause of the destruction of thy sons.<br>O monarch, Vikarna hath fallen, and Chitrasena also of great prowess.<br>Many other mighty car-warriors and foremost ones among thy sons have also<br>fallen. Others, again, among thy sons whom Bhima saw come within the<br>range of his vision, O mighty-armed one, he slew in a trice. It is for<br>thee only that I had to see our array scorched in thousands by means of<br>the arrows shot by Pandu's son, Bhima and Vrisha (Karna)!'"
