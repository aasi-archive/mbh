                            "Sanjaya said, 'In the afternoon of that day, O king, a dreadful battle,<br>characterised by roars, deep as those of the clouds, once more occurred<br>between Drona and the Somakas. That foremost of men, Drona, mounted on<br>his car of red steeds, and intent on battle rushed against the Pandavas,<br>with moderate speed. The valiant son of Bharadwaja, that great bowman<br>endued with mighty strength, that hero born in an excellent pot, engaged<br>in doing what was agreeable to thee, O king, and striking down, O<br>Bharata, many foremost of warriors with his whetted arrows, equipped with<br>beautiful wings, seemed to sport in that battle. Then that mighty<br>car-warrior of the Kaikeyas, Vrihatkshatra, irresistible in battle, and<br>the eldest of five brothers, rushed against him. Shooting many keen<br>shafts, he greatly afflicted the preceptor, like a mighty mass of clouds<br>pouring torrents of rain on the mountain of Gandhamadana. Then Drona, O<br>king, excited with wrath sped at him five and ten shafts whetted on stone<br>and equipped with wings of gold. The prince of the Kekayas, however,<br>cheerfully cut off every one of those shafts shot by Drona, and which<br>resembled angry snakes of virulent poison, with five shafts of his own.<br>Beholding that lightness of hand displayed by him that bull among<br>Brahmanas, then, sped at him eight straight shafts. Seeing those shafts<br>shot from Drona's bow, swiftly coursing towards him, Vrihatkshatra in<br>that battle resisted them with as many sharp shafts of his. Beholding<br>that exceedingly difficult feat achieved by Vrihatkshatra, thy troops, O<br>king, were filled with amazement. Then Drona, O monarch, applauding<br>Vrihatkshatra, invoked into existence the irresistible and celestial<br>weapon called Brahma in that battle. The prince of the Kekayas, seeing it<br>shot by Drona in battle, baffled that Brahma weapon, O monarch, by a<br>Brahma weapon of his own. After that weapon had been thus baffled,<br>Vrihatkshatra, O Bharata, pierced the Brahmana with sixty shafts whetted<br>on stone and equipped with wings of gold. Then Drona, that foremost of<br>men, pierced the prince of the Kekayas with a powerful shaft which,<br>penetrating through the latter's armour, (passed through his body and)<br>entered the earth. As a black cobra, O best of kings, pierces through an<br>ant-hill, even so did that shafts enter the earth, having pierced through<br>the body of the Kekaya prince in that battle. Deeply pierced, O monarch,<br>with the shafts of Drona, the prince of the Kekayas, filled with rage,<br>and rolling his beautiful eyes, pierced Drona with seventy arrows whetted<br>on stone and equipped with wings of gold. And with another arrow he<br>greatly afflicted Drona's charioteer in this very vitals. Pierced by<br>Vrihatkshatra, O sire, with arrows, Drona shot showers of keen shafts at<br>the car of the Prince of the Kekayas. Depriving the mighty car-warrior,<br>Vrihatkshatra, of his coolness, Drona then, with four-winged arrows, slew<br>the four steeds of the former. With another arrow he felled<br>Vrihatkshatra's charioteer from his niche in the car. And felling on the<br>earth, with two other arrows, his enemy's standard and umbrella, that<br>bull among Brahmanas, with a third shaft well-shot from his bow, pierced<br>Vrihatkshatra himself in the chest. Thereupon, the latter, thus struck in<br>the chest, fell down from his car.<br><br>"Upon the slaughter, O king, of Vrihatkshatra, that mighty car-warrior<br>among the Kaikeyas, the son of Sisupala, filled with rage, addressed his<br>charioteer, saying, 'O charioteer, proceed to the spot where Drona<br>stayeth, clad in armour and engaged in slaying the Kaikeya and the<br>Panchala hosts.' Hearing these words of his, the charioteer soon took<br>that foremost of car-warriors unto Drona, by means of those fleet steeds<br>of the Kamvoja breed. Then Dhrishtaketu, that bull among the Chedis,<br>swelling with might, rushed towards Drona for his own destruction like an<br>insect upon a blazing fire. Soon he pierced Drona and his steeds and car<br>and standard with sixty shafts. And once more he struck him with many<br>other keen shafts like a man rousing a sleeping tiger. Then Drona, with a<br>sharp razor-faced arrow winged with vulturine feathers, cut off the<br>middle of the bow of that mighty warrior struggling in battle. Then that<br>powerful car-warrior, viz., the son of Sisupala, taking up another bow,<br>pierced Drona with many shafts winged with the feathers of Kankas and<br>peacocks. Drona then, slaying with four shafts the four steeds of<br>Dhrishtaketu, smilingly cut off the head of the latter's charioteer from<br>his trunk. And then he pierced Dhrishtaketu himself with five and twenty<br>arrows. The prince of the Chedis then, quickly jumping down from his car,<br>took up a mace, and hurled it at the son of Bharadwaja like an angry<br>snake. Beholding that heavy mace, endued with the strength of adamant and<br>decked with gold, coursing towards him like Death, the son of Bharadwaja<br>cut it off with many thousands of whetted arrows. That mace, cut off by<br>Bharadwaja's son, O sire, with many shafts, fell down, O Kaurava, making<br>the earth echo with its noise. Beholding his mace baffled, the wrathful<br>and brave Dhrishtaketu hurled a lance and then a dart decked with gold.<br>Cutting off that lance with five shafts, Drona cut off that dart also<br>with five arrows. Both those missiles, thus cut off, fell down on the<br>earth, like a couple of snakes mangled and torn by Garuda. The valiant<br>son of Bharadwaja then, in that battle, sped for his destruction a keen<br>shaft at Dhrishtaketu who was battling for the destruction of Bharadwaja<br>himself. That shaft, piercing through the armour and breast of<br>Dhrishtaketu of immeasurable energy, entered the earth, like a swan<br>diving into a lake overgrown with lotuses. As a hungry jay seizes and<br>devours a little insect, even so did the heroic Drona swallows up<br>Dhrishtaketu in that great battle. Upon the slaughter of the ruler of the<br>Chedis, his son who was conversant with the highest weapons, excited with<br>wrath, sought to bear the burthen of his sire. Him also, Drona, smiling,<br>despatched to the abode of Yama by means of his shafts, like a huge and<br>mighty tiger in the deep woods slaying an infant deer.<br><br>"While the Pandavas, O Bharata, were thus being thinned, the heroic, son<br>of Jarasandha rushed towards Drona. Like the clouds shrouding the sun, he<br>quickly made the mighty-armed Drona invisible in that battle by means of<br>his arrowy showers. Beholding that lightness of hand in him, Drona, that<br>grinder of Kshatriyas, quickly shot his shafts by hundreds and thousands.<br>Covering (with his arrows) in that battle that foremost of car-warriors<br>stationed on his car, Drona speedily slew the son Of Jarasandha in the<br>very sight of all bowmen. Indeed, Drona, resembling the Destroyer<br>himself, swallowing up every one who approached him then, like the<br>Destroyer himself, swallowing up creatures when their hour arrives. Then<br>Drona, O monarch, proclaiming his name in that battle, covered the<br>Pandavas with many thousands of shafts. Those shafts shot by Drona,<br>whetted on stone and engraved with his name, slew in that battle men and<br>elephants and steeds by hundreds. Thus slaughtered by Drona, like the<br>Asuras by Sakra, the Panchalas began to tremble like a herd of kine<br>afflicted with cold. Indeed, O bull of Bharata's race, when the Pandava<br>army was thus being slaughtered by Drona, there arose an awful wail of<br>woe from it. Scorched by the sun and slaughtered by means of those<br>arrows, the Panchalas then became filled with anxiety. Stupefied by<br>Bharadwaja's son with his arrowy showers in that battle the mighty<br>car-warriors among the Panchalas felt like persons whose thighs had been<br>seized by alligators. Then, O king, the Chedis, the Srinjayas, the Kasis,<br>and the Kosalas, rushed cheerfully against the son of Bharadwaja from<br>desire of battle. And the Chedis, the Panchalas, and the Srinjayas<br>addressed one another, saying, 'Drona is slain! Drona is slain!' Saying<br>these words, they rushed at that hero. Indeed, all these tigers among men<br>fell with their utmost might upon the illustrious Drona, desirous of<br>despatching him to the abode of Yama. Then the son of Bharadwaja, by<br>means of his shafts, despatched those brave warriors struggling<br>vigorously in battle, especially those forest ones among the Chedis, into<br>the presence of the King of the dead. After those foremost ones among the<br>Chedis had been exterminated, the Panchalas, afflicted with the shafts of<br>Drona, began to tremble. Beholding, O sire, those feats of Drona, they<br>loudly called after Bhimasena and Dhrishtadyumna, O Bharata, and said,<br>'This Brahmana hath, without doubt, practised the austerest of penances<br>and acquired great ascetic merit. Inflamed with rage in battle, he<br>consumeth the foremost of Kshatriyas. A Kshatriya's duty is battle; a<br>Brahmana's, the highest asceticism. A Brahmana endued with ascetic merit<br>and learning, is capable of burning everything by his glances only. Many<br>foremost of Kshatriyas, having approached the uncrossable and fierce fire<br>of Drona's weapons, have, O Bharata, been blasted and consumed. The<br>illustrious Drona, to the measure of his might, courage, and<br>perseverance, stupefies all creatures and slays our troops!' Hearing<br>these words of theirs, the mighty Kshatradharman, rightly observant of<br>the duties of a Kshatriya, wrathfully cut off with a crescent-shaped<br>arrow the bow of Drona with arrow fixed thereon. Then Drona, that grinder<br>of Kshatriyas, becoming more angry still, took up another bright bow,<br>tougher than the one he had laid aside. Fixing on it a keen arrow,<br>destructive of hostile ranks, the preceptor, endued with great strength,<br>sped it at the prince, drawing the bowstring to his ear. That arrow,<br>slaying Kshatradharman entered the earth. His breast pierced through, he<br>fell down from his vehicle on the earth. Upon the slaughter of<br>Dhrishtadyumna's son, the (Pandava) troops began to tremble. Then the<br>mighty Chekitana fell upon Drona, Piercing Drona with ten arrows, he once<br>more pierced him with a shaft in the centre of his chest. And he pierced<br>Drona's charioteer with four arrows and his four steeds also with four.<br>The Preceptor then pierced the right arm of Chekitana with sixteen<br>arrows, and his standard with sixteen, and his charioteer with seven.<br>Upon the charioteer being slain, Chekitana's steeds fled away, dragging<br>the car after them. Beholding the steeds of Chekitana pierced with the<br>arrows of Bharadwaja's son, and his car also deprived of driver, the<br>Panchalas and the Pandavas were filled with great fear. Drona then, O<br>sire, routing on all sides the Panchalas and the Srinjayas united<br>together in battle looked exceedingly resplendent. The venerable Drona,<br>full five and eighty years of age, dark in hue and with white locks<br>descending to his cars, careered in battle like a youth of sixteen.<br>Indeed, O king, enemies regarded the foe-slaying Drona, as he fearlessly<br>careered in battle, to be none else than Indra himself armed with the<br>thunder. Then, O monarch, the mighty-armed Drupada of great intelligence<br>said, 'This one (Drona) is slaying the Kshatriyas like a hungry tiger<br>slaying smaller animals. The sinful Duryodhana of wicked soul will<br>assuredly obtain the most miserable regions (in the next world). It is<br>through his covetousness that many foremost of the Kshatriyas, slain in<br>battle, lay prostrate on the field, like mangled bulls, weltering in<br>blood and becoming the food of dogs and jackals.' Saying these words, O<br>monarch, Drupada, that master of an Akshauhini of troops, placing the<br>Parthas at his head, rushed with speed towards Drona.'"
