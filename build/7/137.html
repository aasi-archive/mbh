                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'O Suta, O Sanjaya, this grievous result that has<br>now overtaken us is, I think, certainly due to my evil policy. I had<br>hitherto thought that what is past. But, O Sanjaya, what measures should<br>I now adopt? I am now once more calm, O Sanjaya, therefore, tell me how<br>this slaughter of heroes is going on, having my evil policy for its<br>cause.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Indeed, O king, Karna and Bhima, both endued with great<br>prowess, continued in that battle to pour their arrowy showers like two<br>rain-charged clouds. The arrows, winged with gold and whetted on stone<br>and marked with Bhima's name, approaching Karna, penetrated into his<br>body, as if piercing into his very life. Similarly, Bhima also, in that<br>battle was shrouded with the shafts of Karna in hundreds and thousands,<br>resembling snakes of virulent poison. With their arrows, O king, failing<br>on all sides, an agitation was produced among the troops resembling that<br>of the very ocean. Many were the combatants, O chastiser of foes, in thy<br>host that were deprived of life by arrows, resembling snakes of virulent<br>poison shot from Bhima's bow. Strewn with fallen elephants and steeds<br>mixed with the bodies of men, the field of battle looked like one covered<br>with trees broken by a tempest. Slaughtered in battle with the arrows<br>from Bhima's bow, thy warriors fled away, 'saying, What is this?' Indeed,<br>that host of the Sindhus, the Sauviras, and the Kauravas, afflicted with<br>the impetuous shafts of both Karna and Bhima, was removed to a great<br>distance. The remnant of those brave soldiers, with their steeds and<br>elephants killed, leaving the vicinity of both Karna and Bhima, fled away<br>in all directions. (And they cried out), 'Verily, for the sake of the<br>Parthas, the gods are stupefying us, since those arrows shot by both<br>Bhima and Karna are slaying our forces. Saying those words, these troops<br>of thine afflicted with fear avoiding the range of (Karna's and Bhima's)<br>arrows, stood at a distance for witnessing that combat. Then, on the<br>field of battle there began to flow a terrible river enhancing the joy of<br>the heroes and the fears of the timid. And it was caused by the blood of<br>elephants and steeds and men. And covered with the lifeless forms of men<br>and elephants and steeds, with flagstaffs and the bottoms of cars, with<br>the adornments of cars and elephants and steeds with broken cars and<br>wheels and Akshas and Kuveras, with loud-twanged bows decked with gold,<br>and gold-winged arrows and shafts in thousands, shot by Karna and Bhima,<br>resembling snakes just freed from their sloughs, with countless lances<br>and spears and scimitars and battleaxes, with maces and clubs and axes,<br>all adorned with gold, with standards of diverse shapes, and darts and<br>spiked clubs, and with beautiful Sataghnis, the earth, O Bharata, looked<br>resplendent. And strewn all over with earrings and necklaces of gold and<br>bracelets loosened (from wrists), and rings, and precious gems worn on<br>diadems and crowns, and head-gears, and golden ornaments of diverse<br>kinds, O sire, and coats of mail, and leathern fences, and elephants'<br>ropes, and umbrellas displaced (from their places) and Yak-tails, and<br>fans with the pierced bodies of elephants and steeds and men, with<br>blood-dyed arrows, and with diverse other objects, lying about and<br>loosened from their places, the field of battle looked resplendent like<br>the firmament bespangled with stars. Beholding the wonderful,<br>inconceivable, and superhuman feats of those two warriors, the Charanas<br>and the Siddhas were exceedingly amazed. As a blazing conflagration,<br>having the wind for its ally, courses through an (extended) heap of dry<br>grass, even so, Adhiratha's son, engaged with Bhima, coursed fiercely in<br>that battle.[161] Both of them felled countless standards and cars and<br>slew steeds and men and elephants, like a pair of elephants crushing a<br>forest of reeds while engaged in battle with other. Thy host looked like<br>a mass of clouds, O king, of men, and great was the carnage caused in<br>that battle by Karna and Bhima.'"[162]
