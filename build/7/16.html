                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding that army of thine exceedingly broken, the<br>valiant Vrishasena, single-handed, began to protect it, O king,<br>displaying the illusion of his weapons. Shot by Vrishasena in that<br>battle, thousands of arrows coursed in all directions, piercing through<br>men and steeds and cars and elephants. Mighty arrows, of blazing<br>effulgence, shot by him, coursed in thousands, like the rays, O monarch,<br>of the sun, in the summer season. Afflicted and crushed therewith, O<br>king, car-warriors and horse-men, suddenly fell down on the earth, like<br>trees broken by the wind. The mighty car-warrior Vrishasena, O king,<br>felled large bodies of steeds, of cars and of elephants, in that battle,<br>by thousands. Beholding that single warrior coursing fearlessly on the<br>field, all the kings (of the Pandava army) uniting together, surrounded<br>him on all sides. Nakula's son, Satanika, rushed at Vrishasena and<br>pierced him with ten arrows capable of penetrating into the vitals. The<br>son of Karna, however, cutting off his bow, felled then his standard.<br>Thereupon, the other sons of Draupadi, desirous of rescuing that brother<br>of theirs, rushed at him. And soon they made Karna's son invisible by<br>means of their arrowy showers. Against them thus smiting (the son of<br>Karna), many car-warriors headed by Drona's son (Aswatthama) rushed. And<br>those, O monarch, quickly covered those mighty car-warriors, viz., the<br>sons of Draupadi, with diverse kinds of arrows like clouds pouring rain<br>on mountain breasts. Thereupon, the Pandavas, from affection for their<br>sons, quickly encountered those assailants. The battle then that took<br>place between thy troops and those of the Pandavas, was exceedingly<br>fierce and made the hairs stand on their ends, resembling as it did that<br>between the Gods and the Danavas. Even thus did the heroic Kauravas and<br>the Pandavas, excited with rage, fight, eyeing one another (furiously)<br>and having incurred one another's animosity for past offences. The bodies<br>of those heroes of immeasurable energy then seemed, in consequence of<br>(the) wrath (that inspired them), to resemble those of Garuda and<br>(mighty) Nagas battling in the sky. And with Bhima and Karna and Kripa<br>and Drona and Drona's son and Prishata's son and Satyaki, the field of<br>battle looked resplendent like the all-destructive sun that rises at the<br>end of the Yuga. The battle that took place between those mighty men<br>engaged with mighty antagonists and all smiting one another was fierce in<br>the extreme, resembling that (of yore) between the Danavas and the gods.<br>Then Yudhishthira's host, uttering a shout, loud as that of the surging<br>sea, began to slaughter thy troops, the great car-warriors of thy army<br>having fled away. Beholding the (Kaurava) host broken and excessively<br>mangled by the foe, Drona said, 'Ye heroes, ye need not fly away.' Then<br>he (Drona) owning red steeds, excited with wrath and resembling a<br>(fierce) elephant with four tusks, penetrated into the Pandava host and<br>rushed against Yudhishthira. Then Yudhishthira pierced the preceptor with<br>many whetted arrows equipped with Kanka feathers; Drona, however, cutting<br>off Yudhishthira's bow, rushed impetuously at him. Then the protector of<br>Yudhishthira's car-wheels, Kumara, the renowned prince of the Panchalas,<br>received the advancing Drona, like the continent receiving the surging<br>sea. Beholding Drona, that bull among Brahmanas, held in check by Kumara,<br>loud leonine shouts were heard there with cries of 'Excellent,<br>Excellent!' Kumara then, in that great battle, excited with rage, pierced<br>Drona with an arrow in the chest and uttered many leonine shouts. Having<br>checked Drona in battle, the mighty Kumara, endued with great lightness<br>of hand, and above all fatigue, pierced him with many thousands of<br>arrows. Then that bull among men (Drona) slew that protector of<br>Yudhishthira's car-wheels, Kumara, that hero observant of virtuous vows<br>and accomplished in both mantras and weapons. And then penetrating into<br>the midst of the (Pandava) host and careering in all directions, that<br>bull among men, Bharadwaja's son, became the protector of thy troops. And<br>piercing Sikhandin with twelve arrows, and Uttamaujas with twenty, and<br>Nakula with five, and Sahadeva with seven, and Yudhishthira with twelve,<br>and each of the (five) sons of Draupadi with three, and Satyaki with<br>five, and the ruler of Matsyas with ten arrows, and agitating the entire<br>host in that battle, he rushed against one after another of the foremost<br>warriors (of the Pandavas). And then he advanced against Kunti's son,<br>Yudhisthira, from a desire of seizing him. Then Yugandhara, O king,<br>checked Bharadwaja's son, that mighty car-warrior, filled with rage and<br>resembling the very ocean lashed into fury by the tempest. Bharadwaja's<br>son, however, having pierced Yudhishthira with many straight arrows,<br>felled Yugandhara with a broad-headed shaft from his niche in the car.<br>Then, Virata and Drupada, and the Kaikeya princes, and Satyaki, and Sivi,<br>and Vyaghradatta, the prince n the Panchalas, and the valiant Singhasena,<br>these, and many others, desirous of rescuing Yudhishthira, surrounded<br>Drona on all sides and impeded his way, scattering countless arrows.<br>Vyaghradatta, the prince of the Panchalas, pierced Drona with fifty<br>keen-pointed arrows, at which, O king, the troops uttered loud shouts.<br>Then Singhasena also, quickly piercing that mighty car-warrior, Drona,<br>roared aloud in joy, striking terror into the hearts of mighty<br>car-warriors; Drona then expanding his eyes and rubbing his bowstring and<br>producing loud sound of slaps by his palms, rushed against the latter.<br>Then the mighty son of Bharadwaja, putting forth his prowess, cut off<br>with a couple of broad-headed arrows the heads decked with earrings from<br>the trunks of both Singhasena and Vyaghradatta. And afflicting also, with<br>his arrowy showers, the other mighty car-warriors of the Pandavas, he<br>stood in front of Yudhishthira's car, like all-destroying Death himself.<br>Then, O king, loud cries were heard among the warriors of Yudhishthira's<br>army to the effect, 'The king is slain,' when Bharadwaja's son, of<br>regulated vows, thus, stood in his vicinity. And the warriors there all<br>exclaimed, beholding Drona's prowess, 'Today the royal son of<br>Dhritarashtra will be crowned with success. This very moment Drona having<br>seized Yudhishthira, will, filled, with joy, assuredly come to us and<br>Duryodhana's presence. While thy soldiers were indulging in such talks,<br>Kunti's son (Arjuna) quickly came there, filling (the welkin) with the<br>rattle of his car, and creating, as he came, owing to the carnage he<br>caused, a river whose waters were blood, and whose eddies were cars, and<br>which abounded with the bones and bodies of brave warriors and which bore<br>creatures away to where the spirits of the departed dwell. And the son of<br>Pandu came there, routing the Kurus, and quickly crossing that river<br>whose froth was constituted by showers of arrows and which abounded with<br>fish in the form of lances and other weapons. And the diadem-decked<br>(Arjuna) suddenly came upon Drona's divisions, covering it with a thick<br>net-work of arrows and confounding the very sense (of those that followed<br>Drona). Incessantly placing his arrows on the bow-string and quickly<br>shooting them, none could notice any lapse of time between these two acts<br>of the renowned son of Kunti. Neither (four cardinal) directions, nor the<br>firmament above, nor the earth, O king, could any longer be<br>distinguished, for everything then became one dense mass of arrows.<br>Indeed, O king, when the wielder of Gandiva caused that thick darkness by<br>means of his arrows, nothing could be seen in that battle. Just then the<br>sun also set, enveloped with a dusty cloud. Neither friend nor foe could<br>any longer be distinguished. Then Drona and Duryodhana and others caused<br>the withdrawal of their troops. And ascertaining the foe to be inspired<br>with fear and unwilling to continue the fight, Vibhatsu also slowly<br>caused his troops to be withdrawn. Then the Pandavas and the Srinjayas<br>and the Panchalas, filled with joy, praised Partha with delightful<br>speeches like the Rishis praising the Sun. Having vanquished his foes<br>thus, Dhananjaya then, filled with joy, retired to his tent, proceeding<br>in the rear of the whole army, with Kesava as his companion. And<br>stationed on his beautiful car decked with the costliest specimens of<br>sapphires and rubies and gold and silver and diamonds and corals and<br>crystals, the son of Pandu looked resplendent like the moon in the<br>firmament bespangled with stars.'"
