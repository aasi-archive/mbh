                            "Sanjaya said, 'Held in check by them, that foremost of car-warriors,<br>viz., Partha of great might and prowess, was quickly pursued by Drona<br>from behind. The son of Pandu, however, like diseases scorching the body,<br>blasted that army, scattering his sharp shafts and resembling on that<br>account the sun himself scattering his countless rays of light. And<br>steeds were pierced, and cars with riders were broken and mangled, and<br>elephants were overthrown. And umbrellas were cut off and displaced, and<br>vehicles were deprived of their wheels. And the combatants fled on all<br>sides, exceedingly afflicted with arrows. Even thus progressed that<br>fierce battle between those warriors and Arjuna encountering each other.<br>Nothing could be distinguished. With his straight shafts, Arjuna, O<br>monarch, made the hostile army tremble incessantly. Firmly devoted to<br>truth, Arjuna then, of white steeds desirous of accomplishing his vow<br>rushed against the foremost of car-warriors, viz., Drona of red steeds.<br>Then the preceptor, Drona, struck his disciple, viz., the mighty bowman<br>Arjuna, with five and twenty straight shafts capable of reaching the very<br>vitals. Thereupon, Vibhatsu, that foremost of all wielders of weapons,<br>quickly rushed against Drona, shooting arrows capable of baffling the<br>force of counter arrows, shot at him. Invoking into existence then the<br>Brahma weapon, Arjuna, of immeasurable soul, baffled with his straight<br>shafts those shot so speedily at him by Drona. The skill we then beheld<br>of Drona was exceedingly wonderful, since Arjuna, though young, and<br>though struggling vigorously, could not pierce Drona with a single shaft.<br>Like a mass of clouds pouring torrents of rain, the Drona cloud rained<br>shower on the Partha-mountain. Possessed of great energy, Arjuna received<br>that arrowy downpour, O king, by invoking the Brahma weapon, and cut off<br>all those arrows by arrows of his own. Drona then afflicted Partha of<br>white steeds with five and twenty arrows. And he struck Vasudeva with<br>seventy arrows on the chest and arms. Partha then, of great intelligence,<br>smiling the while resisted the preceptor in that battle who was<br>incessantly shooting sharp arrows. Then those two foremost of<br>car-warriors, while thus struck by Drona, avoided that invincible<br>warrior, who resembled the raging Yuga fire. Avoiding those sharp shafts<br>shot from Drona's bow, the diadem-decked son of Kunti, adorned with<br>garlands of flowers, began to slaughter the host of the Bhojas. Indeed,<br>avoiding the invincible Drona who stood immovable like the Mainaka<br>mountain, Arjuna took up his position between Kritavarman and Sudakshina<br>the ruler of the Kamvojas. Then that tiger among men, viz., the ruler of<br>the Bhojas, coolly pierced that invincible and foremost descendant of<br>Ruru with ten arrows winged with Kanka feathers. Then Arjuna pierced him,<br>O monarch, in that battle with a hundred arrows. And once more he pierced<br>him with three other arrows, stupefying that hero of the Satwata race.<br>The ruler of the Bhojas then, laughing the while, pierced Partha and<br>Vasudeva each with five and twenty arrows. Arjuna then, cutting off<br>Kritavarman's bow, pierced him with one and twenty arrows resembling<br>blazing flames of fire or angry snakes of virulent poison. Then<br>Kritavarman, that mighty car-warrior, taking up another bow, pierced<br>Arjuna in the chest, O Bharata, with five arrows. And once more he<br>pierced Partha with five sharp arrows. Then Partha struck him in return<br>in the centre of the chest with nine arrows. Beholding the son of Kunti<br>obstructed before the car of Kritavarman, he of Vrishni's race thought<br>that no time should be wasted. Then Krishna addressing Partha, said, Do<br>not show any mercy to Kritavarman! Disregarding thy relationship (with<br>him), crush and slay him!' Then Arjuna, stupefying Kritavarman with his<br>arrows, proceeded, on his swift steeds, to the division of the Kamvojas.<br>Seeing Arjuna of white steeds penetrate into the Kamvoja force,<br>Kritavarman became filled with wrath. Taking his bow with arrows fixed<br>thereon, he then encountered the two Panchala princes. Indeed,<br>Kritavarman, with his arrows resisted those two Panchala princes as they<br>advanced, following Arjuna for protecting his wheels. Then Kritavarman,<br>the ruler of the Bhojas, pierced them both with sharp shafts, striking<br>Yudhamanyu with three, and Uttamaujas with four. Those two princes in<br>return each pierced him with ten arrows. And once more, Yudhamanyu<br>shooting three arrows and Uttamaujas shooting three cut off Kritavarman's<br>standard and bow. Then the son of Hridika, taking up another bow, and<br>becoming infuriated with rage, deprived both those warriors of their bows<br>and covered them with arrows. Then those two warriors, taking up and<br>stringing two other bows, began to pierce Kritavarman. Meanwhile Vibhatsu<br>penetrated into the hostile army. But those two princes, resisted by<br>Kritavarman, obtained no admittance into the Dhritarashtra host, although<br>those bulls among men struggled vigorously. Then Arjuna of white steeds<br>quickly afflicted in that battle the divisions opposed to him. That<br>slayer of foes, however, slew not Kritavarman although he had got him<br>within reach.. Beholding Partha thus proceeding, the brave king<br>Srutayudha, filled with wrath, rushed at him, shaking his large bow. And<br>he pierced Partha with three arrows, and Janardana with seventy. And he<br>struck the standard of Partha with a very sharp arrow having a razor-like<br>head. Then Arjuna, filled with wrath deeply pierced his antagonist with<br>ninety straight shafts, like (a rider) striking a mighty elephant with<br>the hook. Srutayudha, however, could not, O king, brook that act of<br>prowess on the part of Pandu's son. He pierced Arjuna in return with<br>seven and seventy shafts. Arjuna then cut off Srutayudha's bow and then<br>his quiver, and angrily struck him on the chest with seven straight<br>shafts. Then, king Srutayudha, deprived of his senses by wrath, took up<br>another bow and struck the son of Vasava with nine arrows on the latter's<br>arms and chest. Then Arjuna, that chastiser of foes laughing the while, O<br>Bharata, afflicted Srutayudha with many thousands of arrows. And that<br>mighty car-warrior quickly slew also the latter's steeds and charioteer.<br>Endued with great strength the son of Pandu then pierced his foe with<br>seventy arrows. Then the valiant king Srutayudha abandoning that<br>steedless car, rushed in that encounter against Partha, uplifting his<br>mace. The heroic king Srutayudha was the son of Varuna, having for his<br>mother that mighty river of cool water called Parnasa. His mother, O<br>king, had for the sake of her son, begged Varuna saying, 'Let this my son<br>become unslayable on earth.' Varuna, gratified (with her), had said, 'I<br>give him a boon highly beneficial to him, viz., a celestial weapon, by<br>virtue of which this thy son will become unslayable on earth by foes. No<br>man can have immortality. O foremost of rivers, every one who hath taken<br>birth must inevitably die. This child, however, will always be invincible<br>by foes in battle, through the power of this weapon. Therefore, let thy<br>heart's fever be dispelled.' Having said these words, Varuna gave him,<br>with mantras, a mace. Obtaining that mace, Srutayudha became invincible<br>on earth. Unto him, however, illustrious Lord of the waters again said,<br>'This mace should not be hurled at one who is not engaged in fight. If<br>hurled at such a person, it will come back and fall upon thyself. O<br>illustrious child, (if so hurled) it will then course in an opposite<br>direction and slay the person hurling it.' It would seem that when his<br>hour came, Srutayudha disobeyed that injunction. With that hero-slaying<br>mace he attacked Janardana, The valiant Krishna received that mace on one<br>of his well-formed and stout shoulders. It failed to shake Sauri, like<br>the wind failing to shake the Vindhya mountain. That mace, returning unto<br>Srutayudha himself, struck that brave and wrathful king staying on his<br>car, like an ill-accomplished act of sorcery injuring the performer<br>himself, and slaying that hero fell down on the earth. Beholding the mace<br>turn back and Srutayudha slain, loud cries of Alas and Oh arose there<br>among the troops, at the sight of Srutayudha that chastiser of foes,<br>slain by a weapon of his own.[137] And because, O monarch, Srutayudha had<br>hurled that mace at Janardana who was not engaged in fighting it slew him<br>who had hurled it. And Srutayudha perished on the field, even in the<br>manner that Varuna had indicated. Deprived of life, he fell down on the<br>earth before the eyes of all the bowmen. While falling down, that dear<br>son of Parnasa shone resplendent like a tall banian with spreading boughs<br>broken by the wind. Then all the troops and even all the principal<br>warriors fled away, beholding Srutayudha, that chastiser of foes, slain.<br>Then, the son of the ruler of the Kamvojas, viz., the brave Sudakshina,<br>rushed on his swift steeds against Phalguna that slayer of foes. Partha,<br>then, O Bharata, sped seven shafts at him. Those shafts passing through<br>the body of that hero, entered the earth. Deeply pierced those shafts<br>sped in battle from Gandiva, Sudakshina pierced Arjuna in return with ten<br>shafts winged with Kanka feathers. And piercing Vasudeva with three<br>shafts, he once more pierced Partha with five. Then, O sire, Partha,<br>cutting off Sudakshina's bow, lopped off the latter's standard. And the<br>son of Pandu pierced his antagonist with a couple of broad-headed arrows<br>of great sharpness. Sudakshina, however, piercing Partha once more with<br>three arrows, uttered a leonine shout. Then the brave Sudakshina, filled<br>with wrath, hurled at the wielder of Gandiva a terrible dart made wholly<br>of iron and decked with bells. That dart blazing as a large meteor, and<br>emitting sparks of fire, approaching that mighty car-warrior pierced him<br>through and fell down on the earth. Deeply struck by that dart and<br>overcome with a swoon, Arjuna soon enough recovered. Then that hero of<br>mighty energy, licking the corners of his mouth, that son of Pandu, of<br>inconceivable feats, pierced his foe, along with his steeds, standard,<br>bow, and charioteer, with four and ten shafts winged with Kanka feathers.<br>With other arrows, countless in number, Partha then cut Sudakshina's car<br>into fragments. And then the son of Pandu pierced Sudakshina, the prince<br>of the Kamvojas, whose purpose and prowess had both been baffled, with a<br>sharp arrow in the chest. Then the brave prince of the Kamvojas, his coat<br>of mail cut off, his limbs weakened, his diadem and Angadas displaced,<br>fell head downwards, like a pole of Indra when hurled from an engine.<br>Like a beautiful Karnikara tree in the spring, gracefully growing on a<br>mountain summit with beautiful branches, lying on the earth when uprooted<br>by the wind, the prince of the Kamvojas lay on the bare ground deprived<br>of life, though deserving of the costliest bed, decked with costly<br>ornaments. Handsome, possessed of eyes that were of a coppery hue, and<br>bearing on his head a garland of gold, endued with the effulgence of<br>fire, the mighty-armed Sudakshina, the son of the ruler of the Kamvojas,<br>overthrown by Partha with his shafts, and lying on the earth, reft of<br>fife, looked resplendent like a beautiful mountain with a level top. Then<br>all the troops of thy son fled away, beholding Srutayudha, and Sudakshina<br>the prince of the Kamvojas, slain.'"
