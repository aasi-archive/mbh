                            "Narada said, 'Dushmanta's son, Bharata, O Srinjaya, we hear, fell a prey<br>to death. While only a child (living) in the forest, he achieved feats<br>incapable of being achieved by others. Endued with great strength, he<br>speedily deprived the very lions, white as snow and armed with teeth and<br>claws, of all their prowess, and dragged them and bound them (at his<br>pleasure). He used to check tigers also, that were fiercer and more<br>ruthless (than lions), and bring them to subjection. Seizing other beasts<br>of prey possessed of great might, and even huge elephants, dyed with red<br>arsenic and spotted with other liquid minerals by their teeth and tusks,<br>he used to bring them to subjection, causing their mouths to become dry,<br>or obliging them to fly away. Possessed of great might, he used also to<br>drag the mightiest of buffaloes. And in consequence of his strength, he<br>checked proud lions by hundreds, and powerful Srimaras and horned<br>rhinoceroses and other animals. Binding them by their necks and crushing<br>them to an inch of their lives, he used to let them go. For those feats<br>of his the regenerate ascetics (with whom he lived) came to call him<br>Sarvadamana (the controller of all). His mother, at last, forbade him<br>from torturing animals in that way. Endued with great prowess he<br>performed a hundred Horse-sacrifices on the banks of the Yamuna, three<br>hundred such sacrifices on the banks of Saraswati, and four hundred on<br>the banks of the Ganga. Having performed these sacrifices, he once more<br>performed a thousand Horse-sacrifices and a hundred Rajasuyas, great<br>sacrifices, in which his gifts also to the Brahmanas were very profuse.<br>Other sacrifices, again, such as the Agnishtoma, the Atiratra, the Uktha<br>and the Viswajit, he performed together with thousands and thousands of<br>Vajapeyas, and completed without any impediment. The son of Sakuntala,<br>having performed all these, gratified the Brahmanas with presents of<br>wealth. Possessed of great fame, Bharata then gave ten thousand billions<br>of coins, made of the most pure gold, unto Kanwa (who had brought up his<br>mother Sakuntala as his own daughter). The gods with Indra at their head,<br>accompanied by the Brahmanas, coming to his sacrifice, set up his<br>sacrificial stake made entirely of gold, and measuring in width a hundred<br>Vyamas.[114] And imperial Bharata, of noble soul, that victor over all<br>foes, that monarch never conquered by any enemy, gave away unto the<br>Brahmanas beautiful horses and elephants and cars, decked with gold, and<br>beautiful gems of all kinds, and camels and goats and sheep, and<br>slaves&#8212;male and female&#8212;and wealth, and grains and milch cows with<br>calves, and villages and fields, and diverse kinds of robes, numbering by<br>millions and millions. When he died, O Srinjaya, who was superior to thee<br>in respect of the four cardinal virtues and who superior to thee, was,<br>therefore, much superior to thy son, thou shouldst not, saying, 'Oh,<br>Swaitya, Oh, Swaitya,' grieve for the latter who performed no sacrifice<br>and made no sacrificial present.'
