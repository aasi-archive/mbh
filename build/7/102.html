                            "Sanjaya said, 'Saying these words, king Duryodhana pierced Arjuna with<br>three shafts of great impetuosity and capable of penetrating into the<br>very vitals. And with four others he pierced the four steeds of his foe.<br>And he pierced Vasudeva in the centre of the chest with ten shafts, and<br>cutting off, with a broad-headed arrow, the whip in the latter's hands,<br>he felled it on the ground. Then Partha, coolly and without losing a<br>moment, shot at him four and ten shafts whetted on stone and equipped<br>with beautiful feathers. All those shafts, however, were repelled by<br>Duryodhana's armour. Beholding their fruitlessness, Partha once more sped<br>at him nine and five arrows of keen points. But these too were repelled<br>by Duryodhana's armour. Seeing eight and twenty arrows of his become<br>abortive, that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., Krishna said unto Arjuna,<br>these words: 'I see a sight never before witnessed by me, like the<br>movements of the hills. Shafts sped by thee, O Partha, are becoming<br>abortive. O bull of Bharata's race, hath thy Gandiva decayed in power?<br>Have the might of thy grasp and the power of thy arms become less than<br>what they were. Is not this to be thy last meeting with Duryodhana? Tell<br>me, O Partha, for I ask thee. Great hath been my amazement, O Partha,<br>upon seeing all these shafts of thine fall towards Duryodhana's car,<br>without producing the slightest effect. Alas, what misfortune is this<br>that these terrible shafts of thine that are endued with the might of the<br>thunder and that always pierce the bodies of foes, fail in producing any<br>effect.'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'I think, O Krishna, that this armour hath been put on<br>Duryodhana's body by Drona. This armour, tied as it hath been, is<br>impenetrable to my weapons. In this armour, O Krishna, inhereth the might<br>of the three worlds. Only Drona knoweth it, and from that best of men I<br>also have learnt. This armour is not capable of being pierced by my<br>weapons. Maghavat himself, O Govinda, cannot pierce it with his thunder.<br>Knowing it all, O Krishna, why seekest thou to confound me? That which<br>occurred in the three worlds, that which, O Kesava, exists now, and which<br>is in the womb of futurity, are all known to thee. Indeed, O slayer of<br>Madhu, no one else knoweth this better than thou dost. This Duryodhana, O<br>Krishna, cased by Drona in this armours, is staying fearlessly in battle,<br>wearing this coat of mail. That however, which one wearing such armour<br>should do, is not known to him, O Madhava! He weareth it only like a<br>woman. Behold now, O Janardana, the might of my arms and that of my bow<br>too. Though protected by such a coat of mail, I will still vanquish the<br>Kuru prince. The chief of the celestials gave this effulgent armour to<br>Angiras. From the latter it was obtained by Vrihaspati. And from<br>Vrihaspati it was got by Purandara. The Lord of the celestials once more<br>gave it to me with the mantras to be uttered in wearing it. Even if this<br>armour were divine, if it were created by Brahma himself, still the<br>wretch, Duryodhana, struck with my arrows, shall not be protected by it.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Having said these words, Arjuna inspired some arrows<br>with mantras, and began to draw them on the bow-string. And while he was<br>thus drawing them on the bow-string, the son of Drona cut them off with a<br>weapon that was capable of baffling every weapon. Beholding those shafts<br>of his thus frustrated from a distance by that utterer of Brahma<br>(Aswatthaman), Arjuna, owning white steeds, filled with amazement<br>represented unto Kesava, saying, 'I cannot, Janardana, twice use this<br>weapon, for if do so, it will slay my own self and my own troops.<br>Meanwhile, Duryodhana, O king, pierced each of the Krishnas in that<br>battle with nine shafts resembling snakes of virulent poison. And once<br>more the Kuru king showered his shafts on Krishna and the son of Pandu.<br>Beholding these showers of arrows (shot by their king), thy warriors were<br>filled with joy. They beat their musical instrument and uttered leonine<br>roar. Then Partha, excited with rage in that battle, licked the corners<br>of his mouth. Casting his eyes on his enemy's body, he saw not any part<br>that was not well-covered with that impenetrable armour. With some<br>sharp-pointed shafts then, well-shot from his bow, and each of which<br>resembled Death himself, Arjuna slew his antagonist's steeds and then his<br>two Parshni charioteers. And soon also the valiant Partha cut off<br>Duryodhana's bow and the leathern fence of his fingers. Then, Savyasachin<br>commenced to cut off his enemy's car in fragments. And with a couple of<br>keen arrows he made Duryodhana carless. And then Arjuna pierced both the<br>palms of the Kuru king. Beholding that great bowman afflicted with the<br>shafts of Dhananjaya and fallen into great distress, many warriors rushed<br>to the spot, desirous of rescuing him. These, with many thousands of<br>cars, well-equipped elephants and horses, as also with large bodies of<br>foot-soldiers, excited with wrath, encompassed by large bodies of men,<br>neither that car of theirs nor of Arjuna and Govinda could any longer be<br>seen. Then Arjuna, by the might of his weapons, began to slaughter that<br>host. And car-warriors and elephants, by hundreds, deprived of limbs,<br>fell fast on the field. Slain, or in the act of being slain, those failed<br>to reach the excellent car. Indeed, the car on which Arjuna rode, stood<br>motionless full two miles from the besieging force on every side. Then<br>the Vrishni hero (Krishna), without taking any time, said unto Arjuna<br>these words: Draw thy bow quickly and with great force, for I will blow<br>my conch.' Thus addressed, Arjuna drawing his bow Gandiva with great<br>force, began to slaughter the foe, shooting dense showers of shafts and<br>making a loud noise by stretching the bowstring with his fingers. Kesava<br>meanwhile forcibly and very loudly blew his conch Panchajanya, his face<br>covered with dust. In consequence of the blare of that conch and of the<br>twang of Gandiva, the Kuru warriors, strong or weak, all fell down on the<br>ground. The car of Arjuna then freed from that press, looked resplendent<br>like a cloud driven by the wind. (Beholding Arjuna) the protectors of<br>Jayadratha, with their followers, became filled with rage. Indeed, those<br>mighty bowmen, the protectors of the ruler of Sindhus, suddenly beholding<br>Partha, uttered loud shouts, filling the earth with that noise. The whiz<br>of their arrows were mingled with other fierce noises and the loud blare<br>of their conchs. Those high-souled warriors uttered leonine shouts.<br>Hearing that awful uproar raised by thy troops, Vasudeva and Dhananjaya<br>blew their conchs. With their loud blare (of their conchs), the whole<br>earth, with her mountains and seas and islands and the nether regions, O<br>monarch, seemed to be filled. Indeed, that blare, O best of Bharatas,<br>filled all the points of the compass, and was echoed back by both the<br>armies. Then thy car-warriors, beholding Krishna and Dhananjaya, became<br>very much frightened. Soon, however, they recovered and put forth their<br>activity. Indeed, the great car-warriors of thy host, beholding the two<br>Krishnas, those highly blessed persons, cased in mail rushed towards. The<br>sight thus presented became a wonderful one.'"
