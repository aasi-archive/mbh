                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then the younger brother of Karna, uttering loud roars,<br>bow in hand, and repeatedly stretching the bow-string, quickly placed<br>himself between those two illustrious warriors. And Karna's brother, with<br>ten shafts, pierced invincible Abhimanyu and his umbrella and standard<br>and charioteer and steeds, smiling the while. Beholding Abhimanyu thus<br>afflicted with those arrows, although he had achieved those superhuman<br>feats in the manner of his sire and grandsire, the warriors of thy army<br>were filled with delight. Then Abhimanyu, forcibly bending the bow and<br>smiling the while, with one winged arrow cut off his antagonist's head.<br>That head, severed from the trunk, fell down on the earth. Beholding his<br>brother slain and overthrown, like a Karnikara tree shaken and thrown<br>down by the wind from the mountain top, Karna, O monarch, was filled with<br>pain. Meanwhile, the son of Subhadra, causing Karna by means of his<br>arrows to turn away from the field, quickly rushed against the other<br>great bowmen. Then Abhimanyu of fierce energy and great fame, filled with<br>wrath, broke that host of diverse forces abounding with elephants and<br>steeds and cars and infantry. As regards Karna, afflicted by Abhimanyu<br>with countless shafts, he fled away from the field borne by swift steeds.<br>The Kaurava array then broke. When the welkin was covered with<br>Abhimanyu's shafts, like flights of locusts or thick showers of rain,<br>nothing, O monarch, could be distinguished. Amongst thy warriors thus<br>slaughtered by Abhimanyu with sharp shafts, none, O monarch, stayed any<br>longer on the field of battle except the ruler of the Sindhus. Then that<br>bull among men, viz., the son of Subhadra, blowing his conch, speedily,<br>fell upon the Bharata host, O bull of Bharata's race! Like a burning<br>brand thrown into the midst of dry grass, Arjuna's son began to consume<br>his foes, quickly careering through the Kaurava army. Having pierced<br>through their array, he mangled cars and elephants and steeds and human<br>beings by means of his sharp shafts and caused the field of battle teem<br>with headless trunks. Cut off by means of excellent arrows shot from the<br>bow of Subhadra's son, the Kaurava warriors fled away, slaying, as they<br>fled, their own comrades before them. Those fierce arrows, of terrible<br>effect whetted on stone and, countless in number, slaying car-warriors<br>and elephants, steeds, fell fast on the field. Arms, decked with Angadas<br>and other ornaments of gold, cut off and hands cased in leathern covers,<br>and arrows, and bows, and bodies and heads decked with car-rings and<br>floral wreaths, lay in thousands on the field. Obstructed with Upashkaras<br>and Adhishthanas and long poles also with crushed Akshas and broken<br>wheels and yokes, numbering thousands, With darts and bows and swords and<br>fallen standards, and with shields and bows lying all about, with the<br>bodies, O monarch, of slain Kshatriyas and steeds and elephants, the<br>field of battle, looking exceedingly fierce, soon became impassable. The<br>noise made by the princes, as they called upon One another while<br>slaughtered by Abhimanyu, became deafening and enhanced the fears of the<br>timid. That noise, O chief of the Bharatas, filled all the points of the<br>compass. The son of Subhadra, rushed against the (Kaurava) troops,<br>slaying foremost of car-warriors and steeds and elephants, Quickly<br>consuming his foes, like a fire playing in the midst of a heap of dry<br>grass, the son of Arjuna was seen careering through the midst of the<br>Bharata army. Encompassed as he was by our troops and covered with dust,<br>none of us could obtain a sight of that warrior when, O Bharata, he was<br>careening over the field in all directions, cardinal and subsidiary. And<br>he took the lives of steeds and elephants and human warriors, O Bharata,<br>almost incessantly. And soon after we saw him (come out of the press).<br>Indeed, O monarch, we beheld him then scorching his foes like the<br>meridian sun (scorching everything with his rays). Equal to Vasava<br>himself in battle, that son of Vasava's son viz., Abhimanyu, looked<br>resplendent in the midst of the (hostile) army.'"
