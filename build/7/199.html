                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'That illustrious person who had duly studied the<br>Vedas with all their branches, he, in whom the entire science of arms and<br>modesty had dwelt, he through whose grace many foremost of men are still<br>capable of achieving superhuman feats which the very gods cannot achieve<br>with care, alas, when he, viz., that Drona, that son of a great Rishi was<br>insulted in the sight of all by the low, wicked, mean minded and sinful<br>Dhrishtadyumna, that slayer of his own preceptor, was there no Kshatriya<br>who felt called upon to display his wrath? Fie on the Kshatriya order,<br>and fie on wrath itself! Tell me, O Sanjaya, what the sons of Pritha, as<br>also all the other royal bowmen in the world, hearing of Drona's<br>slaughter, said unto the prince of Panchala.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Hearing these words of Drupada's son, of crooked deeds,<br>all the persons present there, O monarch, remained perfectly silent.<br>Arjuna, however, casting oblique glances upon Prishata's son, seemed,<br>with tears and sighs, to reproach him, saying, 'Fie, fie.' Yudhishthira<br>and Bhima and the twins and Krishna and the others stood bashfully.<br>Satyaki, however, O king, said these words, 'Is there no man here that<br>would, without delay, slay this sinful wight, this lowest of men, who is<br>uttering such evil speeches? The Pandavas are all condemning thee for<br>this sinful act of thine, like Brahmanas condemning a person of the<br>Chandala class. Having committed such a heinous act, having incurred the<br>censures of all honest men, art thou not ashamed to open thy lips in the<br>midst of such a respectable assembly? O despicable wretch, why did not<br>thy tongue and head split into a hundred fragments while thou wert about<br>to slay thy own preceptor? Why wert thou not struck down by that act of<br>sin? Since, having perpetrated such a sinful act, again applauding<br>thyself in the midst of human beings, thou incurrest the censures of the<br>Parthas and all the Andhakas and the Vrishnis. Having perpetrated such an<br>atrocious act, thou art again displaying such hatred towards the<br>preceptor. For this thou deservest death at our hands. There is no use in<br>keeping thee alive for even a single moment. Who is there, save thee, O<br>wretch, that would cause the death of the virtuous preceptor, seizing him<br>by his locks? Having obtained thee, O wretch, thy ancestors, for seven<br>generations and thy descendants also for seven generations, deprived of<br>fame, have sunk into hell, Thou hast charged Partha, that bull among men,<br>with the slaughter of Bhishma. The latter, however, viz., that<br>illustrious personage, himself accomplished his own death. Truly<br>speaking, the uterine brother, (viz., Sikhandin), that foremost of all<br>sinners, was the cause of Bhishma's death. There is none in the world<br>that is more sinful than the sons of the Panchala king. Thy father had<br>created Sikhandin for the destruction of Bhishma. As regards Arjuna, he<br>had only, protected Sikhandin while Sikhandin became the cause of the<br>illustrious Bhishma's death. Having got thee that is condemned by all<br>righteous men, and thy brother, amongst them, the Panchalas have fallen<br>off from righteousness, and stained with meanness, have become haters of<br>friends and preceptors. If thou again speakest such words in my presence,<br>I shall then break with this mace of mine that is as strong as the<br>thunderbolt. Beholding thee that art the slayer of a Brahmana, since thou<br>art guilty of nothing less than the slaughter of a Brahmana., people have<br>to look at the sun for purifying themselves. Thou wretch of a Panchala, O<br>thou of wicked conduct, speaking all of my preceptor first and then of my<br>preceptor's preceptor, art thou not ashamed?[265] Wait, wait! Bear thou<br>but one stroke of this my mace! I myself will bear many strokes of<br>thine.' Thus rebuked by the Satwata hero, Prishata's son, filled with<br>rage, smilingly addressed the angry Satyaki in these harsh words.'<br><br>"Dhrishtadyumna said, 'I have heard thy words, O thou of Madhu's race,<br>but I have forgiven thee. Being thyself unrighteous and sinful, desirest<br>thou to rebuke them that are righteous and honest? Forgiveness is<br>applauded in the world. Sin, however, does not deserve forgiveness. He<br>that is of sinful soul regards the forgiving person powerless. Thou art a<br>wretch in thy behaviour. Thou art of sinful soul. Thou art wedded to<br>unrighteousness. Thou art censurable in every respect, from the tip of<br>thy toe to the end of their hair. Desirest thou still to speak ill of<br>others? What can be more sinful than that act of thine, viz., thy<br>slaughter of the armless Bhurisravas while sitting in Praya, although<br>thou wert with the aid of celestial weapons. He had laid aside his<br>weapons and I slew him. O thou of crooked heart, what is there in that<br>act that is improper? How can he, O Satyaki, blame such an act who<br>himself has in Praya like an ascetic, and whose arms had been cut off by<br>another? That valiant enemy of thine had displayed his prowess having<br>struck thee with his foot and thrown thee down on the earth. Why didst<br>thou not then slay him, showing thy manliness? When Partha, however, had<br>already vanquished him, it was then that thou, acting most unrighteously,<br>didst kill the brave and valiant Somadatta's son. When Drona had sought<br>to rout the forces of the Pandavas, then I proceeded, shooting thousands<br>of arrows. Having thyself acted in such a way, like a Chandala, and<br>having thyself become worthy of reproach, desirest thou to reproach me in<br>such harsh words? Thou art a perpetrator of evil deeds, and not I, O<br>wretch the Vrishni race! Thou art the abode of all sinful deeds. Do not<br>again blame me. Be silent. It behoveth thee. Don't say anything unto me<br>after this. This is the reply I give thee with my lips. Don't say<br>anything more. If, from folly, thou repeatest such harsh words, I shall<br>then, in battle, despatch thee, with my arrows, to Yama's abode. By<br>righteousness alone, O fool, one cannot vanquish his enemies. Listen now<br>to the unrighteous acts of the Kurus also. Pandu's son, Yudhishthira was<br>some time back unrighteously deceived by them. O Satyaki, Draupadi also<br>was persecuted by them unrighteously. The Pandavas, with Krishna in their<br>company, were also exiled and they were robbed of their all, O fool, most<br>unrighteously. By an act of unrighteousness, again, has the ruler of the<br>Madras been withdrawn from us by the enemy. By an act of unrighteousness<br>also was the son of Subhadra slain. On this side, it was by an act of<br>unrighteousness that Bhishma, the Kuru grandsire, was slain. Bhurisravas,<br>too, was, by an act of unrighteousness, slain by thee that art so<br>acquainted with righteousness. Even thus have the enemy, as also the<br>Pandavas, acted in this battle. Possessed of courage and acquainted with<br>morality, all of them, O Satwata, have acted thus, for gaining victory.<br>High morality is difficult of ascertainment. Similarly, immorality also<br>can with difficulty be comprehended. Fight now with the Kauravas, without<br>returning to the home of thy fathers.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing these harsh and cruel words (from<br>Dhrishtadyumna's lips), the blessed Satyaki began to tremble from head to<br>foot. With rage his eyes assumed the hue of copper. Keeping his bow then<br>upon his car, he grasped his mace, sighing like a Snake. Rushing, then,<br>towards the prince of the Panchalas, he said unto him in great wrath, 'I<br>will not speak harshly to thee, but I will slay thee, deserving as thou<br>art of slaughter.' Seeing the mighty Satyaki rushing, from wrath and<br>desire of revenge, at the Panchala prince, like Yama against one like his<br>own self, the mighty Bhima, urged by Vasudeva, quickly jumped down from<br>his car and seized him with his arms. Endued with great strength,<br>Satyaki, who was rushing in great wrath, proceeded for a few steps,<br>forcibly dragging after him the mighty son of Pandu who was endeavouring<br>to hold him back. Then Bhima firmly planting his feet stopped at the<br>sixth step that foremost of strong men, viz., that bull of Sini's race.<br>Then Sahadeva, O king, jumping down from his own car, addressed Satyaki,<br>thus held fast by the strong arms of Bhima, in these words, 'O tiger<br>among men, O thou of Madhu's race, we have no friends dearer to us than<br>the Andhakas, the Vrishnis and the Panchalas. So also the Andhakas and<br>the Vrishnis, particularly Krishna, cannot have any friends dearer than<br>ourselves. The Panchalas, also, O thou of Vrishni's race, even if they<br>search the whole world to the confines of the sea, have no friends dearer<br>to them than the Pandavas and the Vrishnis. Thou art even such a friend<br>to this prince; and he also is a similar friend to thee. Ye all are to us<br>even as we are to you. Acquainted as thou art with all duties,<br>remembering now the duties thou owest to friends, restrain this wrath of<br>thine, that has the prince of the Panchalas for its object. Be calm, O<br>foremost one of Sini's race! Forgive the son of Prishata, and let<br>Prishata's son also forgive thee. Ourselves also will practise<br>forgiveness. What is there that is better than forgiveness?'<br><br>"While the scion of Sini, O sire, was thus being pacified by Sahadeva,<br>the son of the Panchala king, smiling, said these words, 'Release Sini's<br>grandson, O Bhima who is so proud of his prowess in battle. Let him come<br>at me like the wind assailing the mountains, till, with my keen arrows, O<br>son of Kunti, I quell his rage and desire for battle and take his life.<br>Yonder come the Kauravas. I shall (after staying Satyaki) achieve this<br>great task of the Pandavas that has presented itself. Or let Phalguna<br>resist all the enemies in battle. As regards myself, I will fell this<br>one's head with my arrows. He taketh me for the armless Bhurisravas in<br>battle. Release him. Either I will slay him or he will slay me.' Hearing<br>these words of the Panchala prince, the mighty Satyaki held fast in<br>Bhima's clasp, sighing like a snake, began to tremble. Both of them,<br>endued with great might and possessed of powerful arms, began to roar<br>like a couple of bulls. Then Vasudeva, O sire, and king Yudhishthira the<br>just, with great effort, succeeded in pacifying those heroes. Having<br>pacified those two great bowmen, those two heroes, whose eyes had become<br>blood-red with rage, all the Kshatriyas (of the Pandava) army proceeded<br>against the warriors of the hostile army for battle.'
