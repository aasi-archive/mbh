                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding Drona filled with great anxiety and almost<br>deprived of his senses by grief, Dhrishtadyumna, the son of the Panchala<br>king, rushed at him. That hero had, for the destruction of Drona, been<br>obtained by Drupada, that ruler of men, at a great sacrifice, from the<br>Bearer of sacrificial libations. Desirous of slaying Drona, he now took<br>up a victory-giving and formidable bow whose twang resembled the roll of<br>the clouds, whose string was possessed of great strength, and which was<br>irrefragable and celestial. And he fixed on it a fierce arrow, resembling<br>a snake of virulent poison and possessed of the splendour of fire. That<br>arrow, resembling a fire of fierce flame, while within the circle of his<br>bow, looked like the autumnal sun of great splendour within a radiant<br>circle. Beholding that blazing bow bent with force by Prishata's son, the<br>troops regarded that to be the last hour (of the world). Seeing that<br>arrow aimed at him, the valiant son of Bharadwaja thought that the last<br>hour of his body had come. The preceptor prepared with care to baffle<br>that shaft. The weapons, however, of that high-souled one, O monarch, no<br>longer appeared at his bidding.[253] His weapons had not been exhausted<br>although he had shot them ceaselessly for four days and one night. On the<br>expiry, however, of the third part of that of the fifth day, his arrows<br>became exhausted. Seeing the exhaustion of his arrows and afflicted with<br>grief on account of his son's death, and in consequence also of the<br>unwillingness of the celestial weapons to appear at his bidding, he<br>desired to lay aside his weapons, as requested by the words of the Rishis<br>also. Though filled with great energy, he could not however, fight as<br>before. Then taking up another celestial bow that Angiras had given him,<br>and certain arrows that resembled a Brahmana's curse, he continued to<br>fight with Dhrishtadyumna. He covered the Panchala prince with a thick<br>shower of arrows, and filled with rage, mangled his angry antagonist.<br>With his own keen shafts he cut off in a hundred fragments those of the<br>prince as also the latter's standard and bow. He then his antagonist's<br>driver. Then Dhrishtadyumna, smiling, took up another bow, and pierced<br>Drona with a keen shaft in the centre of the chest. Deeply pierced<br>therewith and losing his self-possession in that encounter, that mighty<br>bowman, then, with a sharp and broad-headed arrow, once more cut off<br>Dhrishtadyumna's bow. Indeed, the invincible Drona then cut off all the<br>weapons, O king, and all the bows that his antagonist had, with the<br>exception only of his mace and sword. Filled with rage, he then pierced<br>the angry Dhrishtadyumna, O chastiser of foes, nine keen arrows, capable<br>of taking the life of every foe. Then the mighty car-warrior<br>Dhrishtadyumna, of immeasurable soul, invoking into existence the Brahma<br>weapon, caused the steeds of his own car to be mingled with those of his<br>foes. Endued with the speed of the wind, those steeds that were red and<br>of the hue of pigeons, O bull of Bharata's race, thus mingled together,<br>looked exceedingly beautiful. Indeed, O king, those steeds thus mingled<br>together on the field of battle, looked beautiful like roaring clouds in<br>the season of rains, charged with lightning. Then that twice-born one of<br>immeasurable soul cut off the shaft-joints, the wheel-joints, and (other)<br>car-joints of Dhrishtadyumna. Deprived of his bow, and made carless and<br>steedless and driverless, the heroic Dhrishtadyumna, fallen into great<br>distress, grasped a mace. Filled with rage, the mighty car-warrior,<br>Drona, of unbaffled prowess, by means of a number of keen shafts, cut off<br>that mace, while it was on the point of being hurled at him. Beholding<br>his mace cut off by Drona with arrows, that tiger among men, (viz., the<br>Panchala prince), took up a spotless sword and a bright shield decked<br>with a hundred moons. Without doubt, under those circumstances, the<br>Panchala prince determined to make an end of that foremost of preceptors,<br>that high-souled warrior. Sometimes, sheltering himself in his car-box<br>and sometimes riding on his car-shafts, the prince moved about, uplifting<br>his swords and whirling his bright shield. The mighty car-warrior<br>Dhrishtadyumna, desirous of achieving, from folly, a difficult feat,<br>hoped to pierce the chest of Bharadwaja's son in that battle. Sometimes,<br>he stayed upon the yoke, and sometimes under the haunches of Drona's red<br>steeds. These movements of his were highly applauded by all the troops.<br>Indeed, while he stayed amid the trappings of the yoke or behind those<br>red steeds, Drona found no opportunity to strike him. All this seemed<br>exceedingly wonderful. The movements of both Drona and Prishata's son in<br>that battle resembled the fight of hawk careering through the welkin for<br>a piece of meat. Then Drona, by means of a dart pierced the white steeds<br>of his antagonist, one after another, not striking, however, the red ones<br>amongst them (that belonged to himself)[254]. Deprived of life, those<br>steeds of Dhrishtadyumna fell down upon the earth. Thereupon, the red<br>steeds of Drona himself, O king, where freed from the entanglements of<br>Dhrishtadyumna's car. Beholding his steeds slain by that foremost of<br>Brahmanas, Prishata's sons, that mighty car-warrior, that foremost of<br>fighters, could not brook it. Though deprived of his car, still that<br>foremost of all swordsmen, armed with his sword, sprang towards Drona, O<br>monarch, like Vinata's son (Garuda) making a swoop at a snake. The form,<br>O king, of Dhrishtadyumna at that time, when he sought to slay the son of<br>Bharadwaja, resembled the form of Vishnu himself in days of yore when at<br>the point of slaying Hiranyakasipu. He performed diverse evolutions, in<br>fact. O Kauravya, the son of Prishata, careering in that battle,<br>exhibited the well-known one and twenty different kinds of motion. Armed<br>with the sword, and shield in hand, Prishata's son wheeled about and<br>whirled his sword on high, and made side thrusts, and rushed forward, and<br>ran sideways, and leapt high, and assailed the flanks of his antagonists<br>and receded backwards, and closed with his foes, and pressed them hard.<br>Having practised them well, he also showed the evolutions called Bharata,<br>Kausika Satwata, as he careened in that battle for compassing the<br>destruction of Drona, Beholding those beautiful evolutions of<br>Dhrishtadyumna, as he careered on the field, sword and shield in hand,<br>all the warriors, as also the celestials assembled there, were filled<br>with wonder. The regenerate Drona then, shooting a thousand arrows in the<br>thick of fight, cut off the sword of Dhrishtadyumna as also his shield,<br>decked with a hundred moons. Those arrows that Drona shot, while fighting<br>from such a near point, were of the length of a span. Such arrows are<br>used only in close fight. None else have arrows of that kind, except<br>Kripa, and Partha, and Aswatthaman and Karna, Pradyumna and Yuyudhana;<br>Abhimanyu also had such arrows. Then the preceptor, desirous of slaying<br>his disciple who was unto him even as his own son, fixed on his<br>bow-string a shaft endued with great impetuosity. That shaft, however,<br>Satyaki cut off by means of ten arrows, in the very sight of thy son as<br>also of the high-souled Karna, as thus rescued Dhrishtadyumna who was on<br>the point of succumbing to Drona. Then Kesava and Dhananjaya beheld<br>Satyaki of prowess incapable of being baffled, who, O Bharata, was thus<br>careering in the car-tracks (of the Kuru warriors) and within the range<br>of the shafts of Drona and Karna and Kripa. Saying. 'Excellent,<br>Excellent!' both of them loudly applauded Satyaki of unfading glory, who<br>was thus destroying the celestial weapons of all those warriors. Then<br>Kesava and Dhananjaya rushed towards the Kurus. Addressing Krishna,<br>Dhananjaya said, 'Behold, O Kesava, that perpetuator of Madhu's race,<br>viz., Satyaki of true prowess, sporting before the preceptor and those<br>mighty car-warriors and gladdening me and the twins and Bhima and king<br>Yudhishthira. With skill acquired by practice and without insolence,<br>behold that enhancer of the fame of the Vrishnis, viz., Satyaki,<br>careering in battle, sporting the while with those mighty car-warriors.<br>All these troops, as also the Siddhas (in the welkin), beholding him<br>invincible in battle, are filled with wonder, and applauding him, saying,<br>'Excellent, Excellent!' Indeed, O king, the warriors of both armies all<br>applauded the Satwata hero, for his feats.'"
