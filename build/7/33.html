                            "Sanjaya said, 'The Parthas then, headed by Bhimasena, approached that<br>invincible array protected by Bharadwaja's son. And Satyaki, and<br>Chekitana, and Dhrishtadyumna. the son of Prishata, and Kuntibhoja of<br>great prowess, and the mighty car-warrior Drupada. and Arjuna's son<br>(Abhimanyu), and Kshatradharman, and the valiant Vrihatkshatra, and<br>Dhrishtaketu, the ruler of the Chedis, and the twin sons of Madri, (viz.,<br>Nakula and Sahadeva), and Ghatotkacha, and the powerful Yudhamanyu and<br>the unvanquished Sikhandin, and the irresistible Uttamaujas and the<br>mighty car-warrior Virata, and the five sons of Draupadi,&#8212;these all<br>excited with wrath, and the valiant son of Sisupala, and the Kaikeyas of<br>mighty energy, and the Srinjayas by thousands,&#8212;these and others,<br>accomplished in weapons and difficult of being resisted in battle,<br>suddenly rushed, at the head of their respective followers, against<br>Bharadwaja's son, from a desire of battle. The valiant son of Bharadwaja,<br>however, fearlessly checked all those warriors, as soon as they came<br>near, with a thick shower of arrows. Like a mighty wave of waters coming<br>against an impenetrable hill, or the surging sea itself approaching its<br>bank, those warriors were pushed back by Drona. And the Pandavas, O king,<br>afflicted by the shafts shot from Drona's bow, were unable to stay before<br>him. And the strength of Drona's arms that we saw was wonderful in the<br>extreme, inasmuch as the Panchalas and the Srinjayas failed to approach<br>him. Beholding Drona advancing in rage. Yudhishthira thought of diverse<br>means for checking his progress. At last, regarding Drona incapable of<br>being resisted by any one else, Yudhishthira placed that heavy and<br>unbearable burden on the son of Subhadra. Addressing Abhimanyu, that<br>slayer of hostile heroes, who was not inferior to Vasudeva himself and<br>whose energy was superior to that of Arjuna, the king said, 'O child, act<br>in such a way that Arjuna, returning (from the Samsaptakas), may not<br>reprove us. We do not know how to break the circular array. Thyself, or<br>Arjuna or Krishna, or Pradyumna, can pierce that array. O mighty-armed<br>one, no fifth person can be found (to achieve that teat). O child, it<br>behoveth thee, O Abhimanyu, to grant the boon that thy sires, thy<br>maternal uncles, and all these troops ask of thee. Taking up thy arms<br>quickly, destroy this array of Drona, else Arjuna, returning from the<br>fight, will reprove us all.'<br><br>"Abhimanyu said, 'Desiring victory to my sires, soon shall I in battle<br>penetrate into that firm, fierce and foremost of arrays formed by Drona.<br>I have been taught by my father the method of (penetrating and) smiting<br>this kind of array. I shall not be able, however, to come out if any kind<br>of danger overtakes me.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Break this array once, O foremost of warriors, and<br>make a passage for us. All of us will follow thee in the track by which<br>thou wilt go. In battle, thou art equal to Dhananjaya himself. Seeing<br>thee enter, we shall follow thee, protecting thee on all sides.'<br><br>"Bhima said, 'I myself will follow thee, and Dhrishtadyumna and Satyaki,<br>and the Panchalas, and the Prabhadrakas. After the array once is broken<br>by thee, will enter it repeatedly and slay the foremost warriors within<br>it.'<br><br>"Abhimanyu said, 'I will penetrate into this invincible array of Drona,<br>like an insect filled with rage entering a blazing fire. Today, I will do<br>that which will be beneficial to both races (viz., my sire's and my<br>mother's). I will do that which will please my maternal uncle as also my<br>mother. Today all creatures will behold large bodies of hostile soldiers<br>continually slaughtered by myself, an unaided child. If anybody,<br>encountering me, escapes today with life, I shall not then regard myself<br>begotten by Partha and born of Subhadra. If on a single car I cannot in<br>battle cut off the whole Kshatriya race into eight fragments, I will not<br>regard myself the son of Arjuna.'[63]<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Since protected by these tigers among men, these<br>great bowmen endued with fierce might, these warriors that resemble the<br>Sadhyas, the Rudras, or the Maruts, or are like the Vasus, or Agni or<br>Aditya himself in prowess, thou venturest to pierce the invincible array<br>of Drona, and since thou speakest so, let thy strength, O son of Subhadra<br>be increased.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing these words of Yudhishthira, Abhimanyu<br>ordered his charioteer, Sumitra, saying, Quickly urge the steeds towards<br>Drona's army.'"
