                            "Sanjaya said, 'Kunti's son, Dhananjaya, of inconceivable prowess<br>thinking of how to accomplish his vow, recollected the mantras (given to<br>him by Vyasa). And soon he was lulled in the arms of sleep. Unto that<br>ape-bannered hero, burning with grief and immersed in thought Kesava,<br>having Garuda on his banner, appeared in a dream. Dhananjaya of righteous<br>soul, inconsequence of his love and veneration for Kesava, never omitted<br>under any circumstances to stand up and advance a few steps for receiving<br>Krishna. Rising up, therefore, now (in his dream), he gave unto Govinda a<br>seat. He himself, however, at that time, did not set his heart upon<br>taking his seat. Then Krishna, of mighty energy, knowing the resolution<br>of Partha, said, while seated, unto the son of Kunti, these words while<br>the latter was standing: 'Do not set thy heart, O Partha, on grief. Time<br>is unconquerable. Time forceth all creatures into the inevitable course.<br>O foremost of men what for is this grief of thine? Grief should not be<br>indulged in, O foremost of learned persons! Grief is an impediment to<br>action. Accomplish that act which should be accomplished. The grief that<br>maketh a person forgo all efforts is, indeed, O Dhananjaya, an enemy of<br>that person. A person, by indulging in grief, gladdens his foes and<br>saddens his friends, while the person is himself weakened. Therefore, it<br>behoveth thee not to grieve.' Thus addressed by Vasudeva, the<br>unvanquished Vibhatsu of great learning then said these words of grave<br>import: 'Grave is the vow that I have made about the slaughter of<br>Jayadratha. Even tomorrow I shall slay that wicked wretch, that slayer of<br>my son. Even this hath been my vow, O Kesava! For frustrating my vow,<br>Jayadratha, protected by all the mighty car-warriors, will be kept in<br>their rear by the Dhartarashtras. Their force, number, consists, O<br>Madhava, of remnant, after slaughter, of eleven Akshauhinis of troops,<br>difficult of being vanquished. Surrounded in battle as he will be by all<br>of them and by all the great car-warriors, how shall he obtain a sight, O<br>Krishna, of the wicked rule of the Sindhus? My vow will not be<br>accomplished, O Kesava! How can a person like me live, having failed to<br>accomplish his vow? O hero, the non-accomplishment is evident of this (my<br>vow which to me is a) source of great grief. (At this season of the<br>year), I tell thee that the sun setteth quickly.' The bird-bannered<br>Krishna hearing this cause of Partha's grief, touched water and sat with<br>face turned to the east. And then that hero, of eyes like lotus leaves,<br>and possessed of great energy, said these words for the benefit of<br>Pandu's son who had resolved upon the slaughter of the ruler of the<br>Sindhus, 'O Partha, there is an indestructible, supreme weapon of the<br>name of Pasupata. With it the god Maheswara slew in battle all the<br>Daityas! If thou rememberest it now, thou shalt then be able to slay<br>Jayadratha tomorrow. If it is unknown to thee (now), adore within thy<br>heart the god having the bull for his mark. Thinking of that god in thy<br>mind, remember him, O Dhananjaya! Thou art his devotee. Through his grace<br>thou shalt obtain that rich possession.' Hearing these words of Krishna,<br>Dhananjaya, having touched water, sat on the earth with concentrated mind<br>and thought of the god Bhava. After he had thus sat with rapt mind at<br>that hour called Brahma of auspicious indications, Arjuna saw himself<br>journeying through the sky with Kesava. And Partha, possessed of the<br>speed of the mind, seemed to reach, with Kesava, the sacred foot of<br>Himavat and the Manimat mountain abounding in many brilliant gems and<br>frequented by Siddhas and Charanas. And the lord Kesava seemed to have<br>caught hold of his left arm. And he seemed to see many wonderful sights<br>as he reached (those place). And Arjuna of righteous soul then seemed to<br>arrive at the White mountain on the north. And then he beheld, in the<br>pleasure-gardens of Kuvera the beautiful lake decked with lotuses. And he<br>also saw that foremost of rivers, viz., the Ganga full of water. And then<br>he arrived at the regions about the Mandara mountains. Those regions were<br>covered with trees that always bore blossoms and fruits. And they<br>abounded with stones lying scattered about, that were all transparent<br>crystal. And they were inhabited by lions and tigers and abounded with<br>animals of diverse kinds. And they were adorned with many beautiful<br>retreats of ascetics, echoing with the sweet notes of delightful<br>warblers. And they resounded also with the songs of Kinnaras. Graced with<br>many golden and silver peaks, they were illumined with diverse herbs and<br>plants. And many Mandara trees with their pretty loads of flowers,<br>adorned them. And then Arjuna reached the mountains called Kala that<br>looked like a mound of antimony. And then he reached the summit called<br>Brahmatunga, and then many rivers, and then many inhabited provinces. And<br>he arrived at Satasinga, and the woods known by the name of Sharyati. And<br>then he beheld the sacred spot known as the Horse-head, and then the<br>region of Atharvana. And then he beheld that prince of mountains called<br>Vrishadansa, and the great Mandara, abounding in Apsaras, and graced with<br>the presence of the Kinnaras. And roaming on that mountain, Partha, with<br>Krishna, beheld a spot of earth adorned with excellent fountains, decked<br>with golden mineral, and possessed of the splendour of the lunar rays,<br>and having many cities and towns. And he also beheld many seas of<br>wonderful forms and diverse mines of wealth. And thus going through the<br>sky and firmament and the earth, he reached the spot called Vishnupada.<br>And wandering, with Krishna in his company, he came down with great<br>velocity, like a shaft shot (from a bow). And soon Partha beheld a<br>blazing mountain whose splendour equalled that of the planets, the<br>constellations, or fire. And arrived at that mountain, he beheld on its<br>top, the high-souled god having the bull for his mark, and ever engaged<br>in ascetic penances, like a thousand suns collected together, and blazing<br>with his own effulgence. Trident in hand, matted locks on the head, of<br>snow-white colour, he was robed in bark and skin. Endued with great<br>energy, his body seemed to be flaming with a thousand eyes. And he was<br>seated with Parvati and many creatures of brilliant forms (around him).<br>And his attendants were engaged in singing and playing upon musical<br>instruments, in laughing and dancing, in moving and stretching their<br>hands, and In uttering loud shouts. And the place was perfumed with<br>fragrant odours, and Rishis that worshipped Brahma adored with excellent<br>hymns of unfading glory, that God who was the protector of all creatures,<br>and wielded the (great) bow (called Pinaka). Beholding him, Vasudeva of<br>righteous soul, with Partha, touched the earth with his head, uttering<br>the eternal words of the Veda. And Krishna adored, with speech, mind,<br>understanding, and acts, that God who is the first source of the<br>universe, himself uncreate, the supreme lord of unfading glory: who is<br>the highest cause of the mind, who is space and the wind, who is the<br>cause of all the luminous bodies (in the firmament), who is the creator<br>of the rain, and the supreme, primordial substance of the earth, who is<br>the object of adoration, with the gods, the Danavas, the Yakshas, and<br>human beings; who is the supreme Brahma that is seen by Yogins and the<br>refuge of those acquainted with Shastras, who is the creator of all<br>mobile and immobile creatures, and their destroyer also; who is the Wrath<br>that burns everything at the end of the Yuga; who is the supreme soul;<br>who is the Sakra and Surya, and the origin of all attributes. And Krishna<br>sought the protection of that Bhava, whom men of knowledge, desirous of<br>attaining to that which is called the subtle and the spiritual, behold;<br>that uncreate one is the soul of all causes. And Arjuna repeatedly adored<br>that Deity, knowing that he was the origin of all creatures and the cause<br>of the past, the future, and the present. Beholding those two, viz., Nara<br>and Narayana arrived, Bhava of cheerful soul, smilingly said unto them,<br>'Welcome are ye, ye foremost of men! Rise up and let the fatigue of your<br>journey be over. What, O heroes, is the desire in your heart? Let it be<br>uttered quickly. What is the business that has brought you hither? I will<br>accomplish it and do what would benefit you. I will grant everything ye<br>may desire., Hearing those words of the god, they both rose. And then<br>with joined hands, the faultless Vasudeva and Arjuna, both of great<br>wisdom, began to gratify that high-souled deity with an excellent hymn.<br>And Krishna and Arjuna said, 'We bow to Bhava, to Sarva, to Rudra, to the<br>boon-giving deity. We bow to the lord of all creatures endued with life,<br>to the god who is always fierce, to him who is called Kapardin! We bow to<br>Mahadeva, to Bhima, to the Three-eyed, to him who is peace and<br>contentment. We bow to Isana, to him who is the destroyer of (Daksha's)<br>sacrifice. Let salutations be to the slayer of Andhaka, to the father of<br>Kumara, to him who is of blue throat, to him who is the creator.' Let<br>salutation be to the wielder of Pinaka, to one worthy of the offer of<br>libations of clarified butter, to him who is truth, to him who is<br>all-pervading. To him who is unvanquished! To him who is always of blue<br>locks, to him who is armed with the trident, to him who is of celestial<br>vision! To him who is Hotri, to him who protects all, to, him who is of<br>three eyes, to him who is disease, to him whose vital seed fell on fire!<br>To him who is inconceivable, to him who is the lord of Amvika, to him who<br>is adored by all the gods! To him who hath the bull for his mark, to him<br>who is bold, to him who is of matted lock, to him who is a Brahmacharin!<br>To him who standeth as an ascetic in the water, to him who is devoted to<br>Brahma, to him who hath never been conquered! To him who is the soul of<br>the universe, to him who is the creator of the universe, to him who<br>liveth pervading the whole universe! We bow to thee that art, the object<br>of the reverence of all, to thee that art the original cause of all<br>creatures! To thee that art called Brahmachakra, to thee that art called<br>Sarva, Sankara, and Siva! We bow to thee that art the lord of all great<br>beings! We bow to thee that hast a thousand heads, to thee that hast a<br>thousand arms, to thee that art called Death! To thee that hast a<br>thousand eyes, a thousand legs? To thee whose acts are innumerable! We<br>bow to thee whose complexion is that of gold, to thee that art cased in<br>golden mail, to thee that art ever compassionate to thy devotees! O lord,<br>let our wish be accomplished.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Having adored Mahadeva in these terms, Vasudeva with<br>Arjuna then began to gratify him for obtaining (the great) weapon (called<br>Pasupata).'"
