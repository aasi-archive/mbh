                            "Sanjaya said, 'That joy of Vishnu's sister (viz., Abhimanyu), that<br>Atiratha, decked with the weapons of Vishnu himself, looked exceedingly<br>beautiful on the field of battle and looked like a second Janardana. With<br>the end of his locks waving in the air, with that supreme weapon upraised<br>in his hands, his body became incapable of being looked at by the very<br>gods. The kings beholding it and the wheel in his hands, became filled<br>with anxiety, and cut that off in a hundred fragments. Then that great<br>car-warrior, the son of Arjuna, took up a mighty mace. Deprived by them<br>of his bow and car and sword, and divested also of his wheel by his foes,<br>the mighty-armed Abhimanyu (mace in hand) rushed against Aswatthaman.<br>Beholding that mace upraised, which looked like the blazing thunderbolt,<br>Aswatthaman, that tiger among men, rapidly alighted from his car and took<br>three (long) leaps (for avoiding Abhimanyu). Slaying Aswatthaman's steeds<br>and two Parshni charioteers with that mace of his, Subhadra's son,<br>pierced all over with arrows, looked like a porcupine. Then that hero<br>pressed Suvala's son, Kalikeya, down into the earth, and stew seven and<br>seventy Gandhara followers of the latter. Next, he slew ten car-warriors<br>of the Brahma-Vasatiya race, and then ten huge elephants. Proceeding next<br>towards the car of Duhsasana's son, he crushed the latter's car and<br>steeds, pressing them down into the earth. The invincible son of<br>Duhsasan, then, O sire, taking up his mace, rushed at Abhimanyu. saying,<br>'Wait, Wait!' Then those cousins, those two heroes, with upraised maces,<br>began to strike each other, desirous of achieving each other's death,<br>like three-eyed (Mahadeva) and (the Asura) Andhaka in the days of old. I<br>ach of those chastisers of foes, struck with the other's mace-ends fell<br>down on the earth, like two uprooted standards erected to the honour of<br>Indra. Then Duhsasana's son, that enhancer of the fame of the Kurus,<br>rising up first, struck Abhimanyu with the mace on the crown of his head,<br>as the latter, was on the point of rising. Stupefied with the violence of<br>that stroke as also with the fatigue he had undergone, that slayer of<br>hostile hosts, viz., the son of Subhadra, fell on the earth, deprived of<br>his senses. Thus, O king, was one slain by many in battle,&#8212;one who had<br>ground the whole army, like an elephant grinding lotus-stalks in a lake.<br>As he lay dead on the field, the heroic Abhimanyu looked like a wild<br>elephant slain by the hunters, The fallen hero was then surrounded by thy<br>troops. And he looked like an extinguished fire in the summer season<br>after (as it lies) having consumed a whole forest, or like a tempest<br>divested of its fury after having crushed mountain crests;[80] or like<br>the sun arrived at the western hills after having blasted with his heat<br>the Bharata host; or like Soma swallowed up by Rahu; or like the ocean<br>reft of water. The mighty car-warriors of thy army beholding Abhimanyu<br>whose face had the splendour of the full moon, and whose eyes were<br>rendered beautiful in consequence of lashes black as the feathers of the<br>raven, lying prostrate on the bare earth, were filled with great joy. And<br>they repeatedly uttered leonine shouts. Indeed, O monarch, thy troops<br>were in transports of joy, while tears fell fast from the eyes of the<br>Pandava heroes. Beholding the heroic Abhimanyu lying on the field of<br>battle, like the moon dropped from the firmament, diverse creatures, O<br>king, in the welkin, said aloud, 'Alas, this one lieth on the field,<br>slain, while fighting singly, by six mighty car-warriors of the<br>Dhartarashtra army, headed by Drona and Karna. This act hath been, we<br>hold, an unrighteous one.' Upon the slaughter of that hero, the earth<br>looked exceedingly resplendent like the star-bespangled firmament with<br>the moon. Indeed, the earth was strewn with shafts equipped with wings of<br>gold, and covered with waves of blood. And strewn with the beautiful<br>heads of heroes, decked with ear-rings and variegated turbans of great<br>value, and banner and yak-tails and beautiful blankets, and begemmed<br>weapons of great efficacy, and the bright ornaments of cars and steeds,<br>and men and elephants, and sharp and well-tempered swords, looking like<br>snakes freed from their sloughs, and bows, and broken shafts, and darts,<br>and swords, and lances, and Kampanas, and diverse other kinds of weapons,<br>she assumed a beautiful aspect. And in consequence of the steeds dead or<br>dying, but all weltering in blood, with their riders (lying about them),<br>felled by Subhadra's son, the earth in many places became impassable. And<br>with iron hooks, and elephants&#8212;huge as hills&#8212;equipped with shields and<br>weapons and standards, lying about, crushed with shafts, with excellent<br>cars deprived of steeds and charioteers and car-warriors, lying scattered<br>on the earth, crushed by elephants and looking like agitated lakes, with<br>large bodies of foot-soldiers decked with diverse weapons and lying dead<br>on the ground, the field of battle, wearing a terrible aspect, inspired<br>all timid hearts with terror.<br><br>"Beholding Abhimanyu, resplendent as the sun or the moon, lying on the<br>ground, thy troops were in transport of joy, while Pandavas were filled<br>with grief. When youthful Abhimanyu, yet in his minority, fell, the<br>Pandava divisions, O king, fled away in the very sight of king<br>Yudhishthira. Beholding his army breaking upon the fall of Subhadra's<br>son, Yudhishthira addressed his brave warriors, slaying, 'The heroic<br>Abhimanyu, who without retreating from battle hath been slain, hath<br>certainly ascended to heaven. Stay then, and fear not, for we shall yet<br>vanquish our foes.' Endued with great energy and great splendour, king<br>Yudhishthira the just, that foremost of warriors, saying such words unto<br>his soldiers inspired with grief, endeavoured to dispel their stupor. The<br>king continued, 'Having in the first instance, slain in battle hostile<br>princes, resembling snakes of virulent poison, the son of Arjuna hath<br>then given up his life. Having slain ten thousand warriors, viz., the<br>king of the Kosalas, Abhimanyu, who was even like Krishna or Arjuna<br>himself, hath assuredly gone to the abode of Indra. Having destroyed cars<br>and steeds and men and elephants by thousands, he was still not content<br>with what he did. Performing as he did such meritorious feats, we should<br>not certainly grieve for him, he hath gone to the bright regions of the<br>righteous, regions that men acquire by meritorious deeds.'"
