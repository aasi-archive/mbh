                            "Sanjaya said, 'Hearing of the origin of Death and her strange acts, king<br>Yudhishthira, humbly addressing Vyasa, once more said these words unto<br>him.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Many kings there were in blessed countries, of<br>righteous deeds and of prowess equal to that of Indra himself. They were<br>royal sages, O regenerate one, that were sinless and truth-speaking. Once<br>more, address me in words of grave import, and console me with (accounts<br>of) the feats of those royal sages of ancient times. What was the measure<br>of the sacrificial gifts made by them? Who were those high-souled royal<br>sages of righteous deeds that made them? Tell me all this, O illustrious<br>one!'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'There was a king of the name of Switya. He had a son who<br>was called Srinjaya. The Rishis Narada and Parvata were his friends. One<br>day, the two ascetics, for paying Srinjaya a visit, came to his palace.<br>Duly worshipped by Srinjaya, they became pleased with him, and continued<br>to live with him happily. Once on a time as Srinjaya was seated at his<br>case with the two ascetics, his beautiful daughter of sweet smiles came<br>to him. Saluted with reverence by his daughter, Srinjaya delighted that<br>girl standing by his side with proper benedictions of the kind she<br>desired. Beholding that maiden, Parvata smilingly asked Srinjaya, saying,<br>'Whose daughter is this damsel of restless glances and possessed of every<br>auspicious mark? Is she the splendour of Surya, or the flame of Agni? Or,<br>is she any of these, viz., Sri, Hri, Kirti, Dhriti, Pushti, Siddhi, and<br>the splendour of Soma?' After the celestial Rishi (Parvata) said these<br>words, king Srinjaya answered, saying, 'O illustrious one, this girl is<br>my daughter. She beggeth my blessings.' Then Narada addressed king<br>Srinjaya and said. 'If, O monarch, thou wishest for great good (to<br>thyself), then give this daughter of thine unto me for a wife.' Delighted<br>(with the Rishi's proposal), Srinjaya addressed Narada, saying, 'I give<br>her unto thee.' At this, the other Rishi, viz., Parvata, indignantly<br>addressed Narada, saying, 'Chosen before this by me, within my heart,<br>thou hast taken this damsel as thy wife. And since thou hast done this,<br>thou, O Brahmana, shalt not go to heaven as thy will.' Thus addressed by<br>him, Narada answered him, saying, 'The husband's heart and speech<br>(directed thereto), (the giver's) consent, the speeches (of both), the<br>actual gift made by sprinkling water, and the (recital of the mantras)<br>ordained for the seizure of the (bride's hand),&#8212;these have been declared<br>to be indications by which one is constituted a husband. Even this<br>ceremonial is not all. That which (above all) is essential is the walk<br>for seven paces (by the bride in circumambulating the bridegroom).[88]<br>Without these thy purpose (about marriage) have been unaccomplished. Thou<br>hast cursed. Therefore, thou also shalt not go to heaven without me.'<br>Having cursed each other those two Rishis continued to live there.<br>Meanwhile, king Srinjaya, desirous of (obtaining) a son, began, with<br>cleansed soul, to carefully entertain the Brahmanas, to the utmost of his<br>power, with food and robes. After a certain time, those foremost of<br>Brahmanas devoted to the study of the Vedas and fully conversant with<br>those scriptures and their branches became gratified with that monarch,<br>desirous of getting a son. Together they came to Narada and said unto<br>him, 'Give this king a son of the kind he desires.'&#8212;Thus addressed by<br>the Brahmanas, Narada replied unto them, saying, 'So be it.'&#8212;and then<br>the celestial Rishi addressed Srinjaya saying, 'O royal sage, the<br>Brahmanas have been pleased and they wish thee a son! Solicit thou the<br>boon, blessed be thou, about the kind of son thou desirest.' Thus<br>addressed by him, the king, with joined hands, asked for a son possessed<br>of every accomplishment, famous, of glorious feats, of great energy, and<br>capable of chastising all foes. And he further asked that the urine, the<br>excreta, the phlegm and the sweat of that child should be gold. And in<br>due time the king had a son born unto him, who came to be named<br>Suvarnashthivin[89] on earth. And in consequence of the boon, that child<br>began to increase (his father's) wealth beyond all limits. And king<br>Srinjaya caused all desirable things of his to be made of gold. And his<br>houses and walls and forts, and the houses of all Brahmanas (within his<br>dominions), and his beds, vehicles, and plates, and all manners of pots<br>and cups, and palace that he owned, and all implements and utensils,<br>domestic and otherwise were made of gold. And in time his stock<br>increased. Then certain robbers hearing of the prince and seeing him to<br>be such, assembled together and sought to injure the king. And some<br>amongst them said, 'We will seize the king's son himself. He is his<br>father's mine of gold. Towards that end, therefore, we should strive.'<br>Then those robbers inspired with avarice, penetrating into the king's<br>palace, forcibly took away prince Suvarnashthivin. Having seized and<br>taken him to the woods, those senseless idiots, inspired with avarice but<br>ignorant of what to do with him, slew him there and cut his body in<br>fragments. They saw not, however, any gold in him. After the prince was<br>slain, all the gold, obtained in consequence of the Rishi's boon,<br>disappeared. The ignorant and senseless robbers struck one another. And<br>striking one another thus, they perished and with them that wonderful<br>prince on the earth. And those men of wicked deeds sank in an<br>unimaginable and awful hell. Seeing that son of his, obtained through the<br>Rishi's boon thus slain, that great ascetic, viz., king Srinjaya,<br>afflicted with deep sorrow, began to lament in piteous accents. Beholding<br>the king afflicted with grief on account of his son, and thus weeping,<br>the celestial Rishi Narada showed himself in his presence. Listen, O<br>Yudhishthira, to what Narada said unto Srinjaya, having approached that<br>king, who afflicted with grief and deprived of his senses, was indulging<br>in piteous lamentations. Narada said, 'Srinjaya, with thy desires<br>unfulfilled, thou shalt have to die, although we utterers of Brahma, live<br>in thy house. Avikshit's son Marutta even, O Srinjaya, we hear, had to<br>die. Piqued with Vrihaspati, he had caused Samvatta[90] himself to<br>officiate at his great sacrifices! Unto that royal sage the illustrious<br>lord (Mahadeva) himself had given wealth in the shape of a golden plateau<br>of Himavat. (With that wealth) king Marutta had performed diverse<br>sacrifices. Unto him, after the completion of his sacrifices diverse<br>tribes of celestials, those creators of the universe, with Indra himself<br>in their company and with Vrihaspati at their head, used to come. All the<br>carpets and furnitures of his sacrificial compound were of gold. The<br>regenerate classes, desirous of food, all ate as they pleased, at his<br>sacrifices, food that was clean and agreeable to their desires. And in<br>all his sacrifices, milk and cards and clarified butter and honey, and<br>other kinds of food and edibles, all of the best order, and robes and<br>ornaments covetable for their costliness, gratified Brahmanas, thoroughly<br>conversant with the Vedas. The very gods used to become distributors of<br>food in king Marutta's palace. The Viswedevas were the courtiers of that<br>royal sage, the son of Avikshit. By him were gratified the denizens of<br>heaven with libations of clarified butter. And gratified (therewith),<br>these, in their turn, increased that powerful ruler's wealth of crops<br>with copious showers of rain. He always contributed to the gratification<br>of the Rishis, the Pitris, and the gods, and thereby made them happy, by<br>practising Brahmacharya, study of the Vedas, obsequial rites, and all<br>kinds of gifts. And his beds and carpets and vehicles, and his vast<br>stores of gold difficult to be given away, in fact, all that untold<br>wealth of his, was given away voluntarily unto the Brahmanas, Sakra<br>himself used to wish him well. His subjects were made happy (by him),<br>Acting always with piety, he (ultimately) repaired to those eternal<br>regions of bliss, acquired by his religious merit. With his children and<br>counsellors and wives and descendants and kinsmen, king Marutta, in his<br>youth, ruled his kingdom for a thousand years. When such a king, O<br>Srinjaya, died who was superior to thee, in respect of the four cardinal<br>virtues (viz., ascetic penances, truth, compassion, and liberality), and<br>who, superior to thee, was much superior to thy son, do not grieve saying<br>'O Swaitya, for thy son who performed no sacrifice and gave no<br>sacrificial present.'"
