                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then Drona, causing a great confusion in the Pandava<br>host, careered through it, like a conflagration consuming (a forest of)<br>trees. Beholding that angry warrior, owning a golden car, consume their<br>divisions like a raging conflagration, the Srinjayas trembled (in fear).<br>The twang, in that battle, of the constantly stretched bow of that<br>warrior of great activity was heard to resemble the roar of the<br>thunder.[24] Fierce shafts shot by Drona, endued with great lightness of<br>hand, began to crush car-warriors and horsemen and elephant-warriors and<br>foot soldiers along with elephants and steeds. Showering his arrows as<br>the roaring clouds at the close of summer, assisted by the wind, pour<br>hail-stones, he inspired fear in the hearts of the foe. Coursing (through<br>the hostile ranks), O king, and agitating the troops, the mighty Drona<br>enhanced the unnatural fear entertained by the enemy. The gold-decked<br>bow, on his quickly-moving car, was repeatedly seen to resemble the<br>lightning's flash amid a mass of dark clouds. That hero, firm in truth,<br>endued with wisdom, and always devoted, besides, to righteousness, caused<br>an awful river of angry current, such as may be seen at the end of the<br>Yuga, to flow there. And that river had its source in the impetuosity of<br>Drona's wrath, and it was haunted by crowds of carnivorous creatures. And<br>the combatants constituted the waves that filled its entire surface. And<br>heroic warriors constituted the trees on its banks whose roots were<br>constantly eaten away by its current. And its waters were constituted by<br>the blood that was shed in that battle, and cars constituted its eddies,<br>and elephants and steeds formed its banks. And costs of mail constituted<br>its lilies, and the flesh of creatures the mire on its bed. And the fat,<br>marrow, and bones (of fallen animals and men) formed the sands on its<br>beach, and (fallen) head-gears its froth. And the battle itself that was<br>fought there constituted the canopy above its surface. And lances<br>constituted the fish with which it abounded. And it was inaccessible in<br>consequence of the large number of (slain) men, elephants, and steeds<br>(that fell in it). And the impetus of the shaft shot constituted its<br>current. And the slain bodies themselves constituted the timber floating<br>on it. And cars constituted its tortoises. And heads constituted the<br>stones scattered on its banks and bed, and scimitars, its fish in<br>profusion. And cars and elephants formed its lakes. And it was decked<br>with many adornments. And mighty car-warriors constituted its hundreds of<br>little whirlpools. And the dust of the earth constituted its wavelets.<br>And capable of being easily crossed by those possessed of exceeding<br>energy, it was incapable of being crossed by the timid. And heaps of dead<br>bodies constituted the sand-banks obstructing its navigation. And it was<br>the haunt of Kankas and vultures and other birds of prey. And it carried<br>away thousands of mighty-car-warriors to the abode of Yama. And long<br>spears constituted the snakes that infested it in profusion. And the<br>living combatants constituted the fowls sporting on its waters.[25] Torn<br>umbrellas constituted its large swans. Diadems formed the (smaller) birds<br>that adorned it. Wheels constituted its turtles, and maces its<br>alligators, and arrows its smaller fish. And it was the resort of<br>frightful swarms of crows and vultures and jackals. And that river, O<br>best of kings, bore away in hundreds, to the region of the Pitris, the<br>creatures that were slain by Drona in battle. Obstructed by hundreds of<br>bodies (floating on it), the hair (of slain warriors and animals)<br>constituted its moss and weeds. Even such was the river, enhancing the<br>fears of the timid, that Drona caused to flow there.[26]<br><br>"And when Drona was thus grinding the hostile army hither and thither,<br>the Pandava warriors headed by Yudhishthira rushed at that mighty<br>car-warrior from all sides. Then seeing them thus rushing (towards<br>Drona), brave combatants of thy army, possessed of unyielding prowess,<br>rushed from every side. And the battle that thereupon ensued made the<br>hair stand on end. Sakuni, full of a hundred kinds of deceit, rushed<br>towards Sahadeva, and pierced the latter's charioteer, and standard, and<br>car, with many keen-pointed shafts. Sahadeva, however, without being much<br>excited, cutting off Sauvala's standard and bow and car-driver and car,<br>with sharp arrows, pierced Sauvala himself with sixty shafts. Thereupon,<br>Suvala's son, taking up mace, jumped down from his excellent car, and<br>with that mace, O king, he felled Sahadeva's driver from the latter's<br>car. Then these two heroic and mighty warriors, O monarch, both deprived<br>of car, and both armed with mace, sported in battle like two crests of<br>hills. Drona, having pierced the ruler of the Panchalas with ten shafts,<br>was, in return, pierced by the latter with many shafts. And the latter<br>was again pierced by Drona with a larger number of shafts. Bhimasena<br>pierced Vivinsati with sharp arrows. The latter, however, thus pierced,<br>trembled not, which seemed to be highly wonderful. Vivinsati then, O<br>monarch, suddenly deprived Bhimasena of his steeds and standard and bow.<br>And thereupon all the troops worshipped him for that feat. The heroic<br>Bhimasena, however, brooked not that exhibition of prowess by his enemy<br>in battle. With his mace, therefore, he slew the well-trained steeds of<br>Vivinsati. Then the mighty Vivinsati, taking up a shield (and sword)<br>jumped down from that car whose steeds had been slain, and rushed against<br>Bhimasena like an infuriated elephant rushing against an infuriated<br>compeer. The heroic Salya, laughing the while, pierced, as if in<br>dalliance, his own dear nephew, Nakula. with many shafts for angering<br>him. The valiant Nakula, however, cutting off his uncle's steeds and<br>umbrella and standard and charioteer and bow in that battle, blew his<br>conch. Dhrishtaketu, engaged with Kripa, cut off diverse kinds of arrows<br>shot at him by the latter, and then pierced Kripa, with seventy arrows.<br>And then he cut off the device of Kripa's standard with three arrows.<br>Kripa, however, began to oppose him with a thick shower of arrows. And<br>resisting him in this way, the Brahmana fought on with Dhrishtaketu.<br>Satyaki, laughing the while, pierced Kritavarman in the centre of the<br>chest with a long arrow. And piercing him then with seventy arrows, he<br>once more pierced him with many others. The Bhoja warrior, however, in<br>return, pierced Satyaki with seventy arrows of keen points. Like the<br>swiftly-coursing winds failing to move a mountain, Kritavarman was unable<br>to move Satyaki or make him tremble. Senapati deeply struck Susarman in<br>his vitals. Susarman also struck his antagonist with a lance on the<br>shoulder-joint. Virata, aided by his Matsya warriors of great energy,<br>resisted Vikartana's son in that battle. And that feat (of the Matsya<br>king) seemed highly wonderful. Even this was regarded as an act of great<br>valour on the part of the Suta's son, in that, he singly resisted that<br>whole force by means of his straight shafts. King Drupada was engaged<br>with Bhagadatta. And the battle between those two warriors became<br>beautiful to behold. That bull among men, viz., Bhagadatta, pierced king<br>Drupada and his driver and standard and car with many straight shafts.<br>Then Drupada, excited with wrath, quickly pierced that mighty car-warrior<br>in the chest with a straight shaft. Those two foremost of warriors on<br>earth, viz., Somadatta's son and Sikhandin, both conversant with every<br>weapon, encountered each other in fierce battle that made all creatures<br>tremble with fear. The valiant Bhurisravas, O king, covered that mighty<br>car-warrior, Yajnasena's son Sikhandin, with a thick shower of arrows.<br>Sikhandin, then O monarch, excited with wrath, pierced Somadatta's son<br>with ninety shafts, and caused him, O Bharata, to tremble. Those<br>Rakshasas of fierce deeds, viz., Hidimba's son and Alamvusha, each<br>desirous of vanquishing the other, battled most wonderfully. Both capable<br>of creating a hundred illusions, both swelling with pride, battled with<br>each other most wonderfully, relying on their powers of illusion, and<br>each desirous of vanquishing the other. The fierce Chekitana battled with<br>Anuvinda. They coursed on the field, disappearing at times, and causing<br>great wonder. Lakshmana fought fiercely with Kshatradeva, even as Vishnu,<br>O monarch, in days of old, with the (Asura) Hiranyaksha. With his fleet<br>steeds and upon his car duly equipped, Paurava, O king, roared at<br>Abhimanyu. Endued with great might, Paurava then rushed at Abhimanyu,<br>desirous of battle. Then that chastiser of foes, viz., Abhimanyu fought<br>fiercely with that foe. Paurava covered Subhadra's son with a thick<br>shower of arrows. Thereupon, Arjuna's son felled his antagonist's<br>standard and umbrella and bow on earth.[27] Then piercing Paurava with<br>seven arrows, Subhadra's son pierced the latter's driver and steeds with<br>five arrows. Gladdening his troops thus, he then repeatedly roared like a<br>lion. Then Arjuna's son quickly fixed an arrow on his bow-string that was<br>certain to take away Paurava's life. Beholding however, that arrow of<br>frightful mien fixed on Abhimanyu's bow-string, Haridika's son, with two<br>shafts, cut off that bow and arrow. Then that slayer of hostile heroes,<br>viz., Subhadra's son, throwing aside that broken bow, took up a bright<br>sword and a shield. Whirling with great speed that shield decked with<br>many stars, and whirling that sword also, he coursed on the field,<br>exhibiting his prowess. Whirling them before him, and whirling them on<br>high, now shaking them and now jumping up himself, from the manner of his<br>handling those weapons, it seemed that (with him) there is no difference<br>between that offensive and that defensive weapons. Jumping suddenly then<br>upon the shafts of Paurava's car, he roared aloud. Mounting next upon his<br>car, he seized Paurava by the hair, and slaying meanwhile with a kick,<br>the latter's driver, he felled his standard with a stroke of his sword.<br>And as regards Paurava himself, Abhimanyu raised him up, like the Garuda<br>raising a snake from the bottom of the sea agitating the waters.<br>Thereupon, all the kings beheld Paurava (standing helpless) with<br>dishevelled hair, and looking like an ox deprived of its senses while on<br>the point of being slain by a lion. Beholding Paurava thus prostrated,<br>placed under the control of Arjuna's son, and dragged helplessly,<br>Jayadratha was unable to brook it. Taking up a sword as also a shield<br>that bore the device of a peacock and was decked with a hundred bells of<br>small size suspended in rows, Jayadratha jumped down from his car with a<br>loud roar. Then Subhadra's son (Abhimanyu), beholding the ruler of the<br>Sindhus, let Paurava alone, and leaping up like a hawk from the latter's<br>car, quickly alighted on the earth. The lances and aves and scimitars<br>hurled by his foes&#8212;Arjuna's son cut off by means of his sword or warded<br>off by his shield. Thus showing unto all the warriors the strength of his<br>own arms the mighty [and heroic] Abhimanyu, once more upraising his large<br>and heavy sword as also his shield,[28] proceeded towards<br>Vriddhakshatra's son who was a sworn foe of his (Abhimanyu's) father,<br>like a tiger proceeding against an elephant. Approaching they cheerfully<br>attacked each other with their swords like a tiger and a lion with their<br>claws and teeth. And none could notice any difference between those two<br>lions among men as regards the whirl-strokes, and descent of their swords<br>and shields.[29] And as regards the descent and the whiz of their swords,<br>and the warding off of each other's blows, it seemed there was no<br>distinction between the two. Coursing, beautifully in outward and inward<br>tracks, those two illustrious warriors seemed to be like two winged<br>mountains. Then Jayadratha struck on the shield of the renowned Abhimanyu<br>when the latter stretched his sword for making a pass at him. Then, O<br>Bharata, Jayadratha's large sword sticking into Abhimanyu's shield<br>covered with golden plate, broke, as the ruler of the Sindhus attempted<br>to draw it off forcibly. Seeing his sword broken, Jayadratha hastily<br>retreated six steps and was seen within a twinkle of the eye to be<br>mounted on his own car. Then Arjuna's son also, that combat with the<br>sword being over, ascended his own excellent car. Many kings, then, of<br>the Kuru army, uniting together, surrounded him on all sides. The mighty<br>son of Arjuna, however, eyeing Jayadratha, whirled his sword and shield,<br>and uttered a loud shout. Having vanquished the ruler of the Sindhus,<br>Subhadra's son, that slayer of hostile heroes, then began to scorch that<br>division of the Kaurava army like Sun scorching the world. Then in that<br>battle Salya hurled at him a fierce dart made wholly of iron, decked with<br>gold, and resembling a blazing flame of fire. Thereupon, Arjuna's son,<br>jumping up, caught hold of that dart, like Garuda catching a mighty snake<br>falling from above. And having seized it thus, Abhimanyu unsheathed his<br>sword. Witnessing the great activity and might of that warrior of<br>immeasurable energy, all the kings together uttered a leonine shout. Then<br>that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the son of Subhadra, hurled with the<br>might of his arms at Salya himself that very dart of great effulgence,<br>decked with stones of lapis lazuli. Resembling a snake that has recently<br>cast off its slough, that dart, reaching Salya's car slew the latter's<br>driver and felled him from his niche of the vehicle. Then Virata and<br>Drupada, and Dhristaketu, and Yudhishthira, and Satyaki, and Kekaya, and<br>Bhima, and Dhrishtadyumna, and Sikhandin, and the twins (Nakula and<br>Sahadeva), and the five sons of Draupadi, all exclaimed, 'Excellent!<br>Excellent!' And diverse kinds of sounds due to the shooting of arrows,<br>and many leonine shouts, arose there, gladdening the unretreating son of<br>Arjuna. Thy sons, however, could not brook those indications of the<br>victory of their foe. Then all of them suddenly surrounded Subhadra's son<br>and covered him, O king, with showers of arrows like the clouds pouring<br>rain on the mountain-breast. Then that slayer of foes, viz., Artayani<br>(Salya), wishing good of thy sons, and remembering the overthrow of his<br>own driver, rushed in rage against Subhadra's son.'"
