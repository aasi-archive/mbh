                            "Sanjaya said, 'While Krishna and Daruka were thus conversing together,<br>that night, O king, passed away. (When morning dawned), king Yudhishthira<br>rose from his bed. Paniswanikas and Magadhas and Madhuparkikas and Sutas,<br>gratified that bull among men (with songs and music). And dancers began<br>their dance, and sweet-voiced singers sang their sweet songs fraught with<br>the praises of the Kuru race. And skilled musicians, well-trained (in<br>their respective instruments), played on Mridangas and Jharjharas and<br>Bheris, and Panavas, and Anakas, and Gomukhas, and Adamvaras, and conchs,<br>and Dundubhis of loud sound, and diverse other instruments. That loud<br>noise, deep as the roar of the clouds, touched the very heavens. And it<br>awoke that foremost of kings, viz., Yudhishthira, from his slumber.<br>Having slept happily on his excellent and costly bed, the king awoke.<br><br>And the monarch, rising from his bed, proceeded to the bath-room for<br>performing those acts that were absolutely necessary. Then a hundred and<br>eight servants, attired in white, themselves washed, and all young,<br>approached the king with many golden jars filled to the brim. Seated at<br>his ease on a royal seat, attired in a thin cloth, the king bathed in<br>several kinds of water fragrant with sandal-wood and purified with<br>Mantras. His body was rubbed by strong and well-trained servants with<br>water in which diverse kinds of medicinal herbs had been soaked. He then<br>washed with adhivasha water rendered fragrant by various odoriferous<br>substances. Obtaining then a long piece of cloth (for the head) that was<br>as white as the feathers of the swan, and that had been kept loose before<br>him, the king tied it round his head for drying the water. Smearing his<br>body then with excellent sandal-paste, and wearing floral garlands, and<br>addressing himself in clean robes, the mighty-armed monarch sat with face<br>towards the cast, and his hands joined together. Following the path of<br>the righteous, the son of Kunti then mentally said his prayers. And then<br>with great humility he entered the chamber in which the blazing fire (for<br>worship) was kept. And having worshipped the fire with faggots of sacred<br>wood and with libations of clarified butter sanctified with Mantras, he<br>came out of the chamber. Then that tiger among men, entering a second<br>chamber, beheld there many bulls among Brahmanas well-acquainted with the<br>Vedas. And they were all self-restrained, purified by the study of the<br>Vedas and by vows. And all of them had undergone the bath on the<br>completion of sacrifices performed by them. Worshippers of the Sun, they<br>numbered a thousand. And, besides them, there were also eight thousand<br>others of the same class. And the mighty-armed son of Pandu, having<br>caused them to utter, in distinct voices, agreeable benedictions, by<br>making presents to them of honey and clarified butter and auspicious<br>fruits of the best kind, gave unto each of them a nishka of gold, a<br>hundred steeds decked with ornaments, and costly robes and such other<br>presents as were agreeable to them. And making unto them presents also of<br>kine yielding milk whenever touched, with calves and having their horns<br>decked with gold and their hoofs with silver, the son of Pandu<br>circumambulated them. And then seeing and touching Swastikas fraught with<br>increase of good fortune, and Nandyavartas made of gold, and floral<br>garlands, water-pots and blazing fire, and vessels full of sun-dried rice<br>and other auspicious articles, and the yellow pigment prepared from the<br>urine of the cow, and auspicious and well-decked maidens, and curds and<br>clarified butter and honey, and auspicious birds and diverse other things<br>held sacred, the son of Kunti came into the outer chamber. Then, O<br>mighty-armed one, the attendants waiting in that chamber brought an<br>excellent and costly seat of gold that was of a circular shape. Decked<br>with pearls and lapis lazuli, and overlaid with a very costly carpet over<br>which was spread another cloth of fine texture, that scat was the<br>handiwork of the artificer himself. After the high-souled monarch had<br>taken his seat, the servants brought to him all his costly and bright<br>ornaments. The high-souled son of Kunti put on those begemmed ornaments,<br>whereupon his beauty became such as to enhance the grief of his foes. And<br>when the servants began to fan him with white yak-tails of the bright<br>effulgence of the moon and all furnished with handles of gold, the king<br>looked resplendent like a mass of clouds charged with lightning. And<br>bards began to sing his praises, and panegyrists uttered his eulogies.<br>And singers began to sing unto that delighter of Kuru's race, and in a<br>moment the voices of the panegyrists swelled into a loud noise. And then<br>was heard the clatter of car-wheels, and the tread of horse-hoofs. And in<br>consequence of that noise mingling with the tinkle of elephants' bells<br>and the blare of conchs and the tread of men, the very earth seemed to<br>tremble. Then one of the orderlies in charge of the doors, cased in mail,<br>youthful in years, decked with ear-rings, and his sword hanging by his<br>side, entering the private apartment, knelt down on the ground, and<br>saluting with (a bend of) his head the monarch who deserved every<br>adoration, represented unto that high-souled and royal son of Dharma that<br>Hrishikesa was waiting to be introduced. Then that tiger among men,<br>having ordered his servants, 'Let an excellent seat and an Arghya be kept<br>ready for him,' caused him of Vrishni's race to be introduced and seated<br>on a costly seat. And addressing Madhava with the usual enquiries of<br>welcome, king Yudhishthira the just duly worshipped Kesava.'
