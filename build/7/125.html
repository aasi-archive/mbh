                            "Sanjaya said, 'When the army of the Pandavas was thus agitated on all<br>sides, the Parthas and the Panchalas and the Somakas, retreated to a<br>great distance. During the progress of that fierce battle, making the<br>hair stand on end, and that universal carnage like to what happens, O<br>Bharata, at that end of the Yuga, when, indeed, Drona of great prowess<br>was repeatedly uttering leonine shouts, and when the Panchalas were being<br>weakened and the Pandavas slaughtered, king Yudhishthira the Just,<br>failing in that battle to find any refuge in that distress, began, O<br>king, to think how the matter would end. Casting his eyes around in<br>expectation of seeing Savyasachin, Yudhishthira, however, saw neither<br>that son of Pritha nor Madhava. Not seeing that tiger among men viz., the<br>ape-bannered Arjuna, and not hearing also the twang of Gandiva, the<br>monarch became filled with anxiety, not seeing Satyaki also, that<br>foremost of car-warriors among the Vrishnis, king Yudhishthira the Just<br>became equally anxious. Indeed, not seeing those two foremost of men,<br>Yudhishthira knew no peace. The high-souled king Yudhishthira the Just,<br>of mighty arms, fearing the evil opinion of the world, began to think of<br>Satyaki's car. Sini's grandson Satyaki, of true prowess, that dispeller<br>of the fears of friends, hath been sent by me in the track of Phalguna. I<br>had only one source of anxiety before, but now I have two. I should have<br>tidings of both Satyaki and Dhananjaya, the son of Pandu. Having<br>despatched Satyaki to follow in the track of Arjuna, whom shall I now<br>send in the track of Satyaki? If by every means I endeavour to obtain<br>intelligence of my brother only, without enquiring after Yuyudhana, the<br>world will reproach me. They will say that, 'Yudhishthira, the son of<br>Dharma, having enquired after his brother, leaves Satyaki of Vrishni's<br>race, that hero of unfailing prowess, to his fate!' Fearing, as I do, the<br>reproach of the world, I should therefore, send Vrikodara, the son of<br>Pritha, in the track of the high-souled Madhava. The love I bear to the<br>Vrishni hero, to that invincible warrior of the Satwata race, (viz.,<br>Satyaki), is not less than the love I bear to Arjuna, that slayer of<br>foes. The delighter of the Sinis hath again, been set by me to a very<br>heavy task. That mighty warrior, however, hath, either for the sake of a<br>friend's request or for that of honour, penetrated into the Bharata army<br>like a Makara into the ocean. Loud is the noise I hear of unretreating<br>heroes, fighting together against that Vrishni hero of great<br>intelligence. Without doubt, they are too many for him. The time,<br>therefore, is come when I should think of his rescue. It seems to me that<br>armed with the bow, Bhimasena, the son of Pandu, should go there where<br>those two mighty car-warriors are. There is nothing on earth that Bhima<br>cannot bear. If he struggles with resolution, he is a match in battle for<br>all the bowmen in the world. Depending on the might of his own arms, he<br>can stand against all foes. Relying on the strength of arms of that<br>high-souled warrior, we have been able to come back from our exile in the<br>woods and we have never been vanquished in battle. If Bhimasena, the son<br>of Pandu, proceedeth hence to Satyaki, both Satyaki and Phalguna will<br>derive real aid. Without doubt, I should not feel any anxiety for Satyaki<br>and Phalguna. Both of them are accomplished in weapons, and Vasudeva<br>himself is protecting them. (For all that, I feel anxious on their<br>account), I should certainly seek to remove my anxiety. I shall,<br>therefore, set Bhima to follow in the wake of Satyaki. Having done this,<br>I should regard my arrangements complete for the rescue of Satyaki.'<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma, having settled this in his mind,<br>addressed his charioteer and said, 'Take me to Bhima.' Hearing the<br>command of king Yudhishthira the Just, the charioteer who was versed in<br>horse-lore, took that car decked with gold to where Bhima was. Arrived at<br>the presence of Bhima, the king, remembering the occasion, became<br>unmanned by grief, and pressed Bhima with diverse solicitations. Indeed,<br>overwhelmed with grief, the monarch addressed Bhima. And these were the<br>words, O king, that Yudhishthira the son of Kunti then said unto him, 'O<br>Bhima, I do not behold the standard of that Arjuna, who on a single car<br>had vanquished all the gods, the Gandharvas and Asuras!' Then Bhimasena,<br>addressing king Yudhishthira the Just who was in that plight, said,<br>'Never before did I see, or hear thy 'Words afflicted with such<br>cheerlessness. Indeed, formerly, when we were smitten with grief, it was<br>thou who hadst been our comforter. Rise, Rise, O king of kings, say what<br>I am to do for thee. O giver of honours, there is nothing that I cannot<br>do. Tell me what your commands are, O foremost one of Kuru's race! Do not<br>set your heart on grief.' Unto Bhimasena then, the king with a sorrowful<br>face and with eyes bathed in tears, said, sighing the while like a black<br>cobra, 'The blasts of the conch Panchajanya, wrathfully blown by Vasudeva<br>of world-wide renown, are being heard. It seems, from this, that thy<br>brother Dhananjaya lieth today on the field, deprived of life. Without<br>doubt, Arjuna having been slain, Janardana is fighting. That hero of<br>great might, relying on whose prowess the Pandavas are alive, he to whom<br>we always turn in times of fear like the celestials towards their chief<br>of a thousand eyes, that hero hath, in search after the ruler of Sindhus,<br>penetrated into the Bharata host. I know this, O Bhima, viz., that he<br>hath gone, but he hath not yet returned. Dark in complexion, youthful in<br>years, of curly locks, exceedingly handsome mighty car-warrior, of broad<br>chest and long arms, possessed of the tread of an infuriated elephant, of<br>eyes of the colour of burnished copper and like those a chakra, that<br>brother of thine enhances the fears of foes. Blessed be thou, even this<br>is the cause of my grief, O chastiser of foes! For Arjuna's sake, O thou<br>of mighty arms, as also for the sake of Satwata, my grief increaseth like<br>a blazing fire fed with libations of clarified butter. I do not see his<br>standard. For this am I stupefied with sorrow. Without doubt, he hath<br>been slain, and Krishna, skilled in battle, is fighting. Know also that<br>the tiger among men, that mighty car-warrior, Satwata is slain. Alas!<br>Satyaki hath followed in the wake of that other mighty car-warrior, with<br>thy brother. Without seeing Satyaki also, I am stupefied by grief.<br>Therefore, O son of Kunti, go thither, where Dhananjaya is and Satyaki<br>also of mighty energy, if, of course, thou thinkest it thy duty to obey<br>my words, O thou that art acquainted with duty.' Remember that I am thy<br>eldest brother. Thou shouldst think Satyaki to be dearer to thee than<br>Arjuna himself. O son of Pritha, Satyaki hath gone, from desire of doing<br>good to me, in the track of Arjuna, a track that is incapable of being<br>trod by persons of vile souls. Beholding the two Krishnas and Satyaki<br>also of the Satwata race sound and whole, send me a message, O son of<br>Pandu, by uttering a leonine roar.'"
