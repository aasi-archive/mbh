                            "Sanjaya said, 'Having thus slain one of their foremost warriors, and<br>having been afflicted with their arrows, we came back to our encampment<br>in the evening, covered with blood. Steadfastly gazed at by the enemy, we<br>slowly left, O monarch, the field of battle, having sustained a severe<br>loss and nearly deprived of our senses. Then came that wonderful hour<br>intervening between day and night. Inauspicious howls of jackals were<br>heard. The sun, with the pale-red hue of the filaments of the<br>lotus,&#8212;sank low in the horizon, having approached the western hills. And<br>he took away with him the splendour of our swords and darts, rapiers and<br>car-fences, and shields and ornaments. Causing the firmament and the<br>earth to assume the same hue, the sun assumed his favourite form of fire.<br>The field of battle was strewn with the motionless bodies of innumerable<br>elephants deprived of life, Looking like crests of cloud-capped hills<br>riven by the thunder, and lying about with their standards and hooks and<br>riders fallen from their backs. The earth looked beautiful with large<br>cars crushed to pieces, and with their warriors and charioteers and<br>ornaments and steeds and standards and banners crushed, broken and torn.<br>Those huge cars, O king, looked like living creatures deprived of their<br>lives by the foe with his shafts. The field of battle assumed a fierce<br>and awful aspect in consequence of large number of steeds and riders all<br>lying dead, with costly trappings and blankets of diverse kinds scattered<br>about, and tongues and teeth and entrails and eyes of those creatures<br>bulging out of their places. Men decked with costly coats of mail and<br>ornaments and robes and weapons, deprived of life, lay with slain steeds<br>and elephants and broken cars, on the bare ground, perfectly helpless,<br>although deserving of costly beds and blankets. Dogs and jackals, and<br>crown and cranes and other carnivorous birds, and wolves and hyenas, and<br>ravens and other food-drinking creatures, all diverse tribes of<br>Rakshasas, and large number of Pisachas, on the field of battle, tearing<br>the skins of the corpse and drinking their fat, blood and marrow, began<br>to eat their flesh. And they began to suck also the secretions of rotten<br>corpses, while the Rakshasas laughed horribly and sang aloud, dragging<br>dead bodies numbering thousands. An awful river, difficult to cross, like<br>the Vaitarani itself, was caused there by foremost of warriors. Its<br>waters were constituted by the blood (of fallen creatures). Cars<br>constituted the rafts (or, which to cross it), elephants formed its<br>rocks, and the heads of human beings, its smaller stones. And it was miry<br>with the flesh (of slain steeds and elephants and men). And diverse kinds<br>of costly weapons constituted the garlands (floating on it or lying on<br>its banks). And that terrible river flowed fiercely through the middle of<br>the field of battle, wafting living creatures to the regions of the dead.<br>And large numbers of Pisachas, of horrible and repulsive forms, rejoiced,<br>drinking and eating in that stream. And dogs and jackals and carnivorous<br>birds, all eating of the same food, and inspiring living creatures with<br>terror, held their high carnival there. And the warriors, gazing on that<br>field of battle which, enhancing the population of Yama's domain,<br>presented such an awful sight, and where human corpses rising up, began<br>to dance, slowly left it as they beheld the mighty car-warrior Abhimanyu<br>who resembled Sakra himself, lying on the field, his costly ornaments<br>displaced and fallen off, and looking like a sacrificial fire on the<br>altar no longer drenched with clarified butter.'"
