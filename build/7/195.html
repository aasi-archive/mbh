                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Hearing, O Sanjaya, of the slaughter, by<br>unrighteous means, of his aged sire, by Dhrishtadyumna, what, did the<br>valiant Aswatthaman say, he, that is, in whom human and Varuna and Agneya<br>and Brahma and Aindra and Narayana weapons are always present? Indeed,<br>learning that the preceptor, that foremost of virtuous men, had been<br>unrighteously slain by Dhrishtadyumna in battle, what did Aswatthaman<br>say? The high-souled Drona, having obtained the science of weapons from<br>Rama have imparted (a knowledge of) all the celestial weapons unto his<br>son desirous of seeing the latter adorned with all the accomplishments<br>(of a warrior). There is only one person in this world, viz., the son,<br>and none else, whom people desire to become superior to themselves. All<br>high-souled preceptors have this characteristic, viz., that they impart<br>all the mysteries of their science unto either sons or devoted disciples.<br>Becoming his sire's pupil. O Sanjaya, and obtaining all those mysteries<br>with every detail, the son of Saradwat's daughter has become a second<br>Drona, and a great hero. Aswatthaman is equal to Karna in knowledge of<br>weapons, to Purandara in battle, to Kartavirya in energy, and Vrihaspati<br>in wisdom. In fortitude, that youth is equal to a mountain, and in energy<br>to fire. In gravity, he is equal to an ocean, and in wrath, to the poison<br>of the snake. He is the foremost of all car-warriors in battle, a firm<br>bowman, and above all fatigue. In speed he is equal to the wind itself<br>and he careens in the thick of fight like Yama in rage. While his engaged<br>in shooting arrows in battle, the very earth becomes afflicted. Of<br>prowess incapable of being baffled, hero is never fatigued by exertions.<br>Purified by the Vedas and by vows, he is a thorough master of the science<br>of arms, like Rama, the son of Dasharatha. He is like the ocean,<br>incapable of being agitated. Hearing that the preceptor, that foremost of<br>righteous persons, had been unrighteously slain in battle by<br>Dhrishtadyumna, what, indeed, did Aswatthaman say? Aswatthaman hath been<br>ordained to be the slayer of Dhrishtadyumna, even as Yajnasena's son, the<br>prince of the Panchalas, was ordained to be the slayer of Drona. What,<br>Oh, did Aswatthaman say, hearing that his sire, the preceptor, had been<br>slain by the cruel, sinful, and mean Dhrishtadyumna of little foresight?'"
