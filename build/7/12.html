                            "Sanjaya said, 'Yes, as I saw everything with my own eyes, I will<br>describe to thee how Drona fell down, slain by the Pandavas and the<br>Srinjayas. Having obtained the command of the troops, that mighty<br>car-warrior, viz., Bharadwaja's son, said these words unto thy son in the<br>midst of all the troops, 'Inasmuch as, O king, thou hast honoured me with<br>the command of the troops immediately after that bull among the Kauravas,<br>viz., the son of the Ocean-going (Ganga), take thou, O Bharata, the<br>adequate fruit of that act of thine. What business of thine shall I now<br>achieve? Ask thou the boon that thou desirest.' Then king Duryodhana<br>having consulted with Karna and Duhsasana and others, said unto the<br>preceptor, that invincible warrior and foremost of all victors, these<br>words, 'If thou wouldst give me a boon, then, seizing that foremost of<br>car-warriors, viz., Yudhishthira, alive, bring him unto me here.' Then<br>that preceptor of the Kurus, hearing those words of thy son, returned him<br>the following answer, gladdening all the troops therewith, Praised be<br>Kunti's son (Yudhishthira) whose seizing only thou desirest. O thou that<br>art difficult of being vanquished, thou askest not any other boon (one<br>for example) for his slaughter. For what reason, O tiger among men, dost<br>thou not desire his death? Thou art, without doubt, O Duryodhana, not<br>ignorant of policy. Why, therefore, dost thou not allude to Yudhisthira's<br>death? It is a matter of great wonder that king Yudhisthira, the just,<br>hath no enemy desirous of his death. Inasmuch as thou wishest him to be<br>alive, thou (either) seekest to preserve thy race from extinction, or, O<br>chief of the Bharatas, thou, having vanquished the Pandavas in battle,<br>art desirous of establishing brotherly relation (with them) by giving<br>them their kingdom. Auspicious was the birth of that intelligent prince.<br>Truly is he called Ajatasatru (the foeless one), for even thou bearest<br>affection for him.' Thus addressed by Drona, O Bharata, the feeling that<br>is ever present in thy son's breast suddenly made itself known. Not even<br>persons like Vrihaspati can conceal the expressions of their countenance.<br>For this, thy son, O king, filled with joy, said these words, 'By the<br>slaughter of Kunti's son in battle, O preceptor, victory cannot be mine.<br>If Yudhishthira were slain, Partha then, without doubt, would slay all of<br>us. All of them, again, cannot be slain by the very gods. He amongst them<br>that will, in that case, survive, will exterminate us. Yudhishthira,<br>however, is truthful in his promises. If brought hither (alive),<br>vanquished once more at dice, the Pandavas will once more go to the<br>woods, for they are all obedient to Yudhishthira. It is evident that such<br>a victory will be an enduring one. It is for this that I do not, by any<br>means, desire the slaughter of king Yudhishthira the just.' Ascertaining<br>this crooked purpose of Duryodhana, Drona who was conversant with the<br>truths of the science of profit and gifted with great intelligence,<br>reflected a little and gave him the boon circumscribing it in the<br>following way.'<br><br>"Drona said, 'If the heroic Arjuna do not protect Yudhishthira in battle,<br>thou mayst think the eldest Pandava as already brought under thy control.<br>As regards Partha, the very gods and the Asuras together headed by Indra,<br>cannot advance against him in battle. It is for this that I dare not do<br>what thou askest me to do. Without doubt, Arjuna is disciple, and I was<br>his first preceptor in arms. He is, however, young, endued with great<br>good fortune, and excessively intent (on the achievement of his<br>purposes). He hath obtained, again, many weapons from Indra and Rudra. He<br>hath besides been provoked by thee. I dare not, therefore, do what thou<br>askest me. Let Arjuna be removed, by whatsoever means that can be done,<br>from the battle. Upon Partha being withdrawn, thou mayst regard king<br>Yudhishthira as already vanquished. Upon his seizure is victory and not<br>upon his slaughter, O bull among men! Even by stratagem, can his seizure<br>be accomplished. Seizing that king devoted to truth and righteousness, I<br>will, without doubt, O monarch, bring him to thy control this very day,<br>if he stays before me in battle even for a moment, of course, if<br>Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, that tiger among men, be withdrawn from the<br>field. In Phalguni's presence, however, O king, Yudhishthira is incapable<br>of being taken in battle even by the gods and the Asuras headed by Indra.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'After Drona had promised the king's seizure even<br>under these limitations, thy foolish sons regarded Yudhishthira as<br>already taken. Thy son (Duryodhana) knew Drona's partiality for the<br>Pandavas. In order to make Drona stick to his promise, therefore, he<br>divulged those counsels. Then, O chastiser of foes, the fact of Drona's<br>having promised to seize the (eldest) Pandava was proclaimed by<br>Duryodhana unto all his troops.'"
