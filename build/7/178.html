                            "Sanjaya said, 'Seeing Bhima in that battle assailed by the cannibal,<br>Vasudeva, approaching Ghatotkacha, said unto him these words, 'Behold, O<br>mighty-armed one, Bhima is violently assailed by the Rakshasa in battle,<br>in the very sight of all the troops and of thyself, O thou of great<br>splendour! Abandoning Karna for the present, quickly slay Alayudha, O<br>mighty armed one! Thou can afterwards slay Karna.' Hearing these words of<br>him of Vrishni's race, the valiant Ghatotkacha, abandoning Karna,<br>encountered Alayudha, that prince of cannibals and brother of Vaka. The<br>battle then that took place at night between those two cannibals, viz.,<br>Alayudha and the son of Hidimva became fierce and dreadful, O Bharata.<br>Meanwhile, the mighty car-warrior Yuyudhana, and Nakula, and Sahadeva,<br>pierced with keen shafts the warriors of Alayudha, those terrible-looking<br>and heroic Rakshasas, armed with bows. The diadem-decked Vibhatsu, O<br>king, in that battle, shooting his arrows on all sides, began to<br>overthrow many foremost of Kshatriyas. Meanwhile, Karna, O king, in that<br>battle agitated many kings and many mighty car-warriors amongst the<br>Panchalas headed by Dhrishtadyumna and Sikhandin and others. Beholding<br>them slaughtered (by Karna), Bhima, of terrible prowess, rushed speedily<br>towards Karna, shooting his shafts in that battle. Then those warriors<br>also, viz., Nakula and Sahadeva and the mighty car-warrior,<br><br>Satyaki, having slain the Rakshasas, proceeded to that place where the<br>Suta's son was. All of them, then, began to fight with Karna, while the<br>Panchalas encountered Drona. Then Alayudha, excited with rage, struck<br>Ghatotkacha, that chastiser of foes, on the head, with a gigantic<br>Parigha. With the stroke of that Parigha, the mighty son of Bhimasena,<br>endued with great prowess, seemed to be in a state of partial swoon and<br>sat down motionless. Recovering consciousness, the latter, then, in that<br>encounter, hurled at his foe a gold-decked mace adorned with a hundred<br>bells and looking like a blazing fire. Hurled forcibly by that achiever<br>of fierce feats, that mace crushed into pieces the steeds, the driver,<br>and the loud-rattling car of Alayudha. Having recourse to illusion, the<br>latter, then, jumped down from that car of his, whose steeds and wheels<br>and Akshas and standard and Kuvara had all been crushed into pieces.<br>Relying on his illusion, he poured a copious shower of blood. The sky<br>then seemed to be overspread with a mass of black clouds adorned with<br>flashes of lightning. A thunder-storm was then heard, accompanied with<br>loud reports and loud roars of clouds. Loud sounds also of chat, chat,<br>were heard in that dreadful battle. Beholding that illusion created by<br>the Rakshasa Alayudha, the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha, soaring aloft, destroyed<br>it by means of his own illusion. Alayudha, beholding his own illusion<br>destroyed by that of his foe, began to pour a heavy shower of stones on<br>Ghatotkacha. That terrible shower of stones, the valiant Ghatotkacha<br>dispelled by means of a shower of arrows. They then rained on each other<br>diverse weapons, such as iron Parighas and spears and maces and short<br>clubs and mallets, and Pinakas and swords and lances and long spears and<br>Kampanas, and keen shafts, both long and broad-headed, and arrows and<br>discs and battle-axes, and Ayogudas and short-arrows, and weapons with<br>heads like those of kine, and Ulukhalas. And they struck each other,<br>tearing up many kinds of large-branched trees such as Sami and Pilu and<br>Karira and Champaka, O Bharata, and Inguidi and Vadari and flowering<br>Kovidara and Arimeda and Plaksha and banian and peepul, and also with<br>diverse mountain-summits and diverse kinds of metals. The clash of those<br>trees and mountain-summits became very loud like the roar of driving<br>thunder. Indeed, the battle that took place between Bhima's son and<br>Alayudha, was, O king, dreadful in the extreme, like that in days of old,<br>O monarch, between Vali and Sugriva, those two princes among the monkeys.<br>They struck each other with shafts and diverse other kinds of fierce<br>weapons, as also with sharp scimitars. Then the mighty Rakshasas, rushing<br>against each other, seized each other by the hair. And, O king, those two<br>gigantic warriors, with many wounds on their bodies and blood and sweat<br>trickling down, looked like two mighty masses of clouds pouring rain.<br>Then rushing with speed and whirling the Rakshasas on high and dashing<br>him down, Hidimva's son cut off his large head. Then taking that head<br>decked with a pair of ear-rings, the mighty Ghatotkacha uttered a loud<br>roar. Beholding the gigantic brother of Vaka, that chastiser of foes,<br>thus slain, the Panchalas and the Pandavas began to utter leonine shouts.<br>Then, upon the fall of the Rakshasa, the Pandavas beat and blew thousands<br>of drums and ten thousands of conchs. That night then clearly indicated<br>the victory of the Pandavas. Illumined with torches all around, and<br>resounding with the noise of musical instruments, the night looked<br>exceedingly resplendent. Then the mighty son of Bhimasena threw down the<br>head of the slain Alayudha before Duryodhana. Duryodhana, beholding the<br>heroic Alayudha slain, became, O Bharata, filled with anxiety, for all<br>his troops. Alayudha, having come to Duryodhana of his own accord.<br>remembering his former quarrel, had said unto him that he would slay<br>Bhima in battle. The Kuru king had regarded Bhima's slaughter to be<br>certain, and had believed that his brothers would all be long-lived.<br>Beholding that Alayudha slain by Bhimasena's son, the king regarded<br>Bhima's vow (about the slaughter of himself and his brothers) already<br>fulfilled.'"
