                            "Sanjaya said, 'Having slain Alayudha, the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha became<br>filled with delight. Standing at the head of the army he began to utter<br>diverse kinds of shouts. Hearing those loud roars of his that made<br>elephants tremble, a great fear, O monarch, entered into the hearts of<br>thy warriors. Beholding the mighty son of Bhimasena engaged with<br>Alayudha, the mighty-armed Karna rushed against the Panchalas. He pierced<br>Dhrishtadyumna and Sikhandin, each with ten strong and straight shafts<br>sped from his bow drawn to its fullest stretch. With a number of other<br>powerful shafts, the Suta's son then caused Yudhamanyu and Uttamaujas,<br>and the great car-warrior Satyaki to tremble. The bows of those warriors<br>also, O king, while they were engaged in striking Karna from all sides,<br>were seen to be drawn into circles. On that night, the twang of their<br>bow-strings and the rattle of their car-wheels (mingling together),<br>became loud and deep as the roar of the clouds at the close of summer.<br>The nocturnal battle, O monarch, resembled a gathering mass of clouds.<br>The twang of bow-string and the rattle of car-wheels constituted its<br>roar. The bows (of warriors) constituted its lightning flashes; and<br>showers of shafts formed its downpour of rain. Standing immovable like a<br>hill and possessed of the strength of a prince of mountains, that grinder<br>of foes, viz., Vikartana's son, Karna, O king, destroyed that wonderful<br>shower of arrows shot at him. Devoted to the good of thy sons, the<br>high-souled Vaikartana, in the battle, began to strike his foes with<br>lances endued with the force of thunder, and with whetted shafts,<br>equipped with beautiful wings of gold. Soon the standard of some were<br>broken and cut down by Karna, and the bodies of others pierced and<br>mangled by him with keen arrows; and soon some were deprived of drivers,<br>and some of their steeds. Exceedingly afflicted by the Suta's son in that<br>battle, many of them entered the force of Yudhishthira. Beholding them<br>broken and compelled to retreat, Ghatotkacha became mad with rage.<br>Mounted on that excellent car of his that was decked with gold and<br>jewels, he uttered a leonine roar and approaching Vikartana's son, Karna,<br>pierced him with shafts endued with the force of thunder. Both of them<br>began to cover the welkin with barbed arrows, and cloth-yard shafts, and<br>frog-faced arrows, and Nalikas and Dandas and Asanis and arrows bearing<br>heads like the calf's tooth or the boar's ear, and broad-headed shafts,<br>and shafts pointed like horns, and others bearing heads like razors. The<br>welkin, covered with that arrowy shower, looked, in consequence of those<br>gold-winged shafts of blazing splendour coursing horizontally through it,<br>as if hung with garland of beautiful flowers. Each endued with prowess<br>equal to that of the other, they struck each other equally with powerful<br>weapons. None could, in that battle, find any mark of superiority in<br>either of those excellent heroes. Indeed, that battle between the son of<br>Surya and Bhima's son, characterised by a thick and heavy shower of<br>weapons, looked exceedingly beautiful and presented almost an unrivalled<br>sight like the fierce encounter between Rahu and Surya in the welkin.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'When Ghatotkacha, O king, that foremost of all<br>persons conversant with weapons, found that he could not prevail over<br>Karna, he invoked into existence a fierce and mighty weapon. With that<br>weapon, the Rakshasa first slew the steeds of Karna and then the latter's<br>driver. Having achieved that feat, Hidimva's son quickly made himself<br>invisible.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'When the Rakshasa fighting by deceitful means thus<br>disappeared, tell me, O Sanjaya, what the warriors of my army thought.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, Seeing the Rakshasa disappear, all the Kauravas loudly<br>said, Appearing next, the Rakshasa, fighting deceitfully, will certainly<br>slay Karna.' Then Karna, endued with wonderful lightness in the use of<br>weapons, covered all sides with showers of shafts. The welkin being<br>covered with the darkness caused by that thick arrowy shower, all<br>creatures became invincible. So great was the lightness of hand displayed<br>by the Suta's son, that none could mark when he touched his quivers with<br>his fingers, when he fixed his arrows on the bowstring, and when he aimed<br>and sped them off. The entire welkin seemed to be shrouded with his<br>arrows. Then a fierce and terrible illusion was invoked into existence by<br>the Rakshas in the welkin. We beheld in the sky what appeared to us to be<br>a mass of red clouds resembling the fierce flame of a blazing fire. From<br>that cloud issued flashes of lightning, and many blazing brands, O Kuru<br>king! And tremendous roars also issued therefrom, like the noise of<br>thousands of drums beat at once. And from it fell many shafts winged with<br>gold, and darts, lances and heavy clubs, and other similar weapons, and<br>battle-axes, and scimitars washed with oil, and axes of blazing edges,<br>and spears, and spiked maces emitting shining rays, and beautiful maces<br>of iron, and long darts of keen points, and heavy maces decked with gold<br>and twined round with string's, and Sataghnis, all around. And large<br>rocks fell from it, and thousands of thunderbolts with loud report, and<br>many hundreds of wheels and razors of the splendour of fire. Karna<br>shooting showers of shafts, failed to destroy that thick and blazing<br>downpour of darts and lances and clubs. Loud became the uproar then of<br>falling steeds slain by those shafts, and mighty elephants struck with<br>thunder, and great car-warriors deprived of life by other weapons.<br>Afflicted by Ghatotkacha with that terrible shower of arrows all around,<br>that host of Duryodhana was seen to wander in great pain over the field.<br>With cries of Oh and Alas, and exceedingly cheerless, that wandering host<br>seemed on the point of being annihilated. The leaders, however, in<br>consequence of the nobility of their hearts, fled not away with faces<br>turned from the field. Beholding that exceedingly frightful and awful<br>shower of mighty weapons, caused by the Rakshasa's illusion, failing upon<br>the field, and seeing their vast army incessantly slaughtered, the sons<br>became inspired with great fear. Hundreds of jackals with tongues blazing<br>like fire and terrible yells, began to cry. And, O king, the (Kaurava)<br>warriors beholding the yelling Rakshasas, became exceedingly distressed.<br>Those terrible Rakshasas with fiery tongues and blazing mouths and sharp<br>teeth, and with forms huge as hills, stationed in the welkin, with darts<br>in grasp looked like clouds pouring torrents of rain. Struck and crushed<br>with those fierce shafts and darts and lances and maces and spiked clubs<br>of blazing splendour; and thunder-bolts and Pinakas and Asanis and disci<br>and Sataghnis, the (Kaurava) troops began to fall down. The Rakshasas<br>began to pour upon the warriors of thy son long darts, and treacle and<br>Sataghnis, and Sthunas made of black iron and twined with strings of<br>jute. Then all the combatants became stunned. Brave warriors, with<br>weapons broken or loosened from their grasp, or deprived of heads, or<br>with fractured limbs began to fall down on the field. And in consequence<br>of the failing rocks, steeds and elephants and cars began to be crushed.<br>Those Yatudhanas of terrible forms created by Ghatotkacha with the aid of<br>his powers of illusion pouring that thick shower of mighty weapons spared<br>neither those that were terrified nor those that begged for quarter.<br>During that cruel carnage of Kuru heroes, brought on by Death himself,<br>during that extermination of Kshatriyas the Kaurava warriors suddenly<br>broke and fled with speed, crying aloud, 'Fly, ye Kauravas! All is lost!<br>The gods Indra at their head are slaying us for the sake of the<br>Pandavas!' At that time there was none that could rescue the sinking<br>Bharata troops. During that fierce uproar and rout and extermination of<br>the Kauravas, the camps losing their distinctive features, the parties<br>could not be distinguished from each other. Indeed, during that terrible<br>rout in which the soldiers showed no regard for one another, every side<br>of the field, when looked at, seemed to be empty. Only Karna, O king,<br>could be seen there, drowned in that shower of weapons. Then Karna<br>covered the welkin with his shafts, contending with that celestial<br>illusion of the Rakshasa. The Suta's son, endued with modesty and<br>achieving the most difficult and noble feats, did not lose his senses in<br>that battle. Then, O king, all the Saindhavas and Valhikas affrightedly<br>looked at Karna who kept his senses in that fight. And they all<br>worshipped him, while they looked at the triumph of the Rakshasa. Then a<br>Sataghni equipped with wheels, hurled by Ghatotkacha, slew the four<br>steeds of Karna simultaneously. These. dropped down on the ground, on<br>their knees, deprived of life, teeth, eyes, and tongues. Then jumping<br>down from his steedless car and seeing the Kauravas flying away, and<br>beholding his own celestial weapon baffled by the Rakshasa illusion,<br>Karna, without losing his senses, turned his mind inwards and began to<br>reflect on what he should next do. At that time all the Kauravas,<br>beholding Karna and that terrible illusion (of the Rakshasa) cried out<br>saying, 'O Karna, slay the Rakshasa soon with thy dart. These Kauravas<br>and the Dhartarashtras are on the point of being annihilated. What will<br>Bhima and Arjuna do to us? Slay this wretched Rakshasa at dead of night,<br>who is consuming us all. They that will escape from this dreadful<br>encounter to-day will fight with the Parthas in battle. Therefore, slay<br>this terrible Rakshas now with that dart given thee by Vasava. O Karna,<br>let not these great warriors, the Kauravas, these princes that resemble<br>Indra himself, be all destroyed in this nocturnal battle.' Then Karna,<br>seeing the Rakshasa alive at dead of night, and the Kuru army struck with<br>fear, and hearing also the loud wails of the latter set his heart upon<br>hurling his dart. Inflamed with rage like a wrathful lion and unable to<br>brook the assaults of the Rakshasa, Karna took up that foremost of<br>victory-giving and invincible darts, desirous of compassing the<br>destruction of Ghatotkacha. Indeed, that dart, O king, which he had kept<br>and adored for years for (achieving) the slaughter of Pandu's son in<br>battle, that foremost of darts which Sakra himself had given to the<br>Suta's son in exchange for the latter's ear-rings, that blazing and<br>terrible missile twined with strings and which seemed to thirst for<br>blood, that fierce weapon which looked like the very tongue of the<br>Destroyer or the sister of Death himself, that terrible and effulgent<br>dart, Naikartana, was now hurled at the Rakshasa. Beholding that<br>excellent and blazing weapon capable of piercing the body of every foe,<br>in the hands of the Suta's son, the Rakshasa began to fly away in fear<br>assuming a body gigantic as the foot of the Vindhya mountains. Indeed,<br>seeing that dart in Karna's hand, all creatures in the sky, O king,<br>uttered loud cries. Fierce winds began to blow, and thunders with loud<br>report began to fall on the earth. Destroying that blazing illusion of<br>Ghatotkacha and piercing right through his breast that resplendent dart<br>soared aloft in the night and entered a starry constellation in the<br>firmament. Having fought, using diverse beautiful weapons, with many<br>heroic Rakshasa and human warriors, Ghatotkacha, then uttering diverse<br>terrible roars, fell, deprived of life with that dart of Sakra. This also<br>is another exceedingly wonderful feat that the Rakshasa accomplished for<br>the destruction of his foes, that at a time when his heart was pierced by<br>that dart, he shone resplendent, O king, like a mighty mountain or a mass<br>of clouds. Indeed, having assumed that terrible and awful form,<br>Bhimasena's son of frightful deeds fell down. When dying, O king, he fell<br>upon a portion of thy army and pressed those troops down by the weight of<br>his own body. Quickly falling down, the Rakshasa with his gigantic and<br>still increasing body, desirous of benefiting the Pandavas, slew a full<br>Akshauhini of thy troops while he himself breathed his last. Then a loud<br>uproar arose there made up of leonine shouts and blare of conchs and the<br>beat of drums and cymbals. The Kauravas indeed, beholding the illusion of<br>the Rakshasa destroyed and the Rakshasa himself slain uttered loud shouts<br>of joy. Then Karna, worshipped by the Kurus as Sakra had been by the<br>Maruts upon the slaughter of Vritra, ascended behind the car of thy son,<br>and becoming the observed of all, entered the Kuru host.'"
