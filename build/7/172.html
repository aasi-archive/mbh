                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding his own army routed while being slaughtered by<br>those illustrious heroes, thy son, well-acquainted with words, O monarch,<br>quickly repairing unto Karna and Drona, that foremost of all victors in<br>battle, wrathfully said these words, 'This battle has been set on foot by<br>you two in rage, having seen the ruler of the Sindhus slain by<br>Savyasachin. You are beholding with indifference the slaughter of my army<br>by the forces of the Pandavas, although you two are fully competent to<br>vanquish those forces. If you two now abandon me, you should have, in the<br>beginning, told me of it, 'We two shall vanquish the sons of Pandu in<br>battle.' Even these were the words, ye givers of honours, that ye then<br>said unto me. Hearing these words of yours, I sanctioned these<br>proceedings. I would never have provoked these hostilities with the<br>Parthas,&#8212;hostilities that are so destructive of heroic combatants (if ye<br>had told me otherwise). If I do not deserve to be abandoned by you two,<br>ye bulls among men, then fight according to the true measure of your<br>prowess, ye heroes endued with great prowess.' Thus pierced by the goad<br>of speech of thy son, those two heroes once more engaged in battle, like<br>two snakes vexed with sticks. Then those two foremost of car-warriors,<br>those two bowmen above all bowmen in the world, rushed with speed against<br>the Parthas headed by the grandson of Sini and by others. Similarly, the<br>Parthas uniting together, and accompanied by all their troops, advanced<br>against those two heroes, who were roaring repeatedly. Then the great<br>bowman, Drona, that foremost of all wielders of weapons, excited with<br>rage, quickly pierced (Satyaki), that bull amongst the Sinis, with ten<br>arrows. And Karna pierced him with ten arrows, and thy son with seven,<br>and Vrishasena pierced him with ten, and Suvala's son with seven. In that<br>impervious wall of Kauravas around the grandson of Sini, these also<br>stationed themselves, encompassing him. Beholding Drona slaughtering the<br>Pandava army in that battle, the Somakas quickly pierced him from every<br>side with showers of arrows. Then Drona began to take the lives of<br>Kshatriyas, O monarch, like the sun destroying darkness around him by his<br>rays. We then heard, O monarch, a loud uproar amongst the Panchalas, who<br>called upon one another, while they were being slaughtered by Drona. Some<br>abandoning sons, some sires, some brothers, some uncles, some their<br>sister's sons, some their relatives and kinsmen, fled away with speed,<br>for saving their own lives. Some, again, deprived of their senses, ran<br>against Drona himself. Indeed, many were the combatants of the Pandava<br>army that were then despatched to the other world. Thus afflicted by that<br>illustrious hero, the Pandava host, that night, O king, fled away,<br>throwing down their blazing torches all around, in the very sight of<br>Bhimasena and Arjuna and Krishna and the twins and Yudhishthira and<br>Prishata's son. The world being enveloped in darkness, nothing could be<br>seen. In consequence of the light that was amongst the Katirava troops,<br>the flight of the foe could be ascertained. Those mighty car-warriors,<br>viz., Drona and Karna, O king, pursued the flying host, scattering<br>numerous shafts. Seeing the Panchalas slaughtered and routed, Janardana<br>becoming cheerless, said these words unto Phalguna, 'Dhrishtadyumna and<br>Satyaki, accompanied by the Panchalas, had proceeded against those great<br>bowmen, viz., Drona and Karna, shooting many shafts. This large host of<br>ours hath been broken and routed (by them) with showers of arrows. Though<br>their flight is sought to be checked, they are still incapable of being<br>rallied, O son of Kunti!&#8212;Beholding the host fly away, through fear, ye<br>Pandava warriors, cast away your fears! Accompanied by all the forces and<br>arraying then, in good order, both of us, with uplifted weapons, are even<br>now proceeding against Drona and the Suta's son for withstanding them.'<br>Then Janardana beholding Vrikodara advancing, once more addressed Arjuna,<br>the son of Pandu, as if for gladdening him, in these words, 'Yonder<br>Bhima, who taketh delight in battle, surrounded by the Somakas and the<br>Pandavas, is coming against those mighty car-warriors, viz., Drona and<br>Karna. Supported by him, as also by the many mighty car-warriors among<br>the Pandavas, fight now, O son of Pandu, for assuring all your<br>troops.'[228] Then those two tigers among men, viz., the son of Pandu and<br>he of Madhu's race, approaching Drona and Karna, took up their station at<br>the head of battle.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Then that vast force of Yudhishthira once more<br>returned to battle, proceeding to the place where Drona and Karna were<br>grinding their foes in battle. At dead of night, a fierce encounter took<br>place, resembling that of two oceans swelling at moon-rise. Then the<br>warriors of thy army, throwing away from their hands the blazing lamps<br>held by them, fought with the Pandavas fearlessly and madly. On that<br>terrible night when the world was enveloped with gloom and dust, the<br>combatants fought with one another, guided only by the names they<br>uttered. The names uttered by the kings contending in battle, were heard,<br>O monarch, there, like what happens, O king, at a Swayamvara or<br>self-choice. Suddenly, a silence overspread the field of battle, and<br>lasted for a moment. Then, again, a loud uproar was heard made by the<br>angry combatants, victors and vanquished. Thither where blazing lamps<br>were seen, O bull of Kuru's race, thither rushed those heroes like<br>insects (towards a blazing fire). And as the Pandavas, O king, and the<br>Kauravas, contended with each other in battle, the darkness of night<br>thickened around them.'"
