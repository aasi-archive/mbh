                            "Sanjaya said, 'When the ruler of the Sindhus checked the Pandavas,<br>desirous of success, the battle that took place then between thy troops<br>and the enemy became awful. The invincible son of Arjuna, of sure aim and<br>mighty energy, having penetrated in the (Kaurava) array agitated it like<br>a Makara agitating the ocean. Against that chastiser of foes then, viz.,<br>the son of Subhadra, who was thus agitating the hostile host with his<br>arrowy showers, the principal warriors of the Kaurava army rushed, each<br>according to his rank and precedence. The clash between them of<br>immeasurable energy, scattering their arrowy showers with great force, on<br>the one side and Abhimanyu alone on the other, became awful. The son, of<br>Arjuna, encompassed on all sides by those enemies with crowds of cars,<br>slew the charioteer of Vrishasena and also cut off his bow. And the<br>mighty Abhimanyu then pierced Vrishasena's steeds with his straight<br>shafts, upon which those coursers, with the speed of the wind, bore<br>Vrishasena away from the battle. Utilizing that opportunity, Abhimanyu's<br>charioteer freed his car from that press by taking it away to another<br>part of the field. Those numerous car-warriors then, (beholding this<br>feat) were filled with joy and exclaimed, 'Excellent! Excellent!' Seeing<br>the lion-like Abhimanyu angrily slaying the foe with his shafts and<br>advancing from a distance. Vasatiya, proceeding towards him quickly fell<br>upon him with great force. The latter pierced Abhimanyu with sixty shafts<br>of golden wings and addressing him, said, 'As long as I am alive, thou<br>shalt not escape with life.' Cased though he was in an iron coat of mail,<br>the son of Subhadra pierced him in the chest with a far-reaching shaft.<br>Thereupon Vasatiya fell down on the earth, deprived of life. Beholding<br>Vasatiya slain, many bulls among Kshatriyas became filled with wrath, and<br>surrounded thy grandson, O king, from a desire of slaying him. They<br>approached him, stretching their countless bows of diverse kinds, and the<br>battle then that took place between the son of Subhadra and his foes was<br>exceedingly fierce. Then the son of Phalguni, filled with wrath, cut off<br>their arrows and bows, and diverse limbs of their bodies, and their heads<br>decked with ear-rings and floral garlands. And arms were seen lopped off,<br>that were adorned with various ornaments of gold, and that Still held<br>scimitars and spiked maces and battle-axes and the fingers of which were<br>still cased in leathern gloves. [And the earth became strewn][71] with<br>floral wreaths and ornaments and cloths, with fallen standards, with<br>coats of mail and shields and golden chains and diadems and umbrellas and<br>yak-tails; with Upashkaras and Adhishthanas, and Dandakas, and Vandhuras<br>with crushed Akshas, broken wheels, and yokes, numbering thousands,[72]<br>with Anukarashas, and banners, and charioteers, and steeds; as also with<br>broken cars, and elephants, and steeds. The field of battle, strewn with<br>slain Kshatriyas endued (while living) with great heroism,&#8212;rulers of<br>diverse realms, inspired with desire of victory,&#8212;presented a fearful<br>sight. When Abhimanyu angrily careered over the field of battle in all<br>directions, his very form became invisible. Only his coat of mail, decked<br>with gold, his ornaments, and bow and shafts, could be seen. Indeed,<br>while he slew the hostile warriors by means of his shafts, staying in<br>their midst like the sun himself in his blazing effulgence, none could<br>gaze at him with his eyes.'"
