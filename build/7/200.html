                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then Drona's son began to cause a great carnage amongst<br>his foes in that battle, like the Destroyer himself at the end of the<br>Yuga. Slaying his enemies by means of his broad-headed arrows,<br>Aswatthaman soon piled a mountain there of the dead. The standards of<br>cars formed its trees; and weapons its pointed summits; the lifeless<br>elephants formed its large rocks; the steeds, its Kimpurushas; and bows,<br>its creepers and plants. And it resounded with the cries of all<br>carnivorous creatures, that constituted its feathery population. And the<br>spirits that walked there formed its Yakshas[266]. Then roaring aloud, O<br>bull of Bharata's race, Aswatthaman once more repeated his vow in the<br>hearing of thy son, thus, 'Since Kunti's son, Yudhishthira, assuming only<br>the outward garb of virtue, had caused the preceptor who was<br>(righteously) engaged in battle to lay aside his weapons, I shall, in his<br>very sight, rout and destroy his army. Having mangled all his troops, I<br>shall, then, slay the sinful prince of the Panchalas. Indeed, I shall<br>slay all of them, if they contend with me in battle. I tell thee truly,<br>therefore, rally thou thy troops.' Hearing these words of Aswatthaman,<br>thy son rallied the troops, having dispelled their fears with a loud<br>leonine, roar. The encounter, then, O king, that once more took place<br>between the Kuru and the Pandava armies, became as terrible as that of<br>two oceans at full tide. The terrified Kauravas had their fears dispelled<br>by Drona's son. The Pandus and the Panchalas had become fierce in<br>consequence of Drona's slaughter. Great was the violence of that<br>collision, on the field of battle, between those warriors, all of whom<br>were cheerful and filled with rage and inspired with certain hopes of<br>victory. Like a mountain, striking against a mountain, or an ocean<br>against an ocean, O monarch, was that collision between the Kurus and the<br>Pandavas. Filled with joy, the Kuru and the Pandava warriors beat<br>thousands of drums. The loud and stunning uproar that arose from among<br>those troops resembled that of the ocean itself while churned (of old by<br>the gods and the Danavas). Then Drona's son, aiming at the host of the<br>Pandavas and the Panchalas, invoked the weapon called Narayana. Then<br>thousands of arrows with blazing mouths appeared in the welkin,<br>resembling snakes of fiery mouths, that continued to agitate the<br>Pandavas. In that dreadful battle, those shafts, O king, like the very<br>rays of the sun in a moment shrouded all the points of the compass, the<br>welkin, and the troops. Innumerable iron balls also, O king, then<br>appeared, like resplendent luminaries in the clear firmament. Sataghnis,<br>some equipped with four and some with two wheels, and innumerable maces,<br>and discs, with edges sharp as razor and resplendent like the sun, also<br>appeared there. Beholding the welkin densely shrouded with those weapons,<br>O bull of Bharata's race, the Pandavas, the Panchalas, and the Srinjayas,<br>became exceedingly agitated. In all those places, O ruler of men, where<br>the great car-warriors of the Pandavas contended in battle, that weapon<br>became exceedingly powerful. Slaughtered by the Narayana weapon, as if<br>consumed by a conflagration, the Pandava troops were exceedingly<br>afflicted all over the field in that battle. Indeed, O lord, as fire<br>consumeth a heap of dry grass in summer, even so did that weapon consume<br>the army of the Pandus. Beholding that weapon filling every side, seeing<br>his own troops destroyed in large numbers, king Yudhishthira the just, O<br>lord, became inspired with great fright. Seeing his army in course of<br>flight and deprived of its senses, and beholding Parthas standing<br>indifferent, Dharma's son said these words, 'O Dhrishtadyumna, fly away<br>with your Panchala troops. O Satyaki, you also go away, surrounded by the<br>Vrishnis and the Andhakas. Of virtuous soul, Vasudeva will himself seek<br>the means of his own safety. He is competent to offer advice to the whole<br>world. What need is there of telling him what he should do? We should not<br>any longer fight. I say so unto all the troops. As regards myself, I<br>will, with all my brothers ascend a funeral pile. Having crossed the<br>Bhishma and the Drona oceans in this battle, that are incapable of being<br>crossed by the timid, shall I sink with all my followers in the vestige,<br>represented by Drona's son, of a cow's hoof? Let the wishes of king<br>Duryodhana be crowned with success today, for I have today slain in<br>battle the preceptor, that always cherished such friendly feelings<br>towards us, that preceptor, who, without protecting, caused that child<br>unacquainted with battle, viz., the son of Subhadra, to be slain by a<br>multitude of wicked warriors, that preceptor, who with his son, sat<br>indifferently, without answering, when Krishna in such distress, dragged<br>into the assembly and sought to be made a slave, asked him to say the<br>truth, that preceptor, who, white all the other warriors were fatigued,<br>cased Duryodhana in invulnerable armour when the latter desired to slay<br>Phalguna and who, having cased him so, appointed him to protect<br>Jayadratha, who, being acquainted with the Brahma weapon, scrupled not to<br>exterminate the Panchalas, headed by Satyajit, that had exerted<br>themselves for my victory, that preceptor, who, whilst we were being<br>unrighteously exiled from our kingdom, freely told us to go into the<br>woods although he had been solicited by our friends to withhold his<br>permission[267]. Alas, that great friend of our hath been slain! For his<br>sake, I will, with my friends, lay down my life. After Kunti's son,<br>Yudhishthira had said this, he of Dasarha's race, (viz., Kesava) quickly<br>forbidding the troops, by motion of his arms, to fly away said these<br>words, Speedily lay down your weapons, all of you, and alight from your<br>vehicles. Even this is the means ordained by the illustrious one, (viz.,<br>Narayana himself) for baffling this weapon. Come down on the earth, all<br>of you from your elephants and steeds and cars. If you stand weaponless<br>on the earth, this weapon will not slay you. In those places where you<br>will fight for quelling the force of this weapon the Kauravas will become<br>more powerful than you. Those men, however, that will throw down their<br>weapons and alight from their vehicles, will not in this battle, be slain<br>by this weapon. They, however, that will, even in imagination, contend<br>against this weapon, will all be slain even if they seek refuge deep<br>beneath the earth'. The warriors of the Pandava army, hearing, O Bharata,<br>these words of Vasudeva, threw their weapons and drove away from their<br>hearts all desire of battle. Then Bhimasena, the son of Pandu, beholding<br>the warriors about to abandon their weapons, said these words, O king,<br>gladdening them all: 'None should lay down his weapons here. I shall,<br>with my shafts, oppose this weapon of Drona's son. With this heavy mace<br>of mine, that is decked with gold, I shall career in this battle like the<br>Destroyer himself, quelling this weapon of Drona's son. There is no man<br>here that is equal to me in prowess, even as there is no luminary in the<br>firmament that is equal to the sun. Beholding these two strong arms of<br>mine like unto the trunks of a couple of mighty elephants, capable of<br>pulling down the mountain of Himavat. I am the one person here that<br>possesses the might of the thousand elephants. I am without a peer, even<br>as Sakra is known to be in heaven among the celestials. Let people<br>witness today the prowess of these two arms of my broad-chested self,<br>while engaged in baffling the bright and blazing weapon of Drona's son.<br>If there be none (else) capable of contending against the Narayana<br>weapon, even I shall contend against it today in the very sight of all<br>the Kurus and the Pandavas. O Arjuna, O Vibhatsu, thou shouldst not lay<br>Gandiva aside. A stain will then attach to thee like that of the moon.'<br>Thus addressed Bhima, Arjuna said, O Bhima, even this is my great vow,<br>viz., that my Gandiva shall not be used against the Narayana weapon,<br>kine, and Brahmanas. Thus answered by Arjuna, Bhima, that chastiser of<br>foes, riding on his car of solar effulgence, whose rattle, besides,<br>resembled the roar of the clouds, rushed against the son of Drona. Endued<br>with great energy and prowess, the son of Kunti, in consequence of his<br>extreme lightness of hand, within the twinkling of an eye, covered<br>Aswatthaman with a shower of weapons. Then Drona's son, smiling at the<br>rushing Bhima and addressing him (in proper words) covered him with<br>arrows, inspired with mantras and equipped with blazing points. Shrouded<br>with those shafts that vomited fire and resembled snakes of blazing<br>mouths, as if covered with sparks of gold. The form, O king, of Bhimasena<br>in that battle looked like that of a mountain in the evening when covered<br>with fire. That weapon of Drona's son, directed against Bhimasena<br>increased in energy and might, O king, like a conflagration assisted by<br>the wind. Beholding that weapon of terrible energy thus increasing in<br>might, a panic entered the hearts of all the combatants of the Pandava<br>army with the exception of Bhima. Then all of them, throwing down their<br>weapons on the earth, alighted from their cars and steeds. After they had<br>thrown their weapons and alighted from their vehicles, that weapon of<br>exceeding energy fell upon the head of Bhima. All creatures, especially<br>the Pandavas, uttered cries of Oh and Alas, beholding Bhimasena<br>overwhelmed by the energy of that weapon.'"
