                            "Sanjaya said, 'Kshemadhurti, O monarch, pierced the advancing<br>Vrihatkshatra of great valour, that prince of the Kaikeyas, with many<br>arrows in the chest. King Vrihatkshatra then, O monarch, desirous of<br>piercing through Drona's division, quickly struck his antagonist with<br>ninety straight shafts. Kshemadhurti, however, filled with rage, cut off,<br>with a sharp well-tempered, and broad-headed shaft, the bow of that<br>high-souled prince of the Kaikeyas. Having cut off his bow, Kshemadhurti<br>then, with a keen and straight shaft, quickly pierced in that encounter<br>that foremost of all bowmen. Then Vrihatkshatra, taking up another bow<br>and smiling (at his foe), soon made the mighty car-warrior Kshemadhurti<br>steedless and driverless and carless. And with another broad-headed shaft<br>that was well-tempered and sharp, he cut off, from the trunk of his royal<br>antagonist his head blazing with (a pair of) ear-rings. That head, graced<br>with only locks and a diadem, suddenly cut off, fell down on the earth<br>and looked resplendent like a luminary fallen from the firmament. Having<br>slain his foe, the mighty car-warrior Vrihatkshatra became filled with<br>joy and fell with great force upon thy troops for the sake of the<br>Parthas. The great bowman Viradhanwan, O Bharata, endued with great<br>prowess, resisted Dhrishtaketu who was advancing against Drona.<br>Encountering each other, those two heroes having arrows for their fangs,<br>and both endued with great activity, struck each other with many<br>thousands of arrows. Indeed, those two tigers among men fought with each<br>other, like two leaders of elephantine herds in the deep woods with fury.<br>Both endued with great energy, they fought, each desirous of slaying the<br>other, like two enraged tigers in a mountain-cave. That combat, O<br>monarch, became exceedingly fierce. Deserving to be witnessed, it became<br>highly wonderful. The very Siddhas and the Charanas, in large numbers,<br>witnessed it with wonder-waiting eyes. Then Viradhanwan, O Bharata, with<br>a laugh, cut off in rage Dhrishtaketu's bow in twain by means of<br>broad-headed arrows. Abandoning that broken bow, the ruler of the Chedis,<br>that mighty car-warrior took up a fierce dart made of iron and equipped<br>with a golden staff. Bending with his hands, O Bharata, that dart of<br>fierce energy towards the car of Viradhanwan, Dhrishtaketu hurled it<br>carefully and with great force. Struck with great force by that<br>hero-slaying dart, and his heart pierced by it through, Viradhanwan,<br>quickly fell down on the earth from his car. Upon the fall of that hero,<br>that mighty car-warrior among the Trigartas, thy army, O lord, was broken<br>by the Pandavas. (Thy son) Durmukha sped sixty shafts at Sahadeva, and<br>uttered a loud shout in that battle, challenging that son of Pandu. The<br>son of Madri, then., filled with rage, pierced Durmukha with many keen<br>arrows, smiling the while, the brother striking the brother. Be. holding<br>the mighty Durmukha fighting furiously, Sahadeva, then, O Bharata, once<br>more struck him with nine shafts. Endued with great strength, Sahadeva<br>then cut off Durmukha's standard with a broad-headed arrow and struck<br>down his four steeds with four other arrows. And then with another broad.<br>headed arrow, well-tempered and sharp, he cut off, from his trunk, the<br>head of Durmukha's charioteer that shone with a pair of ear-rings. And<br>cutting off Durmukha's large bow with a razor-faced arrow, Sahadeva<br>pierced Durmukha himself in that battle with five arrows. Durmukha<br>fearlessly jumping down from that steedless car, mounted the car, O<br>Bharata, of Niramitra. Then that slayer of hostile heroes, viz.,<br>Sahadeva, filled with rage slew in that great battle Niramitra in the<br>midst of his division with a broad-headed arrow. Thereupon, prince<br>Niramitra, the son of the ruler of the Trigartas, fell down from his car,<br>afflicting thy army with great grief. Slaying him, the mighty-armed<br>Sahadeva looked resplendent like Rama, the son of Dasaratha, after<br>slaying the mighty (Rakshasa) Khara. Beholding that mighty car-warrior,<br>viz., prince Niramitra slain, loud cries of Oh and Alas arose, O monarch,<br>among the Trigarta warriors. Nakula, O king, in a moment vanquished thy<br>son Vikarna of large eyes. This seemed highly wonderful. Vyaghradatta, by<br>means of his straight shafts, made Satyaki invisible with his steeds and<br>driver and standard in the midst of his division. The brave grandson of<br>Sini, baffling those shafts with great lightness of hand, felled<br>Vyaghradatta by means of his arrows, with his steeds and driver and<br>standard. Upon the fall, O lord, of that prince of the Magadhas, the<br>latter, struggling vigorously, rushed against Yuyudhana from all sides.<br>Scattering their shafts and lances by thousands, and sharp arrows and<br>spears and mallets and thick clubs, those brave warriors fought in that<br>battle with that invincible hero of the Satwata race. Endued with great<br>might, invincible Satyaki, that bull among men, with the greatest ease<br>and laughing the while, vanquished them all. The Magadhas were nearly<br>exterminated. A small remnant flew from the field. Beholding this, thy<br>army, already afflicted with the arrows of Yuyudhana, broke, O lord! Then<br>that foremost one of Madhu's race, having slaughtered ill battle thy<br>troops, that illustrious hero, looked resplendent as he shook his bow.<br>The army, O king, was thus routed by that high-souled one of the Satwata<br>race. Indeed, frightened by that hero of long arms, none approached him<br>for fight. Then Drona filled with rage and rolling his eyes, himself<br>rushed impetuously towards Satyaki, of feats incapable of being baffled.'"
