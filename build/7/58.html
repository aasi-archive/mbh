                            "Narada said, Usinara's son, Sivi also, O Srinjaya, we hear, fell a prey<br>to death. That king had, as it were, put a leathern girdle around the<br>earth, making the earth with her mountains and islands and seas and<br>forests resound with the clatter of his car. The vanquisher of foes,<br>viz., king Sivi. always slew the foremost of foes. He performed many<br>sacrifices with presents in profusion unto the Brahmanas. That monarch of<br>great prowess and great intelligence had acquired enormous wealth. In<br>battle: he won the applause of all Kshatriyas.[95] Having brought the<br>whole earth under subjection, he performed many Horse-sacrifices, without<br>any obstruction, which were productive of great merit giving away (as<br>sacrificial present) a thousand crores of golden nishkas, and many<br>elephants and steeds and other kinds of animals, much grain, and many<br>deer and sheep. And king Sivi gave away the sacred earth consisting of<br>diverse kinds of soil unto the Brahmanas. Indeed, Usinara's son, Sivi,<br>gave away as many kine as the number of rain-drops showered on the earth,<br>or the number of stars in the firmament, or the number of sand-grains or,<br>the bed of Ganga, or the number of rocks that constitute the mountain<br>called Meru, or the number of gems or of (aquatic) animals in the ocean.<br>The Creator himself hath not met with and will not meet within the past,<br>the present, or the future, another king capable of bearing the burdens<br>that king Sivi bore. Many were the sacrifices, with every kind of rites,<br>that king Sivi performed. In those sacrifices, the stakes, the carpets,<br>the houses, the walls, and the arches, were all made of gold. Food and<br>drink, agreeable to the taste and perfectly clean were kept in profusion.<br>And the Brahmanas that repaired to them could be counted by myriads and<br>myriads. Abounding with viands of every description, nothing but<br>agreeable words such as give away and take were heard there. Milk and<br>curds were collected in large lakes. In his sacrificial compound, there<br>were rivers of drink and white hills of food. 'Bathe, and drink and eat<br>as ye like,' these were the only words heard there. Gratified with his<br>righteous deeds, Rudra granted Sivi a boon, saying, As thou givest away,<br>let thy wealth, thy devotion,&#8212;thy fame, thy religious acts, the love<br>that all creatures bear thee, and the heaven (thou attain), be all<br>inexhaustible.' Having obtained all these desirable boons, even Sivi,<br>when the time came, left this world for heaven. When, O Srinjaya, he died<br>who was superior to thee, was much superior to thy son, thou shouldst<br>not, saying, 'Oh, Swaitya, Oh, Swaitya', grieve for thy son who performed<br>no sacrifice and made no sacrificial present.'"
