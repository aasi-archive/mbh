                            "Sanjaya said, 'After Partha had vowed the death of the ruler of the<br>Sindhus, the mighty-armed Vasudeva addressed Dhananjaya and said,&#8212;With<br>the consent of thy brothers (alone, but without consulting me), thou hast<br>sworn, saying&#8212;I will slay the ruler of the Sindhus! This hath been an<br>act of great rashness (on thy part)! Without consulting me, thou hast<br>taken up a great weight (upon thy shoulders)! Alas, how shall we escape<br>the ridicule of all men? I had sent some spies into the camp of<br>Dhritarashtra's son. Those spies, quickly coming unto me, gave me this<br>information, viz., that after thou, O lord, hadst vowed to slay the ruler<br>of the Sindhus, loud leonine shouts, mingled with the sounds of (our)<br>musical instruments, were heard by the Dhritarashtras. In consequence of<br>that uproar, the Dhritarashtras, with their well-wishers, became<br>terrified,&#8212;These leonine shouts are not, causeless!&#8212;thought they, and<br>waited (for what would ensue). O thou of mighty arms, an uproarious din<br>then arose amongst the Kauravas, of their elephants and steeds and<br>infantry. And a terrible rattle was also heard of their cars.&#8212;Having<br>heard of the death of Abhimanyu, Dhananjaya, deeply afflicted will in<br>wrath come out in the night for battle!&#8212;Than king even thus, they waited<br>(ready for battle). While preparing themselves. O thou of eyes like<br>lotus-petals, they then learnt truly the vow about the slaughter of the<br>ruler of the Sindhus, made by thee that art wedded to truth.[128] Then<br>all the counsellors of Suyodhana became heartless and frightened like<br>little animals. As regards king Jayadratha, that ruler of the Sindhus and<br>the Sauviras, overwhelmed with grief and becoming thoroughly cheerless he<br>stood up and entered his own tent with all his counsellors. Having<br>consulted (with them) about every remedy that could benefit him at a time<br>when he stood in need of consultation, he proceeded to the assembly of<br>the (allied) kings and there said these words unto Suyodhana&#8212;Dhananjaya<br>thinking me to be the slayer of his son, will tomorrow encounter me in<br>battle! He hath, in the midst of his army, vowed to stay me! That vow of<br>Savyasachin the very gods and Gandharvas and Asuras and Uragas and<br>Rakshasas cannot venture to frustrate! Protect me, therefore, ye all in<br>battle! Let not Dhananjaya, placing his foot on your head, succeed in<br>hitting the mark! Let proper arrangements be made in respect of this<br>matter! Or, if, O delighter of the Kurus, you think that you will not<br>succeed in protecting me in battle, grant me permission then, O king, so<br>that I may return home! Thus addressed (by Jayadratha), Suyodhana became<br>cheerless and sat, hanging down his head. Ascertaining that Jayadratha<br>was in a great fright, Suyodhana began to reflect in silence. Beholding<br>the Kuru king to be greatly afflicted, king Jayadratha, the ruler of the<br>Sindhus, slowly said these words having a beneficial reference to<br>himself&#8212;I do not behold here that bowman of superior energy who can<br>baffle with his arms the weapons of Arjuna in great battle! Who, even if<br>it be Satakratu himself, will stay in front of Arjuna having Vasudeva for<br>his ally, while wielding the bow Gandiva? It is heard that lord Maheswara<br>himself of supreme energy had been encountered, before this, by Partha on<br>foot, on the mountains of Himvat! Urged by the chief of the celestials,<br>he slew on a single car, a thousand Danavas dwelling in Hiranyapura! That<br>son of Kunti is now allied with Vasudeva of great intelligence. I think<br>that he is competent to destroy the three worlds including the very gods.<br>I wish that you will either grant me permission (to leave the field for<br>my home) or that the high-souled and heroic Drona with his son will<br>protect me! Or, I would await thy pleasure!&#8212;O Arjuna, (thus addressed by<br>Jayadratha) king Suyodhana humbly beseeched the preceptor in this<br>matter.[129] All remedial measures have been adopted. Cars and steeds<br>have been arranged. Karna and Bhurisravas, and Drona's son, and the<br>invincible Vrishasena, and Kripa, and the ruler of the Madras, these six<br>will be in (Jayadratha's) van. Drona will form an array half of which<br>will be a Sakata[130] and half a lotus. In the middle of the leaves of<br>that lotus will be a needle-mouthed array. Jayadratha, that ruler of the<br>Sindhus, difficult of being conquered in battle, will take his stand, by<br>it, protected by heroes! In (the use of) the bow, in weapons, in prowess,<br>in strength, and also in lineage, those six car-warriors, O Partha are<br>without doubt, exceedingly difficult of being borne. Without first<br>vanquishing those six car-warriors, access to Jayadratha will not to be<br>had. Think, O Arjuna, of the prowess of each of those six, O tiger among<br>men, when united together, they are not capable of being easily<br>vanquished! We should, therefore, once again, take counsel with<br>well-wishing counsellors, conversant with policy, for our benefit and for<br>the success of our object!'"
