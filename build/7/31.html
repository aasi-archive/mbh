                            (Abhimanyu-badha Parva)<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Having been first broken by Arjuna of immeasurable<br>prowess, and owing also to the failure of Drona's vow, in consequence of<br>Yudhishthira having been well-protected, thy warriors were regarded as<br>defeated. All of them with coats of mail torn and covered with dust, cast<br>anxious glances around. Retiring from the field with Drona's consent,<br>after having been vanquished by their enemies of sure aim and humiliated<br>by them in battle, they heard, as they proceeded, the countless merits of<br>Phalguni praised by all creatures, and the friendship of Kesava for<br>Arjuna spoken of by all. They passed the night like men under a curse,<br>reflecting upon the course of events and observing perfect silence.<br><br>"Next morning, Duryodhana said unto Drona, these words, from petulance<br>and wrath, and in great cheerlessness of heart at the sight of the<br>prosperity of their foe. Skilled in speech, and filled with rage at the<br>success of the foe, the king said these words in the hearing of all the<br>troops, 'O foremost of regenerate ones, without doubt thou hast set us<br>down for men who should be destroyed by thee. Thou didst not seize<br>Yudhishthira today even though thou hadst got him within thy reach. That<br>foe whom thou wouldst seize in battle is incapable of escaping thee if<br>once thou gettest him within sight, even if he be protected by the<br>Pandavas, aided by the very gods. Gratified, thou gavest me a boon; now,<br>however, thou dost not act according to it. They that are noble (like<br>thee), never falsify the hopes of one devoted to them.' Thus addressed by<br>Duryodhana, Bharadwaja's son felt greatly ashamed. Addressing the king,<br>he said, 'It behoveth thee not to take me to be such. I always endeavour<br>to achieve what is agreeable to thee. The three worlds with the gods, the<br>Asuras, the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, the Nagas and the Rakshasas, cannot<br>defeat the force that is protected by the diadem-decked (Arjuna). There<br>where Govinda, the Creator of the universe is, and there where Arjuna is<br>the commander, whose might can avail, save three-eyed Mahadeva's, O lord?<br>O sire, I tell the truly today and it will not be otherwise. Today, I<br>will slay a mighty car-warrior, one of the foremost heroes of the<br>Pandavas. Today I will also form an array that impenetrable by the very<br>gods. Do, however, O king, by some means take Arjuna away from the field.<br>There is nothing that he doth not know or cannot achieve in battle. From<br>various places hath he acquired all that is to be known about battle.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'After Drona had said these words, the Samsaptakas<br>once more challenged Arjuna to battle and took him away to the southern<br>side of the field. Then an encounter took place between Arjuna and his<br>enemies, the like of which had never been seen or heard of. On the other<br>hand, the array formed by Drona, O king, looked resplendent. Indeed, that<br>array was incapable of being looked at like the sun himself when in his<br>course he reaches the meridian and scorches (everything underneath).<br>Abhimanyu, at the command, O Bharata, of his sire's eldest brother,<br>pierced in battle that impenetrable circular array in many places. Having<br>achieved the most difficult feats and slain heroes by thousands, he was<br>(at last) encountered by six heroes together. In the end, succumbing to<br>Duhsasana's son, O lord of earth, Subhadra's son, O chastiser of foes,<br>gave up his life. At this we were filled with great joy and the Pandavas<br>with great grief. And after Subhadra's son had been slain, our troops<br>were withdrawn for nightly rest.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Hearing, O Sanjaya, of the slaughter of the son<br>(Abhimanyu), yet in his minority, of that lion among men, (viz., Arjuna),<br>my heart seems to break into pieces. Cruel, indeed, are the duties of<br>Kshatriyas as laid down by the legislators, in as much as brave men,<br>desirous of sovereignty scrupled not to shoot their weapons at even a<br>child. O son of Gavalgana, tell me how so many warriors, accomplished in<br>arms, slew that child who, though brought up in luxury, yet careered over<br>the field so fearlessly. Tell me, O Sanjaya, how our warriors behaved in<br>battle with Subhadra's son immeasurable energy who had penetrated into<br>our car-array.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'That which thou askest me, O king, viz., the slaughter of<br>Subhadra's son, I will describe to thee in detail. Listen, O monarch,<br>with attention. I shall relate to thee how that youth, having penetrated<br>into our ranks, played with his weapons, and how the irresistible heroes<br>of thy army, all inspired by hope of victory, were afflicted by him. Like<br>the denizens of a forest abounding with plants and herbs and trees, when<br>surrounded on all sides by a forest conflagration, the warriors of thy<br>army were all filled with fear.'"
