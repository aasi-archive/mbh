                            "Dhritarashtra, said, 'Describe to me, O Sanjaya, the diverse kinds of<br>standards resplendent with great beauty, of both the Partha and our<br>warriors (in that battle).'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Hear, O king, of the diverse kinds of standards of those<br>high-souled warriors. Listen to me as I describe their forms and names.<br>Indeed, O king, upon the cars of those foremost of car-warriors were seen<br>diverse kinds of standards that shone like blazing flames of fire. Made<br>of gold, or decked with gold, or adorned with strings of gold and each<br>looking like the golden mountain (Meru), diverse kinds of standards were<br>there that were highly beautiful. And those standards of the warriors had<br>attached all around them excellent banners. Indeed, having banners of<br>diverse hues attached to them all around, those standards looked<br>exceedingly beautiful. Those banners, again, moved by the wind, looked<br>like fair ladies dancing in the midst of a sporting arena. Endued with<br>the splendour of the rainbow, those banners, O bull of Bharata's race, of<br>those car-warriors, floating in the breeze, highly adorned their cars.<br>The standard, bearing the sign of the ape of fierce face and tail, like<br>that of the lion, belonging to Dhananjaya, seemed to inspire fear in that<br>battle. That standard, O king of the wielder of Gandiva, bearing that<br>foremost of apes, and adorned with many banners, frightened the Kuru<br>host. Similarly, the lion-tail standard-top of Drona's son, O Bharata, we<br>saw, was endued with the effulgence of the rising sun Decked with gold,<br>floating in the breeze, possessed of the splendour of the rainbow, the<br>standard mark of Drona's son appeared on high, inspiring the foremost of<br>Kuru warriors with joy. The standard of Adhiratha's son bore the mark of<br>an elephant-rope made of gold. It seemed, O king, in battle to fill the<br>whole welkin. The banner, adorned with gold and garlands, attached to the<br>standard of Karna in battle, shaken by the wind, seemed to dance upon his<br>car. The preceptor of the Pandavas, that Brahmana, given to ascetic<br>penances, viz., Kripa the son of Gotama, had for his mark an excellent<br>bovine bull. That high-souled one, O king, with that bovine bull, looked<br>as resplendent, as the Destroyer of the three cities[147] looks<br>resplendent with his bull. Vrishasena has a peacock made of gold and<br>adorned with jewels and gems. And it stood on his standard, as if in the<br>act of crowing, and always adorned the wan of the army. With that<br>peacock, the car of the high-souled Vrishasena shone, like the car, O<br>king, of Skanda (the celestial generalissimo) shining 'with his peacock<br>unrivalled and beautiful ploughshare made of gold and looking like flame<br>of fire. That ploughshare, O sire, looked resplendent on his car. Salya,<br>the ruler of the Madras, we saw, had on his standard-top an image like<br>the presiding goddess of corn, endued with beauty and producing every<br>seed. A silver boar adorned the standard-top of the ruler of the Sindhus.<br>Decked with golden chains, it was of the splendour of a white<br>crystal.[148] With that silver mark on his barrier, the ruler of the<br>Sindhus looked as resplendent, as Surya in days of yore in the battle<br>between the celestials and the Asuras. The standard of Somadatta's son,<br>devoted to sacrifices, bore the sign of the sacrificial stake. It was<br>seen to shine like the sun or the moon. That sacrificial stake made of<br>gold, O king of Somadatta's son, looked resplendent like the tall stake<br>erected in the foremost of sacrifices called the Rajasuya. The standard<br>of Salya, O monarch, bearing a huge silver-elephant was adorned, on all<br>sides, with peacocks made of gold. The standard, O bull of Bharata's<br>race, adorned thy troops like the huge white elephant adorning the host<br>of the celestial king. On the standard decked with gold, of king<br>Duryodhana, was an elephant adorned with gems. Tinkling with the sound of<br>a hundred bells, O king, that standard stood upon the excellent car of<br>that hero. And, O king, thy son, that bull among the Kurus, looked<br>resplendent, O monarch, with that tall standard in battle. These nine<br>excellent standards stood erect among thy divisions. The tenth standard<br>seen there was of Arjuna, decked with that huge ape. And with that<br>standard Arjuna looked highly resplendent, like Himavat with a blazing<br>fire (on its top). Then many mighty car-warriors, all chastisers of foes,<br>quickly took up their beautiful, bright and large bows for the sake of<br>(resisting) Arjuna. Similarly, Partha also, that achiever of celestial<br>feats, took up his foe-destroying bow Gandiva, in consequence, O king, of<br>thy evil policy. Many royal warriors, O king, were then slain in that<br>battle owing to thy fault. Rulers of men came from different realms<br>invited (by thy sons). And with them perished many steeds and many<br>elephants. Then those mighty car-warriors headed by Duryodhana (on one<br>side) and that bull amongst the Pandavas on the other, uttered loud roars<br>and began the encounter. And the feat that Kunti's son, having Krishna<br>for his charioteer, achieved there, was highly wonderful, inasmuch as,<br>alone, he encountered fearlessly all those warriors united together. And<br>that mighty-armed hero looked resplendent as he stretched his bow<br>Gandiva, desirous of vanquishing all those tigers among men for slaying<br>the ruler of the Sindhus. With his shafts shot in thousands, that tiger<br>among men, viz., Arjuna, that scorcher of foes, made all those warriors<br>invisible (by means of his arrowy showers). On their side, those tigers<br>among men, those mighty car-warriors, also made Partha invisible by means<br>of their clouds of shafts shot from all sides. Beholding Arjuna, that<br>bull of Kuru's race covered by those lions among men with their shafts,<br>loud was the uproar made by thy troops.'
