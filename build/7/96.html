                            "Sanjaya said, 'When that fierce battle, causing the hair to stand on<br>end, commenced, the Pandavas rushed against the Kauravas who had been<br>divided into three bodies. Bhimasena rushed against the mighty-armed<br>Jalasandha, and Yudhishthira, at the head of his troops rushed, in that<br>battle, against Kritavarman. And Dhrishtadyumna, O king, scattering the<br>shafts, like the sun shooting his rays, rushed against Drona. Then<br>commenced that battle between all the bowmen, eager for the encounter, of<br>the Kurus and the Pandavas, excited with wrath. And during the progress<br>of that terrible carnage, when all the warriors were battling with one<br>another fearlessly the mighty Drona fought with the mighty prince of the<br>Panchalas. And the clouds of arrows he shot in that encounter filled all<br>spectators with wonder. And Drona and the prince of the Panchalas,<br>cutting off the heads of men by thousands, scattered them on the field of<br>battle, making the latter resemble a forest of lotuses. In every<br>division, were soon strewn on the ground robes and ornaments and weapons,<br>and standards and coats of mail. And golden coats of mail, dyed with<br>blood, looked like clouds charged with lightning. Other mighty<br>car-warriors, drawing their large bows measuring full six cubits long,<br>felled with their shafts, elephants and steeds and men. In that dreadful<br>encounter of arms between brave and high-souled warriors, swords and<br>shields, bows and heads and coats of mail were seen lying scattered<br>about. Innumerable headless trunks wore seen to rise up, O king, in the<br>midst of that fierce battle. And vultures and Kankas and jackals and<br>swarms of other carnivorous animals, O sire, were seen there, eating the<br>flesh of fallen men and steeds and elephants, of drinking their blood, or<br>dragging them by the hair, or licking or pecking, O king, at their<br>marrow, or dragging their bodies and severed limbs, or rolling their<br>heads on the ground. Warriors, skilled in battle, accomplished in<br>weapons, and firmly resolved in fight, struggled vigorously in the<br>combat, solicitous only of fame. Many were the combatants that careered<br>over the field, performing the diverse evolutions, of swordsmen. With<br>sabres and darts and lances and spears and axes, with maces and spiked<br>clubs and other kinds of weapons, and with even bare arms, men who had<br>entered the arena of battle, filled with rage, slew one another. And<br>car-warriors fought with car-warriors, and horsemen with horsemen, and<br>elephants with foremost of elephants, and foot-soldiers with<br>foot-soldiers. And many infuriated elephants, as if perfectly mad,<br>uttered loud shrieks and slew one another, after the manner they do in<br>sporting arenas.<br><br>"During the progress, O king, of that battle in which the combatants<br>fought without any regard for one another, Dhrishtadyumna caused his own<br>steeds to be mixed up with those of Drona. Those steeds endued with the<br>speed of the wind, that were white as pigeons and red as blood, thus<br>mixed with one another in battle, looked exceedingly beautiful. Indeed,<br>they looked resplendent like clouds charged with lightning. Then that<br>slayer of hostile heroes, viz., heroic Dhrishtadyumna, the son of<br>Prishata, beholding Drona, O Bharata, arrived so near, cast off his bow<br>and took up his sword and shield, for achieving a difficult feat. Seizing<br>the shaft of Drona's car, he entered into it. And he stayed sometimes on<br>the middle of the yoke, and sometimes on its joints and sometimes behind<br>the steeds. And while he was moving, armed with swords, quickly upon the<br>backs of those red steeds of Drona, the latter could not detect an<br>opportunity for striking him.[139] All this seemed wonderful to us.<br>Indeed, like the sweep of a hawk in the woods from desire of food, seemed<br>that sally of Dhrishtadyumna from his own car for the destruction of<br>Drona. Then Drona cut off, with a hundred arrows, the shield, decked with<br>a hundred moons, of Drupada's son, and then his sword, with ten others.<br>And mighty Drona then, with four and sixty arrows, slew the steeds of his<br>antagonist. And with a couple of broad-headed shafts he cut off the<br>latter's standard and umbrella also, and then slew both his Parshni<br>charioteers. And then with great speed drawing his bow-string to his ear,<br>he shot at him a fatal shaft, like the wielder of the thunder hurling the<br>thunder (at a foe). But soon Satyaki, with four and ten sharp shafts, cut<br>off that fatal arrow of Drona. And thus the Vrishni hero, O sire, rescued<br>Dhrishtadyumna, who had been seized by that lion among men, the foremost<br>of preceptors, like a deer seized by the king of the forests. Even thus<br>did that bull amongst the Sinis, the prince of the Panchalas. Beholding<br>Satyaki to rescue the prince of the Panchalas in the dreadful battle,<br>Drona quickly shot at him six and twenty arrows. The grandson of Sini<br>then, in return, pierced Drona in the centre of the chest with six and<br>twenty arrows, while the latter was engaged in devouring the Srinjayas.<br>Then all the Panchala car-warriors, desirous of victory upon the Satwata<br>hero, proceeding against Drona, quickly withdrew Dhrishtadyumna from the<br>battle.'"
