                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Thou hast, O Sanjaya, described to me many<br>excellent single combats. Hearing about them, I envy those that have<br>eyes. This battle between the Kurus and the Pandavas, resembling that (of<br>old) between the gods and the Asuras, will be spoken of as exceedingly<br>wonderful by all men. I am scarcely gratified by listening to thy<br>narrations of this stirring battle. Tell me, therefore, about this combat<br>between Artayani (Salya) and Subhadra's son.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding his driver slain, Salya, upraising a mace made<br>wholly of iron, jumped down in rage from his excellent car. Bhima, then<br>taking up his own huge mace, quickly rushed towards Salya who then<br>resembled the blazing Yuga-fire or the Destroyer himself armed with his<br>bludgeon. Subhadra's son also, taking up a prodigious mace resembling the<br>bolt of heaven, addressed Salya, saying, 'Come, Come!' Bhima, however,<br>with much ado, persuaded him to stand aside. The valiant Bhimasena, then,<br>having persuaded Subhadra's son to stand aside, approached Salya in<br>battle and stood immovable as a hill. The mighty ruler of Madras also,<br>beheld Bhima, and proceeded towards him like a tiger towards an elephant.<br>Then was heard there the loud blare of trumpets and conchs by thousands<br>and leonine shouts, and the sound of drums. And loud cries of 'Bravo,<br>Bravo,' arose among hundreds of Pandava and Kaurava warriors rushing<br>towards each other. There is none else among all the kings, O Bharata,<br>save the ruler of Madras who can venture to bear the might of Bhimasena<br>in battle; similarly, who else save Vrikodara, in the world, can venture<br>to bear the impetus of the illustrious Salya's mace in battle? Bound in<br>hempen strings mixed with wires of gold, the prodigious mace, of Bhima,<br>capable of delighting by its beauty all spectators, being grasped by him,<br>shone, brilliantly. And similarly the mace of Salya, also, who coursed in<br>beautiful circles, looked like a blazing flash of lightning. Both of them<br>roared like bulls, and both coursed in circles. And both Salya and<br>Vrikodara, standing as they did, with their maces slightly bent, looked<br>like a couple of horned bulls. Whether as regards coursing in circles or<br>in whirling and striking with their maces, the combat that took place<br>between those two lions among men was in every way equal. Struck by<br>Bhimasena with his mace, the prodigious mace of Salya, emitting fierce<br>sparks of fire, soon broke unto fragments. And similarly, Bhimasena's<br>mace, struck by the foe, looked beautiful like a tree covered fire-flies<br>during the season of rains at even-tide. And the mace that the ruler of<br>Madras hurled in that battle, irradiating the welkin, O Bharata,<br>frequently caused sparks of fire (to fly around). Similarly, the mace<br>hurled by Bhimasena at the foe scorched his antagonist's forces like a<br>fierce meteor falling down (from the firmament). And both those best of<br>maces, striking against each other, resembled sighing she-snakes and<br>caused flashes of fire. Like two large tigers attacking each other with<br>their claws, or like two mighty elephants with their tusks, those mighty<br>warriors coursed in circles, encountering each other with those two<br>foremost of maces, and soon covered with blood, those two illustrious<br>warriors seemed to resemble a couple of flowering Kinsukas. And the<br>blows, loud as Indra's thunder, of the maces wielded by those two lions<br>among men were heard on all sides. Struck by the ruler of Madras with his<br>mace on both the left and the right side, Bhima moved not in the least,<br>like a hill riven by the thunder. Similarly, the mighty ruler of Madras,<br>struck by Bhima with his mace, patiently stood still like a hill struck<br>with the thunder. Both of them, with upraised maces, endued as they were<br>with great impetus, fell upon each other, coursing in shorter circles.<br>Quickly nearing each other, then by eight steps and falling upon each<br>other like two elephants, they suddenly struck each other with those<br>maces of theirs made entirely or iron. And each of those heroes, in<br>consequence of the other's impetuosity and violence being struck with<br>each other's mace, fell down at the same instant of time like a couple of<br>Indra's poles. Then the mighty car-warrior Kritavarman quickly approached<br>Salya who, deprived of his senses, was breathing hard as he lay on the<br>field. And beholding him, O king, struck violently with the mace, and<br>writhing like a snake, and deprived of his senses in a swoon, the mighty<br>car-warrior Kritavarman, taking him upon his car, quickly bore the ruler<br>of Madras away from the field. Reeling like a drunken man, the heroic<br>Bhima of mighty arms, rising up within the twinkling of an eye, stood<br>mace in hand. Thy sons then, beholding the ruler of the Madras turn away<br>from the fight, began, O sire, to tremble, along with their elephants,<br>and foot-soldiers, and cavalry, and cars. Ground then by the Pandavas<br>desirous of victory, those warriors of thy army, struck with fear, fled<br>away in all directions, like masses of clouds driven away by the wind.<br>And those mighty car-warriors, viz., the Pandavas, having vanquished the<br>Dhritarashtras, looked resplendent in that battle. O king, like blazing<br>fires. And they uttered loud leonine roars, and blew their conchs, elated<br>with joy. And they beat their drums, large and small, and cymbals and<br>other instruments.'"
