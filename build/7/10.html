                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Having addressed the Suta's son in this way,<br>Dhritarashtra, afflicted with excessive grief of heart and hopeless of<br>his son's victory, fell down on the ground. Beholding him deprived of his<br>senses and fallen down, his attendants sprinkled him with perfumed and<br>cold water, fanning him the while. Seeing him fallen, the Bharata ladies<br>O king, surrounded him on all sides and gently rubbed him with their<br>hands. And slowly raising the king from the ground, those royal ladies,<br>their voices chocked with tears, seated him on his seat. Seated, the King<br>continued to be under the influence of that swoon. And he remained<br>perfectly motionless, while they fanned him standing around. And a<br>tremour then passed over the monarch's body and he slowly regained his<br>senses. And once more he began to interrogate Gavalgana's son of the Suta<br>caste about the incidents, as they occured in the battle.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, [That Ajatasatru] who, like the risen sun,<br>dispelleth darkness by his own light; who rusheth against a foe as a<br>swift and angry elephant with rent temples, incapable of being vanquished<br>by hostile leaders of herds, rusheth against a rival proceeding with<br>cheerful face towards a female of the species in rust, O, what warriors<br>(of my army) resisted that Ajatasatru as he came, for keeping him away<br>from Drona?[15] That hero, that foremost of persons, who hath slain many<br>brave warriors (of my army) in battle, that mighty-armed and intelligent<br>and courageous prince of unbaffled prowess, who, unassisted by any one,<br>can consume the entire host of Duryodhana by means of his terrible<br>glances alone, that slayer by his sight, that one bent on winning<br>victory, that bowman, that hero of unfading glory, that self-restrained<br>monarch who is revered by the whole world, O, who were those heroes (of<br>my army) that surrounded that warrior?[16] That invincible prince, that<br>bowman of unfading glory, that tiger among men, that son of Kunti, who<br>advancing with great celerity came upon Drona, that mighty warrior who<br>always achieves grand feats against the foe, that hero of gigantic fame<br>and great courage, who in strength is equal to ten thousand elephants, O,<br>what brave combatants of my army surrounded that Bhimasena as he rushed<br>upon my host? When that car-warrior of exceeding energy, viz., Vibhatsu,<br>looking like a mass of clouds, came, emitting thunderbolts like the<br>clouds themselves, shooting showers of arrows like Indra pouring rain,<br>and making all the points of the compass resound with the slaps of his<br>palms and the rattle of his car-wheels, when that hero whose bow was like<br>the lightning's flash and whose car resembled a cloud having for its<br>roars the rattle of its wheels (when that hero came) the whizz of whose<br>arrows made him exceedingly fierce, whose wrath resembles an awful cloud,<br>and who is fleet as the mind or the tempest, who always pierces the foe<br>deep into his very vitals, who, armed with shafts, is terrible to look<br>at, who like Death himself bathes all the points of the compass with<br>human blood in profusion, and who, with fierce uproar and awful visage,<br>wielding the bow Gandiva incessantly pours on my warriors headed by<br>Duryodhana shafts whetted on stone and furnished with vultures' feathers,<br>alas, when that hero of great intelligence came upon you, what became the<br>state of your mind? When that warrior having the huge ape on his banner<br>came, obstructing the welkin with dense showers of arrows, what became<br>that state of your mind at sight of that Partha? Did Arjuna advance upon<br>you, slaying your troops with the twang of the Gandiva and achieving<br>fierce feats on the way? Did Duryodhana take, with his shafts, your<br>lives, like the tempest destroying gathering masses of clouds or felling<br>forests of reeds, blowing through them? What man is there that is capable<br>of bearing in battle the wielder of the Gandiva? Hearing only that he is<br>stationed at the head of the (hostile) force, the heart of every foe<br>seems to rend in twain. In that battle in which the troops trembled and<br>even heroes were struck with fear, who were they that did not desert<br>Drona, and who were those cowards that abandoned him from fear? Who were<br>they that, reckless of their lives met Death himself, standing face to<br>face with them, in the shape of Dhananjaya, who hath vanquished even<br>superhuman combatants in battle? My troops are incapable of bearing the<br>impetus of that warrior having white steeds yoked unto his car and the<br>twang of Gandiva, that resembles the roll of the very clouds. That car<br>which has Vishnu himself for its driver and Dhananjaya for its warrior,<br>that car I regard to be incapable of being vanquished by the very gods<br>and the Asuras united together. Delicate, young, and brave, and of a very<br>handsome countenance, that son of Pandu who is gifted with intelligence<br>and skill and wisdom and whose prowess incapable of being baffled in<br>battle, when Nakula with loud noise and afflicting all hostile warriors,<br>rushed at Drona, what heroes (of my army) surrounded him? When Sahadeva<br>who resembles an angry snake of virulent poison, when that hero owning<br>white steeds and invincible in battle, observant of laudable vows,<br>incapable of being baffled in his purposes, gifted with modesty, and<br>never vanquished in fight, came upon us, what heroes (of our army)<br>surrounded him? That warrior who, having crushed the mighty host of the<br>Sauvira king, took for his wife the beautiful Bhoja maiden of symmetrical<br>limbs, that bull among men, viz., Yuyudhana, in whom are always truth and<br>firmness and bravery and Brahmacharya, that warrior gifted with great<br>might, always practising truth, never cheerless, never vanquished, who in<br>battle is equal to Vasudeva and is regarded as his second self, who,<br>through Dhananjaya's instructions, hath become foremost in the use of<br>arrows, and who is equal to Partha himself in weapons, O, what warrior<br>(of my army) resisted that Satyaki, for keeping him away from Drona? The<br>foremost hero among the Vrishnis, exceedingly brave among all bowmen,<br>equal to Rama himself in (knowledge and the use of) weapons and in<br>prowess and fame, (know, O Sanjaya, that) truth and firmness,<br>intelligence and heroism, and knowledge of Brahma, and high weapons, are<br>all in him (Satyaki) of the Satwata race, as the three worlds are in<br>Kesava. What heroes (of my army), approaching that mighty bowman,<br>Satyaki, possessed of all those accomplishments and incapable of being<br>resisted by the very gods, surrounded him? The foremost among the<br>Panchalas, possessed of heroism, high-born and the favourite of all<br>high-born heroes, ever achieving good deeds in battle, viz., Uttamaujas,<br>that Prince ever engaged in the welfare of Arjuna, born for only my evil,<br>equal unto Yama, or Vaisaravana, or Aditya, or Mahendra, or Varuna, that<br>prince regarded as a mighty car-warrior and prepared to lay down his life<br>in the thick of battle, O, what heroes (of my army) surrounded him? Who<br>(amongst my warriors) opposed Dhrishtaketu, that single warrior amongst<br>the Chedis who, deserting them, hath embraced the side of the Pandavas,<br>while he rushed upon Drona? Who resisted the heroic Ketumat for keeping<br>him away from Drona, the brave Ketumat who slew prince Durjaya while the<br>latter had taken shelter in Girivraja? What heroes (of my army)<br>surrounded Sikhandin, that tiger among men, who knows the merits and<br>demerits (in his own person) of manhood and femininity, that son of<br>Yajnasena, who is always cheerful in battle, that hero who became the<br>cause of the high-souled Bhishma's death in battle, when he rushed<br>towards Drona? That foremost hero of the Vrishni race, that chief of all<br>bowmen, that brave warrior in whom all accomplishments exist in a greater<br>degree than in Dhananajaya himself, in whom are ever weapons and truth<br>and Brahmacharya, who is equal to Vasudeva in energy and Dhananjaya in<br>strength, who in splendour is equal to Aditya and in intelligence to<br>Vrihaspati, viz., the high-souled Abhimanyu, resembling Death himself<br>with wide-open mouth, O what heroes (of my army) surrounded him when he<br>rushed towards Drona? That youth of vigorous understanding, that slayer<br>of hostile heroes, viz., Subhadra's son, O, when he rushed towards Drona,<br>what became the state of your mind? What heroes surrounded those tigers<br>among men, viz., the sons of Draupadi, when they rushed in battle against<br>Drona like rivers rushing towards the sea? Those children who, giving up<br>all (childish) sports for twelve years, and observing excellent vows,<br>waited upon Bhishma for the sake of weapons, those children, viz.,<br>Kshatranjaya and Kshatradeva and Kshatravarman and Manada, those heroic<br>sons of Dhrishtadyumna, O, who resisted them, seeking to keep them away<br>from Drona? He whom the Vrishnis regarded as superior in battle to a<br>hundred car-warriors, O, who resisted that great bowman, viz., Chekitana,<br>for keeping him away from Drona? Those five Kekaya brothers, virtuous and<br>possessed of prowess, incapable of being baffled, resembling (in hue) the<br>insects called Indragopakas, with red coats of mail, red weapons and red<br>banners, those heroes that are the maternal cousins of the Pandavas and<br>that always wish for victory unto the latter, O, what heroes (of my army)<br>surrounded those valiant princes when they rushed towards Drona for<br>slaying him? That lord of battle, that foremost of bowmen, that hero of<br>unbaffled aim and great strength, that tiger among men, viz., Yuyutsu,<br>whom many wrathful kings battling together for six months at Varanavata<br>from desire of slaying him could not vanquish, and who in battle at<br>Varanasi overthrew with a broad-headed arrow that mighty car-warrior,<br>viz., the prince of Kasi, desirous of seizing (at a Swayamvara) a maiden<br>for wife, O, what hero (of my army) resisted him? That mighty bowman,<br>viz., Dhrishtadyumna, who is the chief counsellor of the Pandavas, who is<br>engaged in doing evil to Duryodhana, who was created for Drona's<br>destruction, O, what heroes (of my army) surrounded him when he came<br>towards Drona, breaking through all my ranks and consuming all my<br>warriors in battle? That foremost of all persons conversant with weapons,<br>who has been reared almost on Drupada's lap, O, what warriors (of my<br>army) surrounded that Sikhandin protected by (Arjuna's) weapons, for<br>keeping him away from Drona? He who encompassed this earth by the loud<br>rattle of his car as by a leathern belt, that mighty car-warrior and<br>foremost of all slayers of foes, who, as (a substitute for) all<br>sacrifices, performed, without hindrance, ten Horse sacrifices with<br>excellent food and drink and gifts in profusion, who ruled his subjects<br>as if they were his children, that Usinara's son who in sacrifices gave<br>away kine countless as the grains of sand in the Ganga's stream, whose<br>feat none amongst men have been or will ever be able to imitate, after<br>the performance of whose difficult feats the very gods had cried out,<br>saying, 'We do not see in the three worlds with their mobile and immobile<br>creatures a second person other than Usinara's son who, was, has ever<br>been, or will ever be born, who hath attained to regions (in after-life)<br>which are unattainable by human beings, O, who (amongst my army) resisted<br>that Saivya, that grandson of that Usinara's son, while he came upon<br>(Drona)? What heroes (of my army) surrounded the car-division of that<br>slayer of foes, viz.. Virata, the king of the Matsyas, while it reached<br>Drona in battle? Who kept away from Drona the gigantic Ghatotkacha, that<br>thorn (on the side), of my sons, that warrior who always wishes victory<br>unto the Pandavas, that heroic Rakshasa, possessed of extensive powers of<br>illusion, endued with great strength and great prowess, and born of Bhima<br>in course of a single day, and of whom I entertain very great fears?[17]<br>What, O Srinjaya, can remain unconquered by them for whose sake these and<br>many others are prepared to Jay down their lives in battle? How can the<br>sons of Pritha meet with defeat, they, viz., that have the greatest of<br>all beings, the wielder of the bow called Sarnga, for their refuge and<br>benefactor? Vasudeva is, indeed, the great Master of all the worlds, the<br>Lord of all, and Eternal! Of celestial soul and infinite power, Narayana<br>is the refuge of men in battle. The wise recite his celestial feats. I<br>also will recite them with devotion, for recovering my firmness!'"
