                            "Sanjaya said, 'Thou askest me, O monarch, about the prowess of the ruler<br>of the Sindhus. Listen to me as I describe in detail how he fought with<br>the Pandavas. Large steeds of the Sindhu breed, well-trained and fleet as<br>the wind, and obedient to the commands of the charioteer, bore him (on<br>that occasion). His car, duly equipped, looked like a vapoury edifice in<br>the welkin. His standard bearing the device of a large boar in silver,<br>looked exceedingly beautiful. With his white umbrella and banners, and<br>the yak-tails with which he was fanned&#8212;which are regal indications&#8212;he<br>shone like the Moon himself in the firmament. His car-fence made of iron<br>was decked with pearls and diamonds and gems and gold. And it looked<br>resplendent like the firmament bespangled with luminous bodies. Drawing<br>his large bow and scattering countless shafts, he once more filled up<br>that array in those places where openings had been made by the son of<br>Arjuna. And he pierced Satyaki with three arrows, and Vrikodara with<br>eight; and having pierced Dhrishtadyumna. with sixty arrows, he pierced<br>Drupada with five sharp ones, and Sikhandin with ten. Piercing then the<br>Kaikeyas with five and twenty arrows, Jayadratha pierced each of the five<br>sons of Draupadi with three arrows. And piercing Yudhishthira then with<br>seventy arrows, the ruler of the Sindhus pierced the other heroes of the<br>Pandava army with thick showers of shafts. And that feat of his seemed<br>exceedingly wonderful. Then, O monarch, the valiant son of Dharma, aiming<br>Jayadratha's bow, cut it off with a polished and well-tempered shaft,<br>smiling the while. Within the twinkling, however, of the eye, the ruler<br>of the Sindhus took up another bow and piercing Pratha (Yudhishthira)<br>with ten arrows struck each of the others with three shafts. Marking that<br>lightness of hands showed by Jayadratha, Bhima then with three<br>broad-headed shafts, quickly felled on the earth his bow, standard and<br>umbrella. The mighty Jayadratha then, taking up another bow, strung it<br>and felled Bhima's standard and bow and steeds. O sire! His bow cut off,<br>Bhimasena then jumping down from that excellent car whose steeds had been<br>slain, mounted on the car of Satyaki, like a lion jumping to the top of a<br>mountain. Seeing this, thy troops were filled with joy. And they loudly<br>shouted, 'Excellent! Excellent!' And they repeatedly applauded that feat<br>of the ruler of the Sindhus. Indeed, all creatures highly applauded that<br>feat of his, which consisted in his resisting, single-handed, all the<br>Pandavas together, excited with wrath. The path that the son of Subhadra<br>had made for the Pandavas by the slaughter of numerous warriors and<br>elephants was then filled up by the ruler of the Sindhus. Indeed, those<br>heroes, viz., the Matsyas, the Panchalas, the Kaikeyas, and the Pandavas,<br>exerting themselves vigorously, succeeded in approaching the presence of<br>Jayadratha, but none of them could bear him. Everyone amongst thy enemies<br>who endeavoured to pierce the array that had been formed by Drona, was<br>checked by the ruler of the Sindhus in consequence of the boon he had got<br>(from Mahadeva).'"
