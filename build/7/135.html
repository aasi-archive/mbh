                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding thy sons lying (on the field), Karna of great<br>prowess filled with great wrath, became hopeless about his life. And<br>Adhiratha's son regarded himself guilty, seeing thy sons slain before his<br>eyes in battle by Bhima. Then Bhimasena, recollecting the wrongs formerly<br>inflicted by Karna, became filled with rage and began with deliberate<br>care to pierce Karna with many keen arrows. Then Karna, piercing Bhima<br>with five arrows, smiling the while, once more pierced him with seventy<br>arrows, equipped with golden wings and whetted on stone. Disregarding<br>these shafts shot by Karna, Vrikodara pierced the son of Radha in that<br>battle with a hundred straight shafts. And once more, piercing him in his<br>vitals with five keen arrows, Bhima, O sire, cut off with a broad-headed<br>arrow the bow of the Suta's son. The cheerless Karna then, O Bharata,<br>taking up another bow shrouded Bhimasena on all sides with his arrows.<br>Then Bhima, slaying Karna's steeds and charioteer, laughed a laugh,<br>having thus counteracted Karna's feats. Then that bull amongst men, viz.,<br>Bhima, cut off with his arrows the bow of Karna. That bow, O king, of<br>loud twang, and the back of whose staff was decked with gold, fell down<br>(from his hand). Then the mighty car-warrior Karna alighted from his car<br>and taking up a mace in that battle wrathfully hurled it at Bhima.<br>Beholding that mace, O king, impetuously coursing towards him, Vrikodara<br>resisted it with his arrows in the sight of all thy troops. Then the son<br>of Pandu, gifted with great prowess and exerting himself with great<br>activity, shot a thousand arrows at the Suta's son, desirous of taking<br>the latter's life. Karna, however, in the dreadful battle, resisting all<br>those shafts with his own, cut off Bhima's armour also with his arrows.<br>And then he pierced Bhima with five and twenty small shafts in the sight<br>of all the troops. All this seemed exceedingly wonderful. Then, O<br>monarch, Bhima, excited with rage, sped nine straight shafts at the<br>Suta's son. Those keen shafts, piercing through Karna's coat of mail and<br>right arm, entered the earth like snakes into an ant-hill. Shrouded with<br>showers of shafts shot from Bhimasena's bow, Karna once more turned his<br>back upon Bhimasena. Beholding the Suta's son turn back and flying away<br>on foot, covered all over with the arrows of Kunti's son, Duryodhana<br>said, 'Go ye quickly from all sides towards the car of Radha's son.'<br>'Then, O king, thy sons, hearing these words of their brother that were<br>to them a surprise, rushed towards the son of Pandu for battle, shooting<br>showers of shafts. They were Chitra, and Upachitra, and Charuchitra, and<br>Sarasan, and Chitrayudha, and Chitravarman. All of them were well-versed<br>in every mode of warfare. The mighty car-warrior, Bhimasena, however,<br>felled each of those sons of thine thus rushing against him, with a<br>single arrow. Deprived of life, they fell down on the earth like trees<br>uprooted by a tempest. Beholding those sons of thine, all mighty<br>car-warriors, O king, thus slain, Karna, with tearful face, recollected<br>the word of Vidura. Mounting upon another car that was duly equipped,<br>Karna, endued with great prowess, quickly proceeded against the son of<br>Pandu in battle. Piercing each other with whetted arrows, equipped with<br>wings of gold, the two warriors looked resplendent like two masses of<br>clouds penetrated by the rays of the sun. Then the son of Pandu, excited<br>with rage, cut off the armour of Suta's son with six and thirty<br>broad-headed arrows of great sharpness and fierce energy. The<br>mighty-armed Suta's son also, O bull of Bharata's race, pierced the son<br>of Kunti with fifty straight arrows. The two warriors then, smeared with<br>red sandal-paste with many a wound caused by each other's arrows, and<br>covered also with gore, looked resplendent like the risen sun and the<br>moon. Their coats of mail cut off by means of arrows, and their bodies<br>covered with blood, Karna and Bhima then looked like a couple of snakes<br>just freed from their sloughs. Indeed, those two tigers among men mangled<br>each other with their arrows, like two tigers mangling each other with<br>their teeth. The two heroes incessantly showered their shafts, like two<br>masses of clouds pouring torrents of rain. Those two chastisers of foes<br>tore each other's body with their arrows, like two elephants tearing each<br>other with the points of their tusks. Roaring at each other and showering<br>their arrows upon each other, causing their cars to trace beautiful<br>circles. They resembled a couple of mighty bulls roaring at each other in<br>the presence of a cow in her season. Indeed, those two lions among men<br>then looked like a couple of mighty lions endued with eyes red in wrath,<br>these two warriors endued with great energy fought on like Sakra and<br>Virochana's son (Prahlada). Then, O king, the mighty-armed Bhima, as he<br>stretched his bow with his two hands, looked like a cloud charged with<br>lightning. Then mighty Bhima-cloud, having the twang of the bow for its<br>thunder and incessant showers of arrows for its rainy downpour, covered,<br>O king, the Karna-mountain. And once more Pandu's son, Bhima of terrible<br>prowess, O Bharata, shrouded Karna with a thousand shafts shot from his<br>bow. And as he shrouded Karna with his winged shafts, equipped with Kanka<br>feathers, thy sons witnessed his extra ordinary prowess. Gladdening<br>Partha himself and the illustrious Kesava, Satyaki and the two protectors<br>of (two) wheels (of Arjuna's car), Bhima fought even thus with Karna.<br>Beholding the perseverance of Bhima who knew his own self, thy sons, O<br>monarch, all became cheerless.'"
