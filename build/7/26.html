                            "Sanjaya said, 'At Partha's desire, Krishna then urged his white steeds,<br>fleet as the mind and covered in golden armour, towards Drona's<br>divisions. While that foremost one of the Kurus was thus proceeding<br>towards his brothers who were exceedingly afflicted by Drona, Susarman<br>with his brothers, followed him behind, desirous of battle. The<br>ever-victorious Arjuna then addressed Krishna, saying, 'O thou of<br>unfading glory, this Susarman here, with his brothers, challengeth me to<br>battle! O slayer of foes, our host, again, is broken (by Drona) towards<br>the north. In consequence of these Samsaptakas, my heart wavers today as<br>to whether I should do this or that. Shall I slay the Samsaptakas now, or<br>protect from harm my own troops already afflicted by the foe? Know this<br>to be what I am thinking of, viz., 'Which of these would be better for<br>me?' Thus addressed by him, he of Dasarha's race, turned back the car,<br>and took the son of Pandu to where the ruler of the Trigartas was. Then<br>Arjuna pierced Susarman with seven shafts, and cut off both his bow and<br>standard with a couple of sharp arrows. He then, with six arrows, quickly<br>despatched the brothers of Trigarta king to Yama's abode.[56] Then<br>Susarman, aiming Arjuna, hurled at him a dart made wholly of iron and<br>looking like a snake, and aiming Vasudeva, hurled a lance at him. Cutting<br>off that dart with three arrows and that lance also with three other<br>arrows, Arjuna, by means of his arrowy showers, deprived Susarman of his<br>senses on his car. Then advancing fiercely (towards thy division),<br>scattering showers of arrows, like Vasava pouring rain, none among thy<br>troops, O king, ventured to oppose. Like a fire consuming heaps of straw<br>as it advances, Dhananjaya advanced, scorching all the mighty<br>car-warriors among the Kauravas by means of his arrows. Like a living<br>creature incapable of bearing the touch of fire, thy troops could not<br>bear the irresistible impetuosity of that intelligent son of Kunti.<br>Indeed, the son of Pandu, overwhelming the hostile host by means of his<br>arrows, came upon the king of the Pragjyotishas, O monarch, like Garuda<br>swooping down (upon his prey). He then held in his hands that Gandiva<br>which in battle was beneficial to the innocent Pandavas and baneful to<br>all foes, for the destruction of Kshatriyas brought about, O king, by the<br>fault of thy son who had recourse to deceitful dice for accomplishing his<br>end. Agitated by Partha thus, thy host then, O king, broke like a boat<br>when it strikes against a rock. Then ten thousand bowmen, brave and<br>fierce, firmly resolved to conquer, advanced (to encounter Arjuna). With<br>dauntless hearts, those mighty car-warriors all surrounded him. Capable<br>of bearing any burden, howsoever heavy in battle, Partha took up that<br>heavy burden. As an angry elephant of sixty years, with rent temples,<br>crushes an assemblage of lotus stalks, even so did Partha crush that<br>division of thy army. And when that division was being thus crushed, king<br>Bhagadatta, on that same elephant of his, impetuously rushed towards<br>Arjuna. Thereupon, Dhananjaya, that tiger among men, staying on his car,<br>received Bhagadatta. That encounter between Arjuna's car and Bhagadatta's<br>elephant was fierce in the extreme. Those two heroes, viz., Bhagadatta<br>and Dhananjaya, then coursed on the field, the one on his car and the<br>other on his elephant, both of which were equipped according to the rules<br>of science. Then Bhagadatta, like the lord Indra, from his elephant<br>looking like a mass of clouds, poured on Dhananjaya showers of arrows.<br>The valiant son of Vasava, however, with his arrows, cut off those arrowy<br>showers of Bhagadatta before they could reach him. The king of the<br>Pragjyotishas, then, baffling that arrowy shower of Arjuna, struck both<br>Partha and Krishna, O king, with many shafts and overwhelming both of<br>them with a thick shower of shafts, Bhagadatta then urged his elephant<br>for the destruction of Krishna and Partha. Beholding that angry elephant<br>advancing like Death himself, Janardana quickly moved his car in such a<br>way as to keep the elephant on his left. Dhananjaya, although he thus got<br>the opportunity of slaying that huge elephant with its rider from the<br>back, wished not yet to avail himself of it, remembering the rules of<br>fair fight. The elephant, however, coming upon other elephants and cars<br>and steeds, O king, despatched them all to Yama's abode. Beholding this,<br>Dhananjaya was filled with rage.
