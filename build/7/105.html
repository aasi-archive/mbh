                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'After Arjuna had got the ruler of the Sindhus<br>within sight, what, O Sanjaya, did the Panchalas, attacked by<br>Bharadwaja's son, do, encountering the Kurus?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, In the afternoon of that day, O monarch, in the battle<br>that took place between the Panchalas and the Kurus, Drona became, as it<br>were, the stake (for which each fought on to win or lose). The Panchalas,<br>O sire, desirous of slaying Drona, cheerfully uttered loud roars and shot<br>dense showers of arrows. Indeed, that encounter between the Panchalas and<br>the Kurus, fierce, awful, and highly wonderful as it was, resembled that<br>in days of yore between the gods and the Asuras. Indeed, all the<br>Panchalas with the Pandavas, obtaining Drona's car (within reach) used<br>many mighty weapons, desirous of piercing through his array. Car-warriors<br>stationed on their cars, causing the earth to shake under them, and<br>showering their arrowy downpours, rushed towards Drona's car, without<br>much speed. Then that mighty car-warrior among the Kaikeyas, viz.,<br>Vrihatkshatra, incessantly scattering keen shafts that resembled the<br>thunder in force, proceeded towards Drona. Then Kshemadhurti of great<br>fame quickly rushed against Vrihatkshatra, shooting keen arrows by<br>thousands. Beholding this, that bull among the Chedis, viz.,<br>Dhrishtaketu, endued with great might, quickly proceeded against<br>Kshemadhurti, like Mahendra proceeding against the Asura Samvara. Seeing<br>him rush with great impetuosity, like the Destroyer himself with<br>wide-open mouth, that mighty bowman viz., Viradhanwan, proceeded against<br>him with great speed. King Yudhishthira staying there at the head of his<br>division from desire of victory, was resisted by valiant Drona himself.<br>Thy son Vikarna, O lord, endued with great prowess, proceeded against the<br>rushing Nakula of great prowess, that warrior accomplished in battle.<br>That scorcher of foes, viz., Durmukha, covered the advancing Sahadeva<br>with many thousands of swiftly-coursing shafts. The heroic Vyughradatta<br>resisted that tiger among men, viz., Satyaki making him repeatedly<br>tremble by means of his sharp and keen-pointed shafts. The son of<br>Somadatta resisted the (five) sons of Draupadi, those tigers among men,<br>those great car-warriors, wrathfully shooting mighty shafts. That mighty<br>car-warrior, viz., Rishyasringa's fierce son (the Rakshasa Alamvusha), of<br>awful mien, resisted the advancing Bhimasena filled with wrath. The<br>encounter that then took place between that man and Rakshasa resembled, O<br>king, the battle in days of yore between Rama, and Ravana. Then, O<br>Bharata, Yudhishthira, that chief of the Bharatas, struck Drona with<br>ninety straight shafts in all his vital parts. Enraged by the famous son<br>of Kunti, Drona struck him in return, O chief of the Bharatas, in the<br>centre of the chest with five and twenty shafts. And once more, in the<br>very sight of all the bowmen, Drona struck him, with his steeds,<br>charioteer, and standard, with twenty shafts. Pandu's son, of virtuous<br>soul, displaying great lightness of hand, baffled with his own arrowy<br>showers those arrows shot by Drona, Then that great bowman Drona, filled<br>with rage, cut off the bow of the high souled king Yudhishthira the just.<br>Then that great car-warrior (viz., the son of Bharadwaja) speedily<br>covered the bowless Yudhishthira with many thousands of shafts. Beholding<br>the king made invisible by the shafts of Bharadwaja's son, all thought<br>that Yudhishthira was dead, and some thought that the king had fled<br>before Drona. And many cried out, O king, saying, 'Alas the king hath<br>been slain by the high-souled Brahmana.' Then, king Yudhishthira the<br>just, fallen into great distress, having laid aside that bow cut off by<br>Bharadwaja's son in battle took up another excellent, bright and tougher<br>bow. And that hero then cut off in that encounter all those shafts shot<br>in thousands by Drona. All this seemed exceedingly wonderful. Having cut<br>off those shafts, O king, Yudhishthira, with eyes red in wrath, took up<br>in that battle a dart, capable of riving even a mountain. Equipped with a<br>golden staff, of awful mien, having eight bells attached to it, and<br>exceedingly terrible, the mighty Yudhishthira, taking it up, uttered a<br>loud roar. And with that roar, O Bharata, the son of Pandu inspired all<br>creatures with fear. Beholding that dart upraised by king Yudhishthira<br>the just, all creatures, as if with one accord, said, 'Good be to Drona!'<br>Hurled from the king's arms, that dart resembling a snake just freed from<br>its slough, coursed towards Drona, illumining the welkin and all the<br>directions cardinal and subsidiary, like a she-snake with fiery mouth,<br>Beholding it coursing towards him impetuously, O king, Drona, that<br>foremost of all persons acquainted with weapons invoked into existence<br>the weapon called Brahma. That weapon, reducing that dart of terrible<br>mien into dust, coursed towards the car of the illustrious son of Pandu.<br>Then, O sire, king Yudhishthira of' great wisdom baffled that weapon of<br>Drona, thus coursing towards him by himself invoking the Brahma weapon.<br>And then piercing Drona himself in that battle with five straight shafts,<br>he cut off, with a sharp razor-faced shaft, the large bow of Drona. Then<br>Drona, that grinder of Kshatriyas, throwing aside that broken bow, hurled<br>with great force, O sire, a mace at the son of Dharma. Beholding that<br>mace impetuously coursing towards him, Yudhishthira, O chastiser of foes,<br>filled with rage, took up a mace. Then those two maces, both hurled with<br>great force, encountering each other in mid-air, produced by their<br>collision sparks of fire and then fell down on the earth. Then Drona,<br>filled with fury, slew, O sire, the steeds of Yudhishthira, with four<br>excellent shafts of keen points. And with another broad-headed shaft he<br>cut off he king's bow resembling a pole erected to the honour of Indra.<br>And with another shaft he cut off the standard of Yudhishthira, and with<br>three he afflicted the Pandava himself. Then king Yudhishthira, speedily<br>jumping down from that steedless car, stood weaponless and with arms<br>upraised, O bull of Bharata's race! Beholding him carless, and especially<br>weaponless, Drona, O lord, stupefied his foes, rather the whole army.<br>Firmly adhering to his vow, and endued with great lightness of hands,<br>Drona shot showers of sharp shafts and rushed towards the king, like a<br>furious lion towards a deer. Beholding Drona, that slayer of foes, rush<br>towards him, cries of Oh and Alas suddenly rose from the Pandava army.'<br>And many cried out, saying, 'The king is slain by Bharadwaja's son.' Loud<br>wails of this kind were heard, O Bharata, among the Pandava troops.<br>Meanwhile, king Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, getting up on the car of<br>Sahadeva, retreated from the field, borne away by swift steeds.'"
