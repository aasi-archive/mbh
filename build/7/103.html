                            "Sanjaya said, 'Thy warriors, as soon as they beheld those foremost of<br>persons of the Vrishni-Andhaka and the Kuru races, lost no time, each<br>striving to be first, in proceeding against them from a desire of<br>slaughtering them. And so Vijaya also rushed against those foes of his.<br>On their great cars, decked with gold, cased in tiger-skins, producing<br>deep rattle, and resembling blazing fire, they rushed, illumining the ten<br>points of the compass, armed, O king, with bows, the backs of whose<br>staves were decked with gold, and which in consequence of their<br>splendour, were incapable of being looked at, and uttering loud cries,<br>and drawn by angry steeds. Bhurisravas, and Sala and Karna, and<br>Vrishasena, and Jayadratha, and Kripa. and the ruler of the Madras, and<br>that foremost of car-warriors, viz., the son of Drona. these eight great<br>car-warriors, as if devouring the skies (as they proceeded) illuminated<br>the ten points of the compass with their splendid cars, cased in<br>tiger-skins and decked with golden moons. Clad in mail, filled with wrath<br>and mounted upon their cars the rattle of which resembled the roar of<br>masses of clouds, they covered Arjuna on every side with a shower of<br>sharp shafts. Beautiful steeds of the best breed, endued with great<br>speed, bearing those great car-warriors, looked resplendent as they<br>illumined the points of the compass. Their cars drawn by foremost steeds<br>of great fleetness were of diverse countries and of diverse species, some<br>bred in mountainous regions, some in rivers, and some in the country of<br>the Sindhus, many foremost of car-warriors among the Kurus desirous, O<br>king, of rescuing thy son quickly rushed towards Dhananjaya's car from<br>every side. Those foremost of men, taking up their conchs blew them,<br>filling O king, the welkin and the earth with her seas (with that blare).<br>Then those foremost ones among the gods, viz., Vasudeva and Dhananjaya,<br>also blew their foremost of conchs on earth. The son of Kunti blew<br>Devadatta, and Kesava blew Panchajanya. The loud blast of Devadatta, sent<br>forth by Dhananjaya, filled the earth, the welkin, and ten points of the<br>compass. And so Panchajanya also blown by Vasudeva, surpassing all<br>sounds, filled the sky and the earth. And while that awful and fierce<br>noise continued, a noise that inspired the timid with fear and the brave<br>with cheers, and while drums and Jharjharas, and cymbals and Mridangas, O<br>great king, were beat by thousands, great car-warriors invited to the<br>Kuru side and solicitous of Dhananjaya's welfare, those great bowmen,<br>filled with rage and unable to bear the loud blast of Arjuna's and<br>Krishna's conchs, those kings from diverse realms supported by their<br>respective troops, in rage blew their great conchs, desiring to answer<br>with their own blasts the blasts of Kesava and Arjuna. The Kuru army<br>then, urged forward by that blare of conchs, had its car-warriors,<br>elephants, and steeds filled with anxiety and fear. Indeed, O lord, that<br>host looked as if they that comprised it were ill. The agitated Kuru<br>host, echoing with that blare of conchs blown by brave warriors, seemed<br>to be like the welkin resounding with the noise of thunder and fallen<br>down (through some convulsion of nature).[146] That loud uproar, O<br>monarch, resounded through the ten points and frightened that host like<br>critical incidents at the end of the Yuga frightening all living<br>creatures. Then, Duryodhana and those eight great car-warriors appointed<br>for the protection of Jayadratha all surrounded the son of Pandu. The son<br>of Drona struck Vasudeva with three and seventy shafts, and Arjuna<br>himself with three broad-headed shafts, and his standard and (four)<br>steeds with five others. Beholding Janardana pierced, Arjuna, filled with<br>rage, struck Aswatthaman with hundred shafts. Then piercing Karna with<br>ten arrows and Vrishasena with three, the valiant Dhananjaya cut off<br>Salya's bow with arrows fixed on the string, at the handle. Salya then,<br>taking up another bow, pierced the son of Pandu. And Bhurisravas pierced<br>him with three arrows whetted on stone, and equipped with golden wings.<br>And Karna pierced him with two and thirty arrows, and Vrishasena with<br>seven. And Jayadratha pierced Arjuna with three and seventy shafts and<br>Kripa pierced him with ten. And the ruler of the Madras also pierced<br>Phalguna in that battle with ten arrows. And the son of Drona pierced him<br>with sixty arrows. And he, once more, pierced Partha with five arrows,<br>and Vasudeva with twenty. Then the tiger among men, viz., Arjuna owning<br>white steeds and having Krishna for his driver, pierced each of those<br>warriors in return, displaying the lightness of his hand. Piercing Karna<br>with a dozen shafts and Vrishasena with three, Partha cut off Salya's bow<br>at the handle. And piercing the son of Somadatta with three arrows and<br>Salya with ten, he pierced Kripa with five and twenty arrows, and the<br>ruler of the Sindhus with a hundred, Partha struck Drona's son with<br>seventy arrows. Then Bhurisravas filled with rage, cut off the goad in<br>Krishna's hand, and struck Arjuna with three and twenty shafts. Then<br>Dhananjaya, of white steeds, filled with rage, mangled those enemies of<br>his with hundreds upon hundreds of arrows, like a mighty tempest tearing<br>masses of clouds.'"
