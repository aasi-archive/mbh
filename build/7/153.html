                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Having said all those words unto my son,<br>Duryodhana, who is ever disobedient to my commands, when that mighty<br>bowman endued with great strength, viz., the preceptor Drona, penetrated<br>in wrath into the Pandava host, and when that hero, stationed on his car,<br>careered over the field, how did the Pandavas check his course? Who<br>protected the right wheel of the preceptor's car in that dreadful battle?<br>Who also protected his left when he fiercely slaughtered the foe? Who<br>were those brave warriors that followed that fighting hero at his back?<br>Who were those, then, that stood in front of that car-warrior? When that<br>unvanquished and great bowman, that foremost of all bearers of weapons,<br>dancing along the track of his car, entered the Pandavas host, I think,<br>his foes felt an excessive and unseasonable cold. I think, they trembled<br>like kine exposed to wintry blasts. How did that bull among car-warriors,<br>who consumed all the troops of the Panchalas like a raging conflagration,<br>meet with his death?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Having slain the ruler of the Sindhus in the evening,<br>Partha, after his meeting with Yudhishthira and the great bowman, viz.,<br>Satyaki, both proceeded towards Drona. Then Yudhishthira, and Bhimasena,<br>the son of Pandu, each with a separate division of the army, quickly<br>proceeded against Drona. Similarly, the intelligent Nakula, and the<br>invincible Sahadeva, and Dhrishtadyumna with his own division, and<br>Virata, and the ruler of the Salwas, with a large force, proceeded<br>against Drona in battle. Similarly, king Drupada, the father of<br>Dhrishtadyumna, protected by the Panchalas proceeded, O king, against<br>Drona. And the sons of Draupadi, and the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha,<br>accompanied by their forces, proceeded against Drona of great splendour.<br>The Prabhadraka-Panchalas also six thousand strong, and all effectual<br>smiters, proceeded against Drona placing Sikhandin at their head. Other<br>foremost of men and mighty car-warriors among the Pandavas, uniting<br>together, O bull among men, proceeded against Drona. When those heroic<br>warriors, O bull among the Bharatas, proceeded to battle, the night<br>became pitch dark, enhancing the terrors of the timid. And during that<br>hour of darkness, O king, many were the warriors that laid down their<br>lives. And that night also proved the death of many elephants and steeds<br>and foot-soldiers. On that night of pitch darkness, yelling jackals<br>everywhere inspired great fear with their blazing mouths. Fierce owls,<br>perching on the standards of Kauravas and hooting therefrom, foreboded<br>fears. Then, O king, a fierce uproar arose among the troops. Mingling<br>with the loud beat of drums and cymbals, grunts of elephants, neighings<br>of steeds, and stampings of horse-hoofs, that uproar spread everywhere.<br>Then, in that hour of evening, fierce was the battle that took place<br>between Drona, O king, and all of the Srinjayas. The world having been<br>enveloped in darkness, nothing could be noticed. The welkin was covered<br>with the dust raised by the combatants. Blood of man and horse and<br>elephant mingled together. The earthy dust then disappeared. All of us<br>became perfectly cheerless. During that night, like the sounds of a<br>burning forest of bamboos on a mountain, frightful sounds were heard of<br>clashing weapons. With the sounds of Mridangas and Anakas and Vallakis<br>and Patahas,[192] with the shouts (of human beings) and the neigh (of<br>steeds), a dreadful confusion set in everywhere, O lord! When the field<br>of battle was enveloped in darkness, friends, O king, could not be<br>distinguished from foes. All were possessed with a madness in that night.<br>The earthen dust that had arisen, O king, was soon allayed with showers<br>of blood. Then, in consequence of golden coats of mail and the bright<br>ornaments of the warriors, that darkness was dispelled. The Bharata host<br>then, adorned with gems and gold (and abounding with darts and<br>standards), looked like the firmament in the night, O bull of Bharata's<br>race, bespangled with stars. The field of battle then resounded with the<br>yells of jackals and the cawings of crows, with the grunts of elephants,<br>and the shouts and cries of the warriors. Those sounds, mingling<br>together, produced a loud uproar, making the hair stand on end. That<br>uproar filled all the points of the compass like the report of Indra's<br>thunder. At dead of night, the Bharata host seemed illuminated with the<br>Angadas, the ear-rings, the cuirasses, and the weapons of combatants.<br>There elephants and cars, adorned with gold, looked in that night like<br>clouds charged with lightning. Swords and darts and maces and scimitars<br>and clubs and lances and axes, as they fell, looked like dazzling flashes<br>of fire. Duryodhana was the gust of wind that was the precursor (of that<br>tempest-like host). Cars and elephants constituted its dry clouds. The<br>loud noise of drums and other instruments formed the peal of its<br>thunders. Abounding with standards, bows formed to lightning flashes.<br>Drona and the Pandavas formed its pouring clouds. Scimitars and darts and<br>maces constituted its thunders. Shafts formed its downpour, and weapons<br>(of other kinds) its incessant gusts of wind. And the winds that blew<br>were both exceedingly hot and exceedingly cold. Terrible, stunning and<br>fierce, it was destructive of life. There was nothing that could afford<br>shelter from it.[193] Combatants, desirous of battle entered into that<br>frightful host on that dreadful night resounding with terrible noises,<br>enhancing the fears of the timid and the delight of heroes. And during<br>the progress of that fierce and dreadful battle in the night, the Pandus<br>and the Srinjayas, united together, rushed in wrath against Drona. All<br>these, however, O king, that advanced right against the illustrious<br>Drona, were either obliged to turn back or despatched to the abode of<br>Yama. Indeed, on that night, Drona alone pierced with his shafts,<br>elephants in thousands and cars in tens of thousands and millions of<br>millions of foot-soldiers and steeds.'"
