                            "Dhritarashtra said, A mere child in years, brought up in great luxury,<br>proud of the strength of his arms, accomplished in battle, endued with<br>great heroism, the perpetuator of his race, and prepared to lay down his<br>life&#8212;when Abhimanyu penetrated into the Katirava army, borne on his<br>three-years old steeds of spirited mettle, was there any of great<br>warriors, in Yudhishthira's army, that followed the son of Arjuna?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Yudhishthira and Bhimasena, and Sikhandin and Satyaki,<br>and the twins Nakula and Sahadeva, and Dhrishtadyumna and Virata, and<br>Drupada, and Kekaya, and Dhristaketu, all filled with wrath, and the<br>Matsya warrior, rushed to battle. Indeed, Abhimanyu's sires accompanied<br>by his maternal uncles, those smiters of foes, arrayed in order of battle<br>rushed along the self-same path that Abhimanyu had created, desirous of<br>rescuing him.. Beholding those heroes rushing, thy troops turned away<br>from the fight. Seeing then that vast army of thy son turning away from<br>the fight, the son-in-law of great energy rushed to rally them. Indeed,<br>king Jayadratha, the son of the ruler of the Sindhus, checked, with all<br>their followers, the Parthas, desirous of rescuing their son. That fierce<br>and great bowman, viz. the son of Vriddhakshatra, invoking into existence<br>celestial weapons resisted the Pandavas, like an elephant sporting in a<br>low land.'[70]<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'I think, Sanjaya, that heavy was the burthen thrown<br>upon the ruler of the Sindhus, inasmuch as alone he had to resist the<br>angry Pandavas desirous of rescuing their son. Exceedingly wonderful, I<br>think, was the might and heroism of the ruler of the Sindhus. Tell me<br>what the high-souled warrior's prowess was and how he accomplished that<br>foremost of feats. What gifts did he make, what libations had he poured,<br>what sacrifices had he performed, what ascetic austerities had he well<br>undergone, in consequence of which, single-handed, he succeeded in<br>checking Parthas excited with wrath?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'On the occasion of his insult to Draupadi, Jayadratha was<br>vanquished by Bhimasena. From a keen sense of his humiliation, the king<br>practised the severest of ascetic austerities, desirous of a boon.<br>Restraining his senses from all objects dear to them, bearing hunger,<br>thirst and heat, he reduced his body till his swollen veins became<br>visible. Uttering the eternal words of the Veda, he paid his adoration to<br>the god Mahadeva. That illustrious Deity, always inspired with compassion<br>for his devotees, at last, became kind towards him. Indeed, Hara,<br>appearing in a dream unto the ruler of the Sindhus, addressed him, saying<br>'Solicit the boon thou desirest. I am gratified with thee, O Jayadratha!<br>What dost thou desire?' Thus addressed by Mahadeva, Jayadratha, the ruler<br>of the Sindhus, bowed down unto him and said with joined palms and<br>restrained soul, 'Alone, on a single car, I shall check in battle all the<br>sons of Pandu, endued though they are with terrible energy and prowess.'<br>Even this, O Bharata, was the boon he had solicited. Thus prayed to that<br>foremost of the deities said unto Jayadratha, 'O amiable one, I grant<br>thee the boon. Except Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, thou shalt in battle<br>check the four other sons of Pandu.' 'So be it,' said Jayadratha unto<br>that Lord of the gods and then awoke, O monarch, from his slumber. In<br>consequence of that boon which he had received and of the strength also<br>of his celestial weapons, Jayadratha, single-handed, held in check the<br>entire army of the Pandavas. The twang of his bow-string and the slaps of<br>his palms inspired the hostile Kshatriyas with fear, filling thy troops,<br>at the same time with delight. And the Kshatriyas (of the Kuru army),<br>beholding that the burthen was taken up by the ruler of the Sindhus,<br>rushed with loud shouts, O monarch, to that part of the field where<br>Yudhishthira's army was.'"
