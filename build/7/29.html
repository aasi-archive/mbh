                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'When those divisions (of mine), O Sanjaya, were<br>broken and routed, and all of you retreated quickly from the field, what<br>became the state of your minds? The rallying of ranks when broken and<br>flying away without beholding a spot whereon to stand, is always<br>exceedingly difficult. Tell me all about it, O Sanjaya!'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, [Although thy troops were broken], yet, O monarch, many<br>foremost of heroes in the world, inspired by the desire of doing good to<br>thy son and of maintaining their own reputation, followed Drona. In that<br>dreadful pass, they fearlessly followed their commander, achieving<br>meritorious feats against the Pandava troops with weapons upraised, and<br>Yudhishthira within accessible distance.[58] Taking advantage of an error<br>of Bhimasena of great energy and of heroic Satyaki and Dhrishtadyumna, O<br>monarch, the Kuru leaders fell upon the Pandava Army.[59] The Panchalas<br>urged their troops, saying, 'Drona, Drona!' Thy sons, however, urged all<br>the Kurus, saying, 'Let not Drona be slain. Let not Drona be slain!' One<br>side saying, 'Slay Drona', 'Slay Drona,' and the other saying, 'Let not<br>Drona be slain, 'Let not Drona be slain,' the Kurus and the Pandavas<br>seemed to gamble, making Drona their stake. Dhrishtadyumna, the prince of<br>the Panchalas, proceeded to the side of all those Panchala car-warriors<br>whom Drona sought to crush. Thus no rule was observed as to the<br>antagonist one night select for battling with him. The strife became<br>dreadful. Heroes encountered heroes, uttering loud shouts Their foes<br>could not make the Pandavas tremble. On the other hand, recollecting all<br>their woes, the latter made the ranks of their enemies tremble. Though<br>possessed of modesty, yet excited with rage and vindictiveness, and urged<br>by energy and might, they approached that dreadful battle, reckless of<br>their very lives for slaying Drona. That encounter of heroes of<br>immeasurable energy, sporting in fierce battle making life itself the<br>stake, resembled the collision of iron against adamant. The oldest men<br>even could not recollect whether they had seen or heard of a battle as<br>fierce as that which took place on this occasion. The earth in that<br>encounter, marked with great carnage and afflicted with the weight of<br>that vast host, began to tremble. The awful noise made by the Kuru army<br>agitated and tossed by the foe, paralysing the very welkin, penetrated<br>into the midst of even the Pandava host. Then Drona, coming upon the<br>Pandava divisions by thousands, and careering over the field, broke them<br>by means of his whetted shafts. When these were being thus crushed by<br>Drona of wonderful achievements, Dhrishtadyumna, the generalissimo of the<br>Pandava host, filled with rage himself checked Drona. The encounter that<br>we beheld between Drona and the prince of the Panchalas was highly<br>wonderful. It is my firm conviction that it has no parallel.<br><br>"Then Nila, resembling a veritable fire, his arrows constituting its<br>sparks and his bow its flame, began to consume the Kuru ranks, like a<br>conflagration consuming heaps of dry grass. The valiant son of Drona, who<br>from before had been desirous of an encounter with him, smilingly<br>addressed Nila as the latter came consuming the troops, and said unto him<br>these polite words,[60] 'O Nila, what dost thou gain by consuming so many<br>common soldiers with thy arrowy flames? Fight with my unaided self, and<br>filled with rage, strike me.' Thus addressed, Nila, the brightness of<br>whose face resembled the splendour of a full-blown lotus, pierced<br>Aswatthaman, whose body resembled an assemblage of lotuses and whose eyes<br>were like lotus-petals with his shafts. Deeply and suddenly pierced by<br>Nila, Drona's son with three broad-headed arrows, cut off his<br>antagonist's bow and standard and umbrella. Quickly jumping down from his<br>car, Nila, then, with a shield and an excellent sword, desired to sever<br>from Aswatthaman's trunk his head like a bird (bearing away its prey in<br>its talons). Drona's son, however, O sinless one, by means of a bearded<br>arrow, cut off, from his antagonist's trunk, his head graced with a<br>beautiful nose and decked with excellent ear-rings, and which rested on<br>elevated shoulders. That hero, then, the brightness of whose face<br>resembled the splendour of the full moon and whose eyes were like<br>lotus-petals, whose stature was tall, and complexion like that of the<br>lotus, thus slain, fell down on the earth. The Pandava host then, filled<br>with great grief, began to tremble, when the Preceptor's son thus slew<br>Nila of blazing energy. The great car-warriors of the Pandavas, O sire,<br>all thought, 'Alas, how would Indra's son (Arjuna) be able to rescue us<br>from the foe, when that mighty warrior is engaged on the southern part of<br>the field in slaughtering the remnant of the Samsaptakas and the Narayana<br>force?'"
