                            "Drona said, 'I know the Vedas with their six branches. I know also the<br>science of human affairs. I am acquainted also with the Saiva weapon, and<br>diverse other species of weapons. Endeavouring to actually display all<br>those virtues which ye, desirous of victory, have attributed to me, I<br>will fight with the Pandavas. I will not, however, O king, be able to<br>slay the son of Prishata. O bull among men, he hath been created for my<br>slaughter. I will fight with the Pandavas, and slay the Somakas. As<br>regards the Pandavas, they will not fight with me with cheerful hearts.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus permitted by Drona, the son, O king, then made<br>him the commander of his forces according to the rites prescribed in the<br>ordinance. And the kings (in the Katirava army) headed by Duryodhana<br>performed the investiture of Drona in the command of the forces, like the<br>celestials headed by India in days of yore performing the investiture of<br>Skanda. After Drona's installation in the command, the joy of the army<br>expressed itself by the sound of drums and the loud blare of conchs. Then<br>with cries such as greet the ears en a festive day, with auspicious<br>invocations by Brahmanas gratified with cries of Jaya uttered by foremost<br>of Brahmanas, and with the dance of mimes, Drona was duly honoured. And<br>Kaurava warriors regarded the Pandayas as already vanquished.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued. 'Then that mighty car-warrior, viz., Bharadwaja's<br>son, having obtained the command, arrayed the troops in order of battle,<br>and went out with thy sons from desire of fighting the foe. And the ruler<br>of the Sindhus, and the chief of the Kalingas, and thy son Vikarna, clad<br>in mail, took up their position on the right wing (of Drona). And Sakuni,<br>accompanied by many foremost of horsemen battling with bright lances and<br>belonging to the Gandhara tribe, proceeded, acting as their support. And<br>Kripa, and Kritavarman, and Chitrasena, and Vivinsati headed by<br>Duhsasana, strove vigorously for protecting the left wing. And the<br>Kamvojas headed by Sudakshina, and the Sakas, and the Yavanas, with<br>steeds of great fleetness, proceeded, as the latter's support. And the<br>Madras, the Trigartas the Amvashthas, the Westerners, the Northerners,<br>the Malavas, the Surasenas, the Sudras the Maladas, the Sauviras, the<br>Kaitavas, the Easterners, and the Southerners placing thy son<br>(Duryodhana) and the Suta's son (Karna) at their head, forming the rear<br>guard, gladdened warriors of their own army, added to the strength of the<br>(advancing) force, Vikartana's son Karna proceeded at the head of the<br>bowmen.[10] And his blazing and large and tall standard bearing the<br>advice of the elephant's rope, shone with an effulgence like that of the<br>Sun, gladdening his own divisions. Beholding Karna, none regarded the<br>calamity caused by Bhishma's death. And the kings, along with the Kurus,<br>all became freed from grief. And large numbers of warriors, banded<br>together, said unto one another, 'Beholding Karna on the field, the<br>Pandavas will never be able to stand in battle. Indeed, Karna is quite<br>competent to vanquish in battle the very gods with Vasava at their head.<br>What need be said, therefore, for the sons of Pandu who are destitute of<br>energy and prowess? The mighty-armed Bhishma spared the Parthas in<br>battle. Karna, however, will slay them in the fight with his keen<br>shafts.' Speaking unto one another thus and filled with joy, they<br>proceeded, applauding and worshipping the son of Radha. As regards our<br>army, it was arrayed by Drona in the form of a Sakata (vehicle); while<br>the array of our illustrious foes, O king, was in the form of a Krauncha<br>(crane), as disposed, O Bharata, by king Yudhishthira the just in great<br>cheerfulness. At the head of their array were those two foremost of<br>persons viz., Vishnu and Dhananjaya, with their banner set up, bearing<br>the device of the ape. The hump of the whole army and the refuge of all<br>bowmen, that banner of Partha, endued with immeasurable energy, as it<br>floated in the, sky, seemed to illumine the entire host of the<br>high-souled Yudhishthira. The banner of Partha, possessed of great<br>intelligence, seemed to resemble the blazing Sun that riseth at the end<br>of the Yuga for consuming the world. Amongst bowmen, Arjuna is the<br>foremost; amongst bows, Gandiva is the foremost amongst creature Vasudeva<br>is the first; and amongst all kinds of discs, Sudarsana is the first.<br>Bearing these four embodiments of energy, that car unto which were yoked<br>white steeds, took up its position in the front of the (hostile) army,<br>like the fierce discus upraised (for striking). Thus did those two<br>foremost of men stand at the very head of their respective forces, viz.,<br>Karna at the head of thy army, and Dhananjaya at the head of the hostile<br>one. Both excited with wrath, and each desirous of slaying the other,<br>Karna and Arjuna looked at each other in that battle.'<br><br>"Then when that mighty car-warrior, viz.. Bharadwaja's son, proceeded to<br>battle with great speed, the earth seemed to tremble with loud sounds of<br>wailing. Then the thick dust, raised by the wind resembling a canopy of<br>tawny silk, enveloped the sky and the sun. And though the firmament was<br>cloudless, yet a shower fell of pieces of flesh, bones, and blood. And<br>vultures and hawks and cranes and Kankas, and crows in thousands, began<br>continually to fall upon the (Kaurava) troops. And jackals yelled aloud;<br>and many fierce and terrible birds repeatedly wheeled to the left of thy<br>army, from desire of eating flesh and drinking blood,[11] and many<br>blazing meteors, illuminating (the sky), and covering large areas with<br>their tails, fell on the field with loud sound and trembling motion. And<br>the wide disc of the sun O monarch, seemed to emit flashes of lightning<br>with thundering noise, when commander of the (Kaurava) army set out.<br>These and many other portents, fierce and indicating a destruction of<br>heroes, were seen during the battle. Then commenced the encounter between<br>the troops of the Kurus and the Pandavas, desirous of slaying each other.<br>And so loud was the din that it seemed to fill the whole earth. And the<br>Pandavas and the Kauravas, enraged with each other and skilled in<br>smiting, began to strike each other with sharp weapons, from desire of<br>victory. 'Then that great bowman of blazing effulgence rushed towards the<br>troops of the Pandavas with great impetuosity, scattering hundreds of<br>sharp arrows. Then the Pandavas and the Srinjayas, beholding Drona rush<br>towards them, received him, O king, with showers upon showers (in<br>distinct sets) of arrows. Agitated and broken by Drona, the large host of<br>the Pandavas and the Panchalas broke like rows of cranes by force of the<br>wind. Invoking into existence many celestial weapons in that battle,<br>Drona, within a very short time, afflicted the Pandavas and the<br>Srinjayas. Slaughtered by Drona, like Danavas by Vasava, the Panchalas<br>headed by Dhrishtadyumna trembled in that battle. Then that mighty<br>car-warrior, viz., Yajnasena's son (Dhrishtadyumna), that hero acquainted<br>with celestial weapons, broke, with his arrowy showers, the division of<br>Drona in many places. And the mighty son of Prishata baffling with his<br>own arrowy showers the showers of arrows shot by Drona, caused a great<br>slaughter among the Kurus. The mighty-armed Drona then, rallying his men<br>in battle and gathering them together, rushed towards the son of<br>Prishata. He then shot at Prishata's son a thick shower of arrows, like<br>Maghavat excited with rage showering his arrows with great force upon the<br>Danavas, Then the Pandavas and the Srinjayas, shaken by Drona with his<br>shafts, repeatedly broke like a herd of inferior animals attacked by a<br>lion. And the mighty Drona coursed through the Pandava force like a<br>circle of fire. All this, O king, seemed highly wonderful. Mounted on his<br>own excellent car which (then) resembled a city coursing through the<br>skies, which was furnished with every necessary article according to<br>(military) science, whose banner floated on the air, whose rattle<br>resounded through the field, whose steeds were (well) urged, and the<br>staff of whose standard was bright as crystal, Drona struck terror into<br>the hearts of the enemy and caused a great slaughter among them.'"
