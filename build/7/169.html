                            "Sanjaya said, 'Against Nakula who was engaged in smiting thy host,<br>Suvala's son (Sakuni) in wrath, rushed with great impetuosity and<br>addressing him, said, 'Wait! Wait!' Each enraged with the other and each<br>desirous of slaying the other, those two heroes struck each other with<br>shafts sped from their bows drawn to their fullest stretch. Suvala's son<br>in that encounter displayed the same measure of skill that Nakula<br>displayed, O king, in shooting showers of arrows. Both pierced with<br>arrows, O king, in that battle, they looked beautiful like a couple of<br>porcupines with quills erect on their bodies. The armour of each cut off<br>by means of shafts with straight points and golden wings, and each bathed<br>in blood, those two warriors looked resplendent in that dreadful battle<br>like two beautiful and brilliant Kalpa trees, or like two flowering<br>Kinsukas on the field of battle. Indeed, O king, those two heroes in that<br>encounter, both pierced with arrows, looked beautiful like a couple of<br>Salmali trees with prickly thorns on them. Casting oblique glances at<br>each other, with eyes expanded in rage, whose corners had become red,<br>they seemed to scorch each other by those glances. Then thy<br>brother-in-law, excited with wrath, and smiling the while, pierced<br>Madri's son in the chest with a barbed arrow of keen point. Deeply<br>pierced by that great bowman, viz., thy brother-in-law, Nakula sat down<br>on the terrace of his car and swooned away. Beholding his proud foe, that<br>mortal enemy of his in that plight, Sakuni uttered a roar loud as that of<br>the clouds at the end of summer. Recovering consciousness, Nakula, the<br>son of Pandu, once more rushed against Suvala's son, like the Destroyer<br>himself of wide-open mouth. Inflamed with rage, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>he pierced Sakuni with sixty arrows, and more with a hundred long shafts<br>at the centre of his chest. He then cut off Sakuni's bow with arrow fixed<br>thereon, into two fragments, at the handle. And then cutting off in a<br>trice Sakuni's standard, he caused it to fall down on the earth. Piercing<br>next Sakuni's thigh with keen, sharp, and well-tempered shafts, Nakula,<br>the son of Pandu, caused him to fall down on the terrace of his car,<br>clasping his flag-staff, like an amorous man clasping his mistress.<br>Beholding that brother-in-law of thine laid low and deprived of<br>consciousness, O sinless one, his driver quickly bore him away from the<br>van of battle. The Parthas, then, and all their followers, uttered a loud<br>roar. Having vanquished his foes, Nakula, that scorcher of foes,<br>addressing his driver, said, 'Beat me to the host commanded by Drona.'<br>Hearing these words of Madri's son, his driver proceeded to the spot, O<br>king, where Drona was stationed.[226] Against mighty Sikhandin proceeding<br>towards Drona, Kripa resolutely advanced with great impetuosity. That<br>chastiser of foes, viz., Sikhandin, then, smiling the while, pierced with<br>nine arrows the son of Gotama thus advancing against him towards the<br>vicinity of Drona. Then the preceptor, Kripa, that benefactor of thy<br>sons, piercing Sikhandin first with five arrows, once more pierced him<br>with twenty. The combat that took place, O monarch, between them, was<br>exceedingly dreadful, like that between Samvara and the chief of the<br>celestials in the battle between the gods and the Asuras. Those heroic<br>and mighty car-warriors, both invincible in battle, covered the welkin<br>with their arrows, like clouds covering the welkin on the expiry or<br>summer. Terrible of itself, that night, O chief of the Bharatas, became<br>more terrible still to the heroic combatants engaged in battle. Indeed,<br>of terrible aspects and inspiring all sorts of fear, that night became,<br>as it were, death-night (of all creatures). Then Sikhandin, O king, cut<br>off, with a crescent-shaped arrow, the large bow of Gotama's son and shot<br>at the latter many whetted shafts. Inflamed with wrath, O monarch, Kripa<br>then sped at his antagonist a fierce dart, equipped with a golden shaft<br>and keen point, and polished by the hands of the smith. Sikhandin,<br>however, cut it off with ten shafts as it coursed towards him. That dart,<br>then, decked with gold (thus cut off), fell down on the earth. Then<br>Gautama, foremost of men, taking up another bow, O king, covered<br>Sikhandin with a large number of whetted shafts. Thus covered in that<br>battle by the illustrious son of Gotama, Sikhandin, that foremost of<br>car-warriors sank on the terrace of his car. Beholding him thus weakened,<br>Kripa in that encounter, struck him with many arrows, from desire of<br>slaying him, O Bharata! (Sikhandin then was borne away by his driver).<br>Beholding that mighty car-warrior, viz., the son of Yajnasena retreating<br>from battle, the Panchalas and the Somakas surrounded him on all sides<br>(for rescuing him). Similarly, thy sons also surrounded that foremost of<br>Brahmans, Kripa, with a large force. Then commenced a battle once more,<br>between car-warriors, O king, that struck one another. The uproar that<br>rose became loud as the roaring of clouds, O Bharata, caused by rushing<br>horsemen and elephants, O monarch, smiting one another down. Then, O<br>king, the field of battle looked exceedingly fierce. With the tread of<br>rushing infantry the earth began to tremble, O monarch, like a lady<br>shaken with fear. Car-warriors, mounting on their cars, rushed<br>impetuously, attacking compeers by their thousands, O king, like crows<br>seizing winged insects (in the air). Similarly, mighty elephants with<br>winy exudation down their bodies, pursuing similar elephants, encountered<br>them, O Bharata, furiously. So also, horsemen, coming upon horsemen, and<br>foot-soldiers angrily encountered one another in that battle. At dead of<br>night, the sound of retreating and the rushing of troops and of those<br>coming again to the encounter became deafening. The blazing lamps also,<br>placed on cars and elephants and steeds, seemed, O king, large meteors<br>falling from the firmament. That night, O chief of the Bharatas,<br>lightened up by those lamps looked like day, O king, on the field of<br>battle. As the sun, encountering the thick gloom, destroys it completely,<br>even so the thick gloom of the battle was destroyed by those blazing<br>lamps. Indeed, the welkin, the earth, the cardinal and the subsidiary<br>points of the compass, enveloped by dust and darkness, became once more<br>illuminated by that light. The splendour of weapons and coats of mail,<br>and of the jewels of illustrious heroes, became overshadowed, by the<br>light of those blazing lamps. During the progress of that fierce battle<br>at night, none of the combatants, O Bharata, could know the warriors of<br>his own side. Sire, O chief of the Bharatas, slew son, and son, from<br>ignorance, slew sire, and friend slew friend. And relatives slew<br>relatives, and maternal uncles slew sisters' sons, and warriors slew<br>warriors of their own side, and foes slew their own men, in that battle,<br>O Bharata. In that dreadful nocturnal encounter, O king, all fought<br>furiously, ceasing to have any regard for one another.'"
