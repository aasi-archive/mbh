                            "Sanjaya said, 'During that fearful carnage of men and steeds and<br>elephants, Duhsasana, O king, encountered Dhrishtadyumna. Mounted upon<br>hi, golden car and exceedingly afflicted with the shafts of Duhsasana,<br>the Panchala prince wrathfully showered his shafts upon thy son's steeds.<br>Covered with the shafts of Prishata's son, O king, Duhsasana's car, with<br>standard and driver, soon became invisible. Afflicted with those showers<br>of arrows, Duhsasana, O monarch, became unable to stay before the<br>illustrious prince of the Panchalas. Forcing, by means of his shafts,<br>Duhsasana to turn back Pritha's son, scattering his arrows, proceeded<br>against Drona in that battle. At the time Hridika's son, Kritavarman,<br>with three of his uterine brothers, appeared on the scene and attempted<br>to oppose Dhrishtadyumna. Those bulls among men, however, viz., the<br>twins, Nakula and Sahadeva following in the wake of Dhrishtadyumna who<br>was thus proceeding like a blazing fire towards Drona, began to protect<br>him. Then, all those great car-warriors, endued with might and excited<br>with rage, began to strike one another, making death their goal. Of pure<br>souls and pure conduct, O king, and keeping heaven in view, they fought<br>according to righteous methods, desirous of vanquishing one another. Of<br>stainless lineage and stainless acts, and endued with great intelligence,<br>those rulers of men, keeping heaven in view, fought fair battles with<br>another. There was nothing unfair in that fight and no weapon was used<br>that was regarded as unfair. No barbed arrows, nor those called nalikas,<br>nor those that are poisoned, nor those with heads, made of horns, nor<br>those equipped with many pointed heads, nor those made of the bones of<br>bulls and elephants, nor those having two heads, nor those having rusty<br>heads, nor those that are not straight going, were used by any of<br>them.[251] All of them used simple and fair weapons and desired to win<br>both fame and region of great blessedness by fighting fairly. Between<br>those four warriors of thy army and those three of the Pandava side, the<br>battle that took place was exceedingly dreadful but divested of<br>everything unfair. Then Dhrishtadyumna, exceedingly quick in the use of<br>weapons, beholding those brave and mighty car warriors of thy army<br>checked by the twins (Nakula and Sahadeva), proceeded towards Drona.<br>Checked by those two lions among men, those four heroic warriors<br>encountered the former like the wind assailing a couple of mountains<br>(standing on their way). Each of the twins&#8212;those great car-warriors&#8212;was<br>engaged with a couple of arrows against Drona. Beholding the invincible<br>prince of the Panchalas proceeding against Drona, and those four heroes<br>(of his own army) engaged with the twins, Duryodhana, O monarch, rushed<br>to that spot, scattering showers of blood-drinking arrows. Seeing this,<br>Satyaki quickly approached the Kuru king. Those two tigers among men,<br>viz., the two descendants of Kuru and Madhu, approaching each other,<br>became desirous of striking each other in battle. Recalling to mind their<br>behaviour towards each other in childhood and reflecting with pleasure on<br>the same, they gazed at each other and smiled repeatedly. 'Then king<br>Duryodhana (mentally), blaming his own conduct, addressed his ever dear<br>friend Satyaki, and said, 'Fie on wrath, O friend, and fie on<br>vindictiveness! Fie on Kshatriya usage, and fie on might and prowess,<br>since thou aimest thy weapons at me, and I too am aiming at thee, O bull<br>of Sini's race! In those days thou wert dearer to me than life itself,<br>and I also was such to thee! Alas, all those acts of childhood that I<br>remember, of both thyself and mine, became quite insignificant in the<br>field of battle! Alas, moved by wrath and convetousness, we are here<br>to-day for fighting against each other, O thou of the Satwata race!' Unto<br>him who said those words, O king, Satyaki, conversant with high weapons,<br>taking up some keen arrows, smilingly replied, 'This is no assembly, O<br>prince, nor the abode of our preceptor, where in former days we sported<br>together.' Duryodhana answered, 'Where have those sports of our childhood<br>gone, O bull of Sini's race, and, alas, how has this battle now come upon<br>us? It seems that the influence of Time is irresistible. (Urged though we<br>are) by desire of wealth, what use, however, have we of wealth that,<br>assembled together, we are now engaged in battle, moved by the avarice of<br>wealth.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Unto king Duryodhana who said so, Satyaki replied, 'This<br>has always been the usage of the Kshatriyas that they have to fight even<br>against their preceptors. If I am dear to thee, O king, then slay me<br>without any delay. Through thee, O bull of Bharata's race, I shall then<br>enter the region of the righteous. Exhibit, without delay, all thy might<br>and prowess. I do not desire to witness this great calamity of friends.'<br>Having replied and reasoned thus, Satyaki, O monarch, fearlessly and in<br>utter disregard of life, quickly advanced against Duryodhana. Beholding<br>him advance, thy son received him; indeed, O king, thy son poured on him<br>of Sini's race a perfect shower of arrows. Then commenced a terrible<br>battle between those lions of Kuru's and Madhu's races, resembling an<br>encounter between an elephant and a lion. Then Duryodhana, filled with<br>wrath, pierced the invincible Satyaki with many keen arrows, shot from<br>his bow drawn to its fullest stretch. Satyaki quickly pierced the Kuru<br>prince in return with fifty keen shafts in that battle and once more with<br>twenty, and again with ten shafts. Then, in that encounter, O king, thy<br>son, smiling the while, pierced Satyaki in return with thirty arrows shot<br>from his bowstring drawn to his ear. Shooting then a razor-headed arrow,<br>he cut off in twain the bow, with arrow fixed thereon, of Satyaki. Endued<br>with great lightness of hand, the latter then, taking up a tougher bow,<br>shot showers of shafts at thy son. As those lines of arrows advanced for<br>compassing the death of Duryodhana, the latter, O king, cut them in<br>pieces, at which the troops shouted loudly. With great swiftness, the<br>Kuru king afflicted Satyaki with three and seventy shafts, equipped with<br>wings of gold and steeped in oil and shot from his bow drawn to its<br>fullest stretch. All those arrows of Duryodhana, as also his bow, with<br>arrow fixed thereon, Satyaki quickly cut off. The Satwata hero then<br>poured showers of shafts on his antagonist. Deeply pierced by Satyaki and<br>feeling great pain, Duryodhana, O king, in great distress, sought shelter<br>in another car. Having rested awhile and refreshed himself, thy son once<br>more advanced against Satyaki, shooting showers of shafts at the latter's<br>car. Smilingly, O king, Satyaki ceaselessly shot multitudes of shafts at<br>Duryodhana's car. The shafts of both mingled with one another in the<br>welkin. In consequence of those arrows thus shot by both, falling fast on<br>every side, loud sounds, like those of a raging fire consuming a mighty<br>forest, arose there. With thousands of arrows shot by both, the earth was<br>densely covered. The welkin also became filled therewith. Beholding then<br>that foremost of car-warriors, viz., that hero of Madhu's race, to be<br>mightier than Duryodhana, Karna rushed to that spot, desirous of rescuing<br>thy son. Mighty Bhimasena, however, could not brook that attempt of<br>Karna. He, therefore, quickly proceeded against Karna, shooting<br>innumerable shafts. Cutting off all those shafts of Bhima with the<br>greatest ease, Karna cut off Bhima's bow, arrows and driver also, with<br>his own shafts. Then, Pandu's son, Bhima, filled with rage, took up a<br>mace and crushed the bow, standard, and driver of his antagonist in that<br>encounter. The mighty Bhima also broke one of the wheels of Karna's car.<br>Karna, however, stood on that car of his, which had one of his wheels<br>broken, immovable as (Meru), the king of mountains. That beautiful car of<br>his which had now only one wheel, was borne by his steeds, like the<br>single wheeled car of Surya, drawn by the seven celestial steeds.<br>Incapable of brooking the feats of Bhimasena, Karna continued to fight<br>with the latter, using diverse kinds of shafts in profusion and diverse<br>kinds of other weapons in that encounter. Bhimasena also filled with<br>wrath, continued to fight with the Suta's son. When the engagement became<br>general ant confused, (Yudhishthira) the son of Dharma, addressing all<br>the foremost of warriors among the Panchalas and the Matsyas, said, 'They<br>that are our life, they that are our heads, they amongst us that are<br>endued with great strength, those bulls among men are all engaged with<br>the Dhartarashtras. Why do ye then stand thus, as if stupefied and<br>deprived of your senses? Proceed thither where those car-warriors of my<br>army are fighting. Driving away your fears and keeping in view the duties<br>of Kshatriyas (engage in fight), for then conquering or slain ye will<br>gain desirable goals. If you prove victors, you may perform diverse<br>sacrifices with profuse gifts to Brahmanas. If, on the other hand, you<br>are slain, becoming then equals of the celestials, you will win many<br>regions of blessedness. Thus urged by the king, those heroic and mighty<br>car-warriors engaged in battle, observant of Kshatriya duties, quickly<br>proceeded against Drona. The Panchalas then, from one side, assailed<br>Drona with innumerable arrows, while others headed by Bhimasena began to<br>resist him from another side. The Pandavas had three crooked-minded<br>mighty car-warriors amongst them. They were Bhimasena and the twins<br>(Nakula and Sahadeva). These addressed Dhananjaya loudly and said, 'Rush,<br>O Arjuna, with speed and drive away the Kurus from Drona's vicinity. If<br>the preceptor can be derived of his protectors, the Panchalas may then<br>slay him easily.' Thus addressed, Partha suddenly rushed against the<br>Kauravas, while Drona rushed against the Panchalas headed by<br>Dhrishtadyumna. Indeed, on that the fifth day (of Drona's command) those<br>heroic combatants, O Bharata, were grounded and crushed with<br>great-celerity (by Bharadwaja's son.)"
