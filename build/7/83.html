                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then king Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, saluting<br>Devaki's son Janardana, and cheerfully addressed him saying 'Hast thou<br>passed the night happily, O slayer of Madhu? Are all thy perceptions<br>clear, O thou of unfading glory? Vasudeva also made similar enquiries of<br>Yudhishthira. Then the orderly came and represented that the other<br>Kshatriya warriors were waiting to be introduced. Commanded by the king,<br>the man introduced that concourse of heroes, consisting of Virata and<br>Bhimasena and Dhrishtadyumna and Satyaki, and Dhrishtaketu, the ruler of<br>the Chedis, and the mighty car-warriors, Drupada, and Sikhandin, and the<br>twins (Nakula and Sahadeva), and Chekitana, and the ruler of the<br>Kalikayas, and Yuyutsu, of Kuru's race, and Uttamaujas of the Panchalas,<br>'and Yudhamanyu, and Suvahu, and the (five) sons of Draupadi. These and<br>many other Kshatriyas, approaching that high-souled bull among the<br>Kshatriyas, sat down on excellent seats. Those mighty and high-souled<br>heroes of great splendour viz., Krishna and Yuyudhana, both sat on the<br>same seat. Then in the hearing of them all, Yudhishthira addressing the<br>lotus-eyed slayer of Madhu, and said unto him these sweet words: 'Relying<br>on thee alone, we, like the celestial one, the deity of a thousand eyes,<br>seek, victory in battle and eternal happiness. Thou art aware, O Krishna,<br>of the deprivation of our kingdom, our exile at the hands of the foe, and<br>all our diverse woes. O lord of all, O thou that art compassionate unto<br>those that are devoted to thee, upon thee wholly rests the happiness of<br>us all and our very existence, O slayer of Madhu! O thou of Vrishni's<br>race, do that by which my heart may ever rest on thee! Do also that, O<br>Lord, by which the proposed vow of Arjuna may be realised. O, rescue us<br>today from this ocean of grief and rage. O Madhava, become thou today a<br>boat unto us that are desirous of crossing (that ocean). The car-warriors<br>desirous of slaying the foe cannot, in battle, do that (for the success<br>of his object) which, O Krishna, the car-driver can do, if he exerts<br>himself carefully. O Janardana, as thou always savest the Vrishnis in all<br>calamities, even so it behoveth thee to save us from this distress, O<br>mighty-armed one! O bearer of the conch, discus, and mace, rescue the<br>sons of Pandu sunk in the fathomless and boatless Kuru-ocean, by becoming<br>a boat unto them. I bow to thee, O God of the lord of the gods, O thou<br>that art eternal, O supreme Destroyer, O Vishnu, O Jishnu, O Hari, O<br>Krishna, O Vaikuntha, O best of mate beings! Narada described thee as<br>that ancient and best of Rishis (called Narayana) that giveth boons, that<br>beareth the bow Saranga, and that is the foremost of all. O Madhava, make<br>those words true. Thus addressed in the midst of that assembly by king<br>Yudhishthira the just, Kesava, that foremost of speakers, replied unto<br>Yudhishthira in a voice deep as that of clouds charged with rain, saying,<br>'In all the worlds including that of the celestials, there is no bowman<br>equal to Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha! Possessed of great energy.<br>accomplished in weapons, of great prowess and great strength, celebrated<br>in battle, ever wrathful, and of great energy, Arjuna is the foremost of<br>men. Youthful in years bull-necked, and of long arms, he is endued with<br>great strength. Treading like a lion or a bull, and exceedingly beautiful<br>he will slay all thy foes. As regards myself, I will do that by which<br>Arjuna, the son of Kunti, may be able to consume the troops of<br>Dhritarashtra's son like a swelling conflagration. This very day, Arjuna<br>will, by his arrows despatch that vile wretch of sinful deeds, that<br>slayer of Subhadra's son, (viz., Jayadratha), to that road from which no<br>traveller comes back. Today vultures and hawks and furious jackals and<br>other carnivorous creatures will feed on his flesh. O Yudhishthira, if<br>even all the gods with Indra become his protectors today, Jayadratha will<br>still, slain in the thick of battle, repair to Yama's capital. Having<br>slain the ruler of the Sindhus, Jishnu will come to thee (in the<br>evening). Dispel thy grief and the fever (of thy heart), O king, and be<br>thou graced with prosperity.'"
