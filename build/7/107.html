                            "Sanjaya said, 'The illustrious son of Somadatta pierced each of the sons<br>of Draupadi, those great bowmen, with five arrows, and once more with<br>seven arrows. Much afflicted, O lord, by that fierce warrior, they were<br>stupefied and knew not for some time what to do. Then that crusher of<br>foes, Satanika, the son of Nakula, piercing Somadatta's son, that bull<br>among men, with a couple of arrows, uttered in joy a loud roar. The other<br>brothers then, struggling vigorously, quickly pierced the wrathful son of<br>Somadatta, each with three straight shafts. Then the illustrious son of<br>Somadatta, O monarch, sped at them five shafts, piercing each of them in<br>the chest with one shaft. Then those five brothers, thus pierced by that<br>high-souled warrior with his shafts, surrounded that hero on every side<br>and began to pierce him deeply with their shafts. Then the son of Arjuna,<br>filled with rage, despatched with keen shafts, the four steeds of<br>Saumadatti to the region of Yama. And the son of Bhimasena, cutting off<br>the bow of the illustrious son of Somadatta, uttered a loud shout and<br>pierced his foe with many sharp arrows. The son of Yudhishthira then,<br>cutting off Saumadatti's standard, felled it en the earth, while the son<br>of Nakula felled the enemy's charioteer from his niche in the car. Then<br>the son of Sahadeva, ascertaining the foe to be on the point of leaving<br>the field in consequence of the brothers, cut off, with a razor-faced<br>arrow, the head of that illustrious warrior. That head, decked with<br>ear-rings of gold, fell on the earth and adorned the field like the sun<br>of brilliant effulgence that rises at the end of the Yuga. Beholding the<br>head of the high-souled son of Somadatta thus fallen on the ground, thy<br>troops, O king, overcome with fear, fled in all directions.<br><br>"The Rakshasa Alamvusha in that battle, filled with rage, fought with the<br>mighty Bhimasena, like Ravana's son (Indrajit) with (Rama's brother)<br>Lakshmana. Beholding that Rakshasa and that human warrior engaged in<br>fight, all creatures experienced both joy and wonder. Then Bhima, O king,<br>laughing the while, pierced that wrathful prince of Rakshasa, viz.,<br>Rishyasringa's son (Alamvusha), with nine keen shafts. Then that<br>Rakshasa, thus pierced in battle, uttered a loud and awful sound, and<br>rushed, with all his followers, against Bhima. Piercing Bhima then with<br>five straight shafts, he quickly destroyed in that battle, thirty cars<br>supporting Bhima. And once more destroying four hundred cars of<br>Bhimasena, the Rakshasa pierced Bhimasena himself with winged arrows.<br>Then the mighty Bhima deeply pierced by the Rakshasa, sat down on the<br>terrace of his car, overcome by a swoon. The son of the Wind-god then,<br>recovering his senses, became filled with rage. Drawing his excellent and<br>terrible bow that was capable of bearing a great strain, he afflicted<br>Alamvusha, in every part of his body, with keen shafts. Thereupon, the<br>Rakshasa who resembled a huge mass of antimony, looked resplendent O<br>king, like a flowering Kinsuka. Whilst being struck in that battle with<br>those shafts sped from the bow of Bhima, the Rakshasa recollected the<br>slaughter of his brother (Vaka) by the illustrious Pandava. Assuming then<br>an awful form, he addressed Bhima, saying, 'Wait a little in this battle,<br>O Partha! Behold today my prowess. O thou of wicked understanding, that<br>foremost of Rakshasas, viz., the mighty Vaka, was my brother. It is true<br>he was slain by thee. But that took place out of my sight.' Having said<br>these words unto Bhima, Alamvusha made himself invisible, and began to<br>cover Bhimasena with a dense shower of arrows. Upon the disappearance of<br>the Rakshasa, Bhima, O monarch, covered the welkin with straight shafts.<br>Thus afflicted by Bhima, Alamvusha soon returned to his car. And soon<br>again, he entered into the bowels of the earth and once more becoming<br>little he suddenly soared into the sky. Alamvusha, assumed countless<br>forms. Now becoming subtle and now huge and gross, he began to roar like<br>the clouds. And he uttered diverse kinds of words and speeches all<br>around. And from the welkin there fell thousands of arrowy torrents, as<br>also darts, and Kunapas, and lances, and spiked maces, and short arrows,<br>and scimitars, and swords, and thunders also. That awful downpour of<br>arrows caused by the Rakshasa, slew the troops of Pandu's son on the<br>field of battle. And in consequence of that arrowy downpour, many<br>elephants also of the Pandava army were slain, and many steeds also, O<br>king, and many foot-soldiers. And a river was caused there, whose waters<br>were blood and whose eddies were constituted by cars. And it abounded<br>with elephants that constituted its alligators. And the umbrellas of<br>car-warriors constituted its swans, and the flesh and marrow of animals,<br>its mire. And it teemed with the (cut off) arms of human beings that<br>constituted its snakes. And it was haunted by many Rakshasas and other<br>cannibals. And it wafted away, O king, countless Chedis and Panchalas and<br>Srinjayas. Beholding him, O monarch, careering so fearlessly in that<br>battle and seeing his prowess, the Pandavas became filled with anxiety;<br>and joy filled the hearts of thy troops then. And amongst the latter,<br>loud and terrible sounds of musical instruments, making the hair stand on<br>end, arose. Hearing that loud uproar made by thy troops, the son of Pandu<br>could not bear it, as a snake cannot bear the clap of human palms. With<br>eyes red as copper in rage, with glances that like fire consumed every<br>thing, the son of the Wind-god, like Tvashtri himself, aimed the weapon<br>known by the name of Tvashtri. From that weapon were produced thousands<br>of arrows on all sides. And in consequence of those arrows, a universal<br>rout was seen among thy troops.' That weapon, shot in battle by<br>Bhimasena, destroying the effective illusion produced by the Rakshasa,<br>greatly afflicted the Rakshasa himself. Struck in every part of his body<br>by Bhimasena, the Rakshasa, then abandoning Bhimasena, fled towards the<br>division of Drona. Upon the defeat of that prince of Rakshasa by the<br>high-souled Bhima, the Pandavas caused every point of the compass to<br>resound with their leonine roars. And filled with joy, they worshipped<br>the mighty son of Marut, like the Maruts worshipping Sakra after the<br>defeat in battle of Prahlada.'"
