                            "Dhritarashtra said, When such was the condition of battle, between those<br>heroes of their side and mine, what did Bhima then do? Tell me all, O<br>Sanjaya!'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'After Bhimasena had been made carless, that hero,<br>afflicted with the wordy darts of Karna and filled with rage, addressed<br>Phalguna and said, 'In thy very sight, O Dhananjaya, Karna hath<br>repeatedly said to me, 'Eunuch, fool, glutton, unskilled in weapons, do<br>not fight, child, unable to bear the burden of battle!' He that would<br>tell me so would be slain by me. Karna hath told me those words, O<br>Bharata! O mighty-armed one, thou knowest the vow which I have made<br>jointly with thee. Remember the words that were then spoken by me. O<br>foremost of men, act in such a way that that vow of mine, O son of Kunti,<br>as also thy own vow, may not be falsified. O Dhananjaya, do that by which<br>that vow of mine may be made true.' Hearing these words of Bhima, Arjuna<br>of immeasurable prowess, getting near Karna in that battle, told him, 'O<br>Karna, thou art of false fight. O son of a Suta, thou applaudest thy own<br>self. Of wicked understanding, listen now to what I tell thee. Heroes<br>meet with either of these two things in battle, viz., victory or defeat.<br>Both of these are uncertain, O son of Radha! The case is not otherwise<br>when Indra himself is engaged in battle. Made carless by Yuyudhana, with<br>thy senses no longer under thy control, thou wert almost at the point of<br>death. Remembering, however, that I had vowed to slay thee, that hero<br>dismissed thee without taking thy life. It is true thou hadst succeeded<br>in depriving Bhimasena of his car. Thy abuse, however, O son of Radha, of<br>that hero was sinful. Those bulls among men that are truly righteous and<br>brave, having vanquished a foe, never boast, nor speak ill of anybody.<br>Thy knowledge, however, is little. It is for this, O son of a Suta, that<br>thou indulged in such speeches. Then, again the abusive epithets thou<br>didst apply to the battling Bhimasena, endued with great prowess and<br>heroism and devoted to the practices of the righteous, were not<br>consistent with truth. In the very sight of all the troops, of Kesava, as<br>also of myself, thou wert many a time made carless by Bhimasena in<br>battle. That son of Pandu, however, did not call thee a single harsh<br>word. Since, however, thou hast addressed Vrikodara in many harsh<br>speeches, and since thou with others hast slain the son of Subhadra out<br>of my sight, therefore, this very day obtain the fruit of those offences<br>of thine. It was for thy own destruction, O wicked wight, that thou didst<br>then cut off Abhimanyu's bow; for that, O thou of little understanding,<br>thou shalt be slain by me, with all thy followers, forces, and animals.<br>Accomplish now all those acts which thou shouldst do, for a great<br>calamity is impending over thee. I will slay Vrishasena in thy very sight<br>in battle. All those other kings, again, that will fully advance against<br>me, I will despatch unto Yama's abode. I say this truly, laying my hand<br>on my weapon. A fool as thou art, without wisdom and full of vanity, I<br>say that beholding thee lying on the field of battle the wicked<br>Duryodhana will indulge in bitter lamentations.' After Arjuna had vowed<br>the slaughter of Karna's son, a loud and tremendous uproar arose amongst<br>the car-warriors. At that frightful time when confusion was everywhere,<br>the thousand-rayed sun, dimming his rays, entered the Asta hill. Then, O<br>king, Hrishikesa, stationed in the van of battle embracing Arjuna who had<br>accomplished his vow, told him these words, By good luck, O Jishnu, thy<br>great vow hath been accomplished. By good luck, that Vriddhakshatra hath<br>been slain along with his son. The celestial generalissimo himself, O<br>-Bharata, encountering the Dhartarashtra force, would, in battle, O<br>Jishnu, lose his senses. There is no doubt of this. Except thee, O tiger<br>among men, I do not even in thought see the person in the three worlds<br>that could fight with this host. Many royal warriors endued with great<br>prowess, equal to thee or superior have been united together at<br>Duryodhana's command. Clad in mail, they could not approach thee,<br>encountering thy angry self in battle. Thy energy and might are equal to<br>that of Rudra or the Destroyer himself. None else is capable of putting<br>forth such prowess in battle as thou, O scorcher of foes, alone and<br>unsupported, didst today put forth. Thus shall I applaud thee again after<br>Karna of wicked soul has been slain along with his followers. Thus shall<br>I glorify thee when that foe of thine shall have been vanquished and<br>slain.' Unto him Arjuna replied, 'Through thy grace, O Madhava, this vow<br>that even the gods could with difficulty accomplish, hath been<br>accomplished by me. Their victory is not at all a matter of wonder that<br>have thee, O Kesava, for their lord. Through thy grace, Yudhishthira will<br>obtain the whole earth. All this is due to thy power, O thou of Vrishni's<br>race! This is thy victory, O lord! Our prosperity is thy victory, O lord!<br>Our prosperity is thy care and we are thy servants, O slayer of Madhu!'<br>Thus addressed, Krishna smiled softly, and slowly urged the steeds. And<br>he showed unto Partha, as they came, the field of battle abounding with<br>cruel sights.<br><br>"Then Krishna said, 'Desirous of victory in battle or world-wide fame<br>many heroic kings are lying on the earth, struck with thy shafts. Their<br>weapons and ornaments lay scattered, and their steeds, cars, and<br>elephants are mangled and broken. With their coats of mail pierced or cut<br>open, they have come to the greatest grief. Some of them are yet alive,<br>and some of them are dead. Those, however, that are dead, still seem to<br>be alive in consequence of the splendour with which they are endued.<br>Behold the earth covered with their shafts equipped with golden wings,<br>with their numerous other weapons of attack and defence, and with their<br>animals (deprived of life). Indeed, the earth looks resplendent with<br>coats of mail and necklaces of gems, with their heads decked with<br>earrings, and headgears and diadems, and floral wreaths and jewels worn<br>on crowns, and Kanthasutras and Angadas, and collars of gold, and with<br>diverse other beautiful ornaments. Strewn with Anuskaras and quivers,<br>with standards and banners, with Upaskaras and Adhishthanas, with shafts<br>and crests of cars, with broken wheels and beautiful Akshas in profusion,<br>with yokes and trappings of steeds, with belts and bows and arrows, with<br>elephants, housings, with spiked maces and hooks of iron, with darts and<br>short arrows, with spears and pikes, with Kundas and clubs, with<br>Sataghnis and Bhushandis, with scimitars and axes, with short and heavy<br>clubs and mallets, with maces and Kunapas, with whips decked with gold, O<br>bull of Bharata's race, with the bells and diverse other ornaments of<br>mighty elephants, with floral garlands and various kinds of decorations,<br>and with costly robes all loosened from the bodies of men and animals,<br>the earth shines brilliantly, like the autumnal firmament with planets<br>and stars. The lords of the earth, slain for the sake of earth, are<br>slumbering on the earth clasping with their limbs the earth like a dear<br>wife. Like mountains shedding through their caves and fissures streams of<br>liquid chalk, these elephants, resembling Airavata himself and huge as<br>mountains, are shedding profuse streams of blood through the openings in<br>their bodies caused by weapons. Behold, O hero, those huge creatures<br>afflicted with shafts lying on the ground in convulsions. Behold, those<br>steeds also, lying on the ground, adorned with trappings of gold. Behold<br>also, O Partha, those riderless and driverless cars that had at one time<br>resembled celestial vehicles or the vapoury forms in the evening sky, now<br>lying on the ground, with standards and banners and Akshas and yokes cut<br>into pieces, and with broken shafts and crests, O lord. Foot-soldiers<br>also, O hero, bearing bows and shields and slain in hundreds and<br>thousands are lying on the ground, bathed in blood and clasping the earth<br>with every limb and their locks smeared with dust. Behold, O mighty-armed<br>one, those warriors with bodies mangled with thy weapons. Behold the<br>earth, strewn with Yak-tails and fans, and umbrellas and standards, and<br>steeds and cars and elephants, and with diverse kinds of blankets, and<br>reins of steeds, and beautiful robes and costly Varuthas (of cars), look,<br>as if overspread with embroidered tapestry. Many warriors fallen from the<br>backs of well-equipped elephants along with those creatures themselves<br>that they had ridden, are looking like lions fallen from mountain summits<br>struck down by thunder. Mingled with the steeds (they had ridden) and the<br>bows (they had held), horsemen and foot-soldiers in large numbers, are<br>lying on the field, covered with blood. Behold, O foremost of men, the<br>surface of the earth is frightful to look at, covered as it is with large<br>number of slain elephants and steeds and car-warriors, and miry with<br>blood, fat, and rotten flesh in profusion, and on which dogs and wolves<br>and Pisachas and diverse wanderers of the night are cantering with joy!<br>This fame-enhancing and mighty feat on the field of battle is capable of<br>being achieved by thee only, O puissant one, or by that chief of the<br>gods, viz., Indra himself, who in great battle slayeth the Daityas and<br>the Danavas.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, "Thus showing the field of battle unto the<br>diadem-decked Arjuna, Krishna blew his conch Panchajanya with the gleeful<br>soldiers of the Pandava army (blowing their respective conchs). Having<br>shown the field of battle unto the diadem-decked hero, that slayer of<br>foes viz., Janardana quickly proceeded towards Ajatasatru, the son of<br>Pandu, and informed him of the slaying of Jayadratha.'"[177]
