                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Day by day, O Sanjaya, my blazing fame is being<br>darkened. A great many warriors of mine have fallen. I think, all this is<br>due to the reverse brought about by time. Dhananjaya, excited with rage,<br>hath penetrated into my host which is protected by Drona's son, and Karna<br>and which, therefore, is incapable of being penetrated by the very gods.<br>United with those two of blazing energy viz., Krishna and Bhima, as also<br>with that bull among the Sinis, his prowess hath been increased. Since I<br>have heard of Dhananjaya's entry, grief is consuming my heart, like fire<br>consuming a heap of dry grass, I see that all the kings of the earth with<br>the ruler of the Sindhus amongst them, are affected by evil destiny.<br>Having done a great wrong to the diadem-decked (Arjuna), how can the<br>ruler of the Sindhus, if he falls within Arjuna's sight, save his life?<br>From circumstantial inference, I see, O Sanjaya, how can the ruler of the<br>Sindhus, if he falls within Arjuna's sight, save his life? From<br>circumstantial inference, I see, O Sanjaya, that the ruler of the Sindhus<br>is already dead. Tell me, however, truly how the battle raged. Thou art<br>skilled in narration, O Sanjaya, tell me truly how the Vrishni hero<br>Satyaki fought, who striving resolutely for Dhananjaya's sake, alone<br>entered in rage the vast force, disturbing and agitating it repeatedly,<br>like an elephant plunging into a lake overgrown with lotuses.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding that foremost of men, viz., Bhima, to proceed,<br>afflicted with Karna's shafts in the midst, O king, or many heroes, that<br>foremost warrior amongst the Sinis followed him on his car. Roaring like<br>the clouds at the close of summer, and blazing like the autumnal sun, he<br>began to slaughter with his formidable bow the host of thy son, causing<br>it to tremble repeatedly. And as the foremost one of Madhu's race, O<br>Bharata, thus proceeded along the field on his car, drawn by steeds of<br>the hue of silver and himself roaring terribly, none amongst thy warriors<br>could check his progress. Then that foremost of kings, viz., Alamvusha,<br>full of rage, never retreating from battle, armed with bow, and clad in a<br>golden coat of mail rushing quickly, impeded the progress of Satyaki,<br>that foremost warrior of Madhu's race. The encounter, then, O Bharata,<br>that took place between them was such that its like had never been. All<br>thy warriors and the enemy, abstaining from the fight, became spectators<br>of that engagement between those two ornaments of battle. Then that<br>foremost of kings, viz., Alamvusha forcibly pierced Satyaki with ten<br>arrows. That bull of Sini's race, however, with shafts, cut all those<br>arrows before they could reach him. And once more, Alamvusha struck<br>Satyaki with three sharp arrows equipped with beautiful wings, blazing as<br>fire, and shot from his bow drawn to the ear. Those piercing through<br>Satyaki's coat of mail, penetrated into his body. Having pierced<br>Satyaki's body with those sharp and blazing arrows, endued with the force<br>of fire or the wind, Alamvusha forcibly struck the four steeds of<br>Satyaki, white as silver, with four other arrows. The grandson of Sini,<br>endued with great activity and prowess like that of (Kesava himself), the<br>bearer of the discus, thus struck by him, slew with four shafts of great<br>impetuosity the four steeds of Alamvusha. Having then cut off the head,<br>beautiful as the full moon and decked with excellent car-rings with a<br>broad-headed arrow, fierce as the Yuga-fire. Having slain that descendant<br>of many kings in battle, that bull among the Yadus, that hero capable of<br>grinding hostile hosts, proceeded towards Arjuna, O king, resisting, as<br>he went, the enemy's troops. Indeed, O king, thus careering in the midst<br>of the foe, the Vrishni hero, while proceeding in the wake (of Arjuna),<br>was seen repeatedly to destroy with his shafts the Kuru host, like the<br>hurricane dispersing gathering masses of clouds. Whithersoever that lion<br>among men desired to go, thither he was borne by those excellent steeds<br>of his, of the Sindhu breed, well-broken, docile, white as milk of the<br>Kunda flower or the moon or snow, and adorned with trappings of warriors,<br>viz., Duhsasana,&#8212;their commander. Those leaders of divisions,<br>encompassing the grandson of Sini on all sides in that battle, began to<br>strike him. That foremost one among the Satwatas, that hero, viz.,<br>Satyaki also, resisted them all with showers of arrows. Quickly checking<br>all of them by means of his fiery shafts, that slayer of foes, viz., the<br>grandson of Sini, forcibly uplifting his bow, O Ajamida, slew the steeds<br>of Duhsasana. Then, Arjuna and Krishna, beholding that foremost of men,<br>(viz., Satyaki) in that battle, became filled with joy."'
