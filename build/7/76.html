                            "Arjuna said, 'These six car-warriors of the Dhritarashtra army whom thou<br>regardest to be so strong their (united) energy, I think is not equal to<br>even half of mine! Thou shalt see, O slayer of Madhu, the weapons of all<br>these cut off and baffled by me when I go against them for slaying<br>Jayadratha! In the very sight of Drona and all his men, I will fell the<br>head of the ruler of the Sindhus, on the earth, beholding which they will<br>indulge in lamentations. If the Siddhas, the Rudras, the Vasus, with the<br>Aswins, the Maruts with Indra: (at their head) the Viswadevas with other<br>gods, the Pitris, the Gandharvas, Garuda, the Ocean, the mountains, the<br>firmament, Heaven, Earth, the point of the compass (cardinal and<br>subsidiary), and the regents of those points, all the creatures that are<br>domestic and all that are wild, in fact if all the mobile and the<br>immobile beings together, become the protectors of the ruler of the<br>Sindhus, yet, O slayer of Madhu, shalt thou behold Jayadratha slain by me<br>tomorrow in battle with my arrows! O Krishna, I swear by Truth, I touch<br>my weapons (and swear by them), that I shall, O Kesava, at the very<br>outset, encounter that Drona, that mighty bowman, who hath become the<br>protector of that sinful wretch Jayadratha! Suyodhana thinks that this<br>game (of battle) resteth on Drona! Therefore, piercing through the very<br>van commanded by Drona himself, I shall get at Jayadratha! Thou shalt<br>tomorrow behold the mightiest of bowmen riven by me in battle by means of<br>my shafts endued with fierce energy, like summits of a hill riven by the<br>thunder, Blood shall flow (in torrents) from the breasts of fallen men<br>and elephants and steeds, split open by whetted shafts failing fast upon<br>them! The shafts shot from Gandiva, fleet as the mind or the wind, will<br>deprive thousands of men and elephants and steeds of life! Men will<br>behold in tomorrow's battle those weapons which I have obtained from Yama<br>and Kaurva and Varuna and Indra and Rudra! Thou shalt behold in<br>tomorrow's battle the weapons of all those who come to protect the ruler<br>of the Sindhus, baffled by me with my Brahma weapon! Thou shalt in<br>tomorrow's battle, O Kesava, behold the earth strewn by me with the heads<br>of kings cut off by the force, of my shafts! (Tomorrow) I shall gratify<br>all cannibals, rout the foe, gladden my friends, and crush the ruler of<br>the Sindhus! A great offender, one who hath not acted like a relative,<br>born in a sinful country, the ruler of the Sindhu, slain by me, will<br>sadden his own. Thou shalt behold that ruler of the Sindhus, of sinful<br>behaviour, and brought up in every luxury, pierced by me with my shafts!<br>On the morrow, O Krishana, I shall do that which shall make Suyodhana<br>think that there is no other bowman in the world who is equal to me! My<br>Gandiva is a celestial bow! I myself am the warrior. O bull among men!<br>Thou, O Hrishikesa, art the charioteer! What is that I will not be able<br>to vanquish? Through thy grace, O holy one, what is there unattainable by<br>me in battle? Knowing my prowess to be incapable of being resisted, why,<br>O Hrishikesa, dost thou, yet rebuke me? As Lakshmi is ever present in<br>Soma, as water is ever present in the Ocean, know this, O Janarddana,<br>that even so is my vow ever accomplished! Do not think lightly of my<br>weapons! Do not think lightly of my tough bow! Do not think lightly of<br>the might of my arms! Do not think lightly of Dhananjaya! I shall go to<br>battle in such a way that I shall truly win and not lose! When I have<br>vowed it, know that Jayadratha hath already been slain in battle! Verily,<br>in the Brahmana is truth; verily, in the righteous is humility; verily,<br>in sacrifice is prosperity; verily, in Narayana is victory!<br><br>"Sanjaya continued,&#8212;'Having said these words unto Hrishikesa, the son of<br>Vasudeva, having himself said so unto his own self, Arjuna in a deep<br>voice, once more addressed lord Kesava, saying&#8212;Thou shouldst O Krishna,<br>so act that my car may be well equipt as soon as this night dawns, since<br>grave is the task that is at hand!'"
