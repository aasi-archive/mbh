                            "Sanjaya said, 'The troops of both the armies, having proceeded to their<br>tents, duly took up their quarters, O king, according to the divisions<br>and the sub-divisions to which they belonged. Having withdrawn the<br>troops, Drona, in great cheerlessness of mind, beholding Duryodhana, said<br>these words in shame: 'I told thee before that when Dhananjaya is by<br>Yudhishthira, he is incapable of being seized in battle by the very gods.<br>Although all of you fell upon him in battle, yet Partha frustrated all<br>your attempts. Do not doubt what I say, Krishna and Pandu's son (Arjuna)<br>are invincible. If, however, Arjuna of white steeds can, by any means, be<br>withdrawn (from Yudhishthira's side), then Yudhishthira, O king, shall<br>soon come under thy control. Let some one challenging him (Arjuna) in<br>battle draw him away to some other part of the field. The son of Kunti<br>will not return without vanquishing him. Meanwhile, when Arjuna will not<br>be by, O monarch, I will seize king Yudhishthira the just, penetrating<br>through the Pandava host in the very sight of Dhrishtadyumna. Thus, O<br>monarch, I will, without doubt, bring Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma,<br>along with his followers, under control. If that son of Pandu stays even<br>for a moment before me in battle, I will bring him a captive from the<br>field. That feat will be more advantageous than victory (over the Pandava<br>army).'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing those words of Drona, the ruler of the<br>Trigartas, O monarch, with his brothers, said these words: 'We, O king,<br>are always humiliated by the wielder of Gandiva! O bull of Bharata's<br>race, although we have done him no injury, yet he hath always injured us.<br>Remembering all those diverse instances of humiliation, we burn in wrath<br>and are never able to sleep at night. By good luck, that Arjuna, armed<br>with weapons, will stand before us. That therefore, which is in our heart<br>and which we strive to accomplish, we are resolved to achieve now, that<br>viz., which will be agreeable to thee, and which will bring us renown.<br>Taking him out of the field will slay him. Let the earth today be without<br>Arjuna or let it be without the Trigartas. We truly swear this before<br>thee. This our vow will never be false.' And Satyaratha and Satyavarman,<br>O Bharata, and Satyavrata and Satyeshu, and Satyakarman also, having<br>spoken similarly, those five brothers together, with ten thousand cars,<br>came, O king, (before Duryodhana), having taken that oath on the field of<br>battle. And the Malavas, and the Tundikeras with thousand cars, and the<br>tiger among men, Susarman, the ruler of Prasthala, with the Mavellakas,<br>the Lalithas, and the Madrakas, accompanied by ten thousand cars and his<br>brothers, and with another ten thousand cars from diverse realms came<br>forward for taking the oath. Then bringing fire, and each making<br>preparations for igniting one for himself, they took up ropes Kusa grass<br>and beautiful coats of mail. And equipped in mail, bathed in clarified<br>butter, clad in robes of Kusa grass, and with their bow-strings serving<br>as girdles, those heroes, who had given away hundreds and thousands as<br>presents to Brahmanas, who had performed many sacrifices, had been<br>blessed with children, and were deserving of blessed regions hereafter,<br>who had nothing more to do in this world, who were deserving of blessed<br>regions hereafter, who were prepared to lay down their lives in battle,<br>and who devoted their souls to the attainment of fame and victory, who<br>were desirous of soon repairing by fair fight to those regions<br>(hereafter) that are attainable by means only of sacrifices, with<br>abundant presents to Brahmanas, and by means also of the rites, the chief<br>amongst which are Brahmacharya and study of the Vedas, those heroes,<br>having each gratified Brahmanas by giving them gold,[30] and kine, and<br>robes, and having addressed one another in loving discourse, ignited<br>those fires and took that vow in battle. And in the presence of those<br>fires, firmly resolved, they took that vow. And having made that vow for<br>the slaughter of Dhananjaya, they, in the hearing of creatures, very<br>loudly said, Those regions that are for persons who have never adopted<br>any vows, are for one who drinketh wine, those that are for him who hath<br>adulterous connection with his preceptor's wife, those that are for him<br>who robbeth the property of a Brahmana, or for him who enjoyeth the<br>king's grant without satisfying the condition of that grant or for him<br>who abandoneth one asking for shelter, or for him who slayeth a candidate<br>for his favour, those that are for persons that set fire to houses and<br>for those that slay kine, those regions that are for those that injure<br>others, those that are for persons harbouring malice against Brahmanas,<br>those that are for him who from folly doth not seek the companionship of<br>his wife in her season, those also that are for those that seek the<br>companionship of women on the day they have to perform the Sraddha of<br>their ancestors, those that are for persons that injure their own selves,<br>or for those that misappropriate what is deposited with them from<br>confidence or for those that destroy learning, or for those who battle<br>with eunuchs, or for those that follow persons that are mean those<br>regions that are for atheists, or for those that abandon their (sacred)<br>fires and mothers, and those regions also that are for the sinful, those<br>shall be ours, if without slaying Dhananjaya we return from the field, or<br>if, ground by him on the field, we turn back from fear. If, again, we<br>succeed in achieving in battle feats the most difficult of accomplishment<br>in the world, we shalt then, without doubt, obtain the most desirable<br>regions. Having said these words, O king, those heroes then marched to<br>battle, summoning Arjuna towards the southern part of the field. That<br>tiger among men, and subjugator of hostile cities, Arjuna, thus<br>challenged by them, said these words unto king Yudhishthira the Just<br>without any delay: 'Summoned, I never turn back. This is my fixed vow.<br>These men, sworn to conquer or die, are summoning me, O king, to great<br>battle. This Susarman here, with his brothers, summoneth me to battle. It<br>behoveth thee to grant me permission for slaying him, with all his<br>followers. O bull among men, I am unable to brook this challenge. I tell<br>thee truly, know these foes to be (already) slain in battle.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast heard, O child, in detail, what Drona hath<br>resolved to accomplish. Act thou in such a way that that resolve of his<br>may become futile. Drona is endued with great might. He is a hero,<br>accomplished in arms, and above fatigue. O mighty car-warrior, even he<br>hath vowed my seizure.'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'This Satyajit, O king, will today become thy protector in<br>battle. As long as Satyajit lives, the preceptor will never be able to<br>attain his desire. If, however, O lord, this tiger among men, Satyajit,<br>be slain in battle, thou shouldst not then remain on the field even if<br>surrounded by all our warriors.'<br><br>"'Sanjaya continued, 'King Yudhishthira then gave (Arjuna) the leave (he<br>sought). And he also embraced Arjuna and eyed him affectionately. And<br>diverse were the benedictions that the king uttered on him. Having made<br>this arrangement (for Yudhishthira's protection),[31] the mighty Partha<br>went out against the Trigartas, like a hungry lion, for assuaging his<br>hunger upon a herd of deer. Then Duryodhana's troops, filled with joy at<br>Arjuna's absence (from Yudhishthira's side), became furious for the<br>seizure of Yudhishthira. Then both the hosts, with a great impetuosity,<br>encountered each other, like the Ganga and the Sarayu in the season of<br>rains when both streams are swollen with water.'"
