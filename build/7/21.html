                            "Sanjaya continued, 'Then Drona, beholding Yudhishthira near him<br>fearlessly received him with a thick shower of arrows. And there arose a<br>loud noise among the troops of Yudhishthira's army like what is made by<br>the elephants belonging to a herd when their leader is attacked by a<br>mighty lion. Beholding Drona, the brave Satyajit, of prowess incapable of<br>being baffled, rushed at the Preceptor who was desirous of seizing<br>Yudhishthira. The Preceptor and the Panchala prince, both endued with<br>great might, fought with each other, agitating each other's troops, like<br>Indra and Vali. Then Satyajit, of prowess incapable of being baffled,<br>invoking a mighty weapon, pierced Drona with keen-pointed arrows. And<br>Satyajit shot at Drona's charioteer five arrows, fatal as snake-poison<br>and each looking like Death himself. The charioteer, thus struck, became<br>deprived of his senses. Then Satyajit quickly Pierced Drona's steeds with<br>ten shafts; and filled with rage, he next pierced each of his Parshni<br>drivers with ten shafts. And then he coursed at the head of his troops on<br>his car in a circular motion. Excited with wrath, he cut off the standard<br>of Drona, that crushers of foes Drona then, that chastiser of foes,<br>beholding these feats of his foe in battle, mentally resolved to despatch<br>him to the other world.[37] The Preceptor, cutting off Satyajit's bow<br>with arrow fixed thereon, quickly pierced him with ten arrows capable of<br>penetrating into the very vitals. Thereupon, the valiant Satyajit,<br>quickly taking up another bow, struck Drona, O king, with thirty arrows<br>winged with the feathers of the Kanka bird. Beholding Drona (thus)<br>encountered in battle by Satyajit, the Pandayas, O king, shouted in joy<br>and waved their garments. Then the mighty Vrika, O king, excited with<br>great wrath, pierced Drona in the centre of the chest with sixty arrows.<br>That feat seemed highly wonderful., Then that mighty car-warrior, viz.,<br>Drona, of great impetuosity, covered with the arrowy showers (of his<br>foes) opened his eyes wide and mustered all his energy. Then cutting off<br>the bows of both Satyajit and Vrika, Drona, with six shafts slew Vrika<br>with his charioteer and steeds. Then Satyajit, taking up another bow that<br>was tougher, pierced Drona with his steeds, his charioteer, and his<br>standard. Thus afflicted in battle by the prince of the Panchalas, Drona<br>could not brook that act. For the destruction then of his foe, he quickly<br>shot his arrows (at him). Drona then covered with incessant showers of<br>arrows his antagonist's steeds and standards as also the handle of his<br>bow, and both his Parshni drivers. But though his bows were (thus)<br>repeatedly cut off, the prince of the Panchalas conversant with the<br>highest weapons continued to battle with him of red steeds. Beholding<br>Satyajit swell with energy in that dreadful combat, Drona cut off that<br>illustrious warrior's head with a crescent-shaped arrow.[38] Upon the<br>slaughter of that foremost of combatants, that mighty car-warrior among<br>the Panchalas, Yudhishthira, from fear of Drona, fled away, (borne) by<br>fleet steeds. Then the Panchalas, the Kekayas, the Matsyas, the Chedis,<br>the Karushas and the Kosalas, seeing Drona, rushed at him, desirous of<br>rescuing Yudhishthira. The Preceptor, however, that slayer of large<br>numbers of foes, desirous of seizing Yudhishthira, began to consume those<br>divisions, like fire consuming heaps of cotton. Then Satanika, the<br>younger brother of the ruler of the Matsyas, rushed at Drona who was thus<br>engaged in incessantly destroying those divisions (of the Pandava host).<br>And Satanika, piercing Drona along with his driver and steeds with six<br>shafts, bright as the rays of the sun and polished by his hands of their<br>forger, uttered loud shouts. And engaged in a cruel act, and endeavouring<br>to accomplish what was difficult of attainment, he covered Bharadwaja's<br>son, that mighty car-warrior with showers of arrows.[39] Then Drona, with<br>an arrow sharp as razor, quickly cut off from his trunk the head, decked<br>with ear-rings of Satanika, shouting at him. Thereupon, the Matsya<br>warriors all fled away. Having vanquished the Matsyas, the son of<br>Bharadwaja then defeated the Chedis, the Karushas, the Kaikeyas, the<br>Panchalas, the Srinjayas. and the Pandus repeatedly. Beholding that hero<br>of the golden car, excited with rage and consuming their divisions, like<br>a fire consuming a forest, the Srinjayas trembled (with fear). Endued<br>with great activity and slaughtering the foe ceaselessly, the twang of<br>the bow-string, as he stretched his bow, was heard in all directions.<br>Fierce arrows shot by that warrior endued with great lightness of hand,<br>crushed elephants and steeds and foot-soldiers and car-warriors and<br>elephant-riders. As a mighty mass of roaring clouds in summer with<br>violent winds (blowing) poureth a shower of hail-stones, so did Drona<br>pour his arrowy showers and inspired fear in the hearts of his foes. That<br>mighty hero, that great bowman, that dispeller of the fears of his<br>friends, careered in all directions (of the field) agitating the<br>(hostile) host. The bow, decked with gold, of Drona of immeasurable<br>energy, was seen in all directions like the flashes of lightning in the<br>clouds. The beautiful altar on his banner, as he careered in battle, O<br>Bharata, was seen to resemble a crest or Himavat. The slaughter that<br>Drona caused among the Pandava troops was very great, resembling that<br>caused by Vishnu himself, the adored of both the gods and Asuras, among<br>the Daitya host. Heroic, truthful in speech, endued with great wisdom and<br>might, and possessed of prowess incapable of being baffled, the<br>illustrious Drona caused a river to flow there that was fierce and<br>capable of striking the timid with fear. Coats of mail formed its waves,<br>and standards its eddies. And it carried away (as it ran) large numbers<br>of mortal creatures. And elephants and steeds constituted its great<br>alligators, and swords formed its fishes. And it was incapable of being<br>easily crossed over. The bones of brave warriors formed its pebbles, and<br>drums and cymbals its tortoises. And shields and armour formed its boats,<br>and the hair of warriors its floating moss and weeds. And arrows<br>constituted its wavelets and bows its current. And the arms of the<br>combatants formed its snakes.[40] And that river of fierce current,<br>running over the field of battle, bore away both the Kurus and the<br>Srinjayas. And the heads of human beings, constituted its stones, and<br>their thighs its fishes. And maces constituted the rafts (by which many<br>sought to cross it). And head-gears formed the forth that covered its<br>surface, and the entrails (of animals) its reptiles. Awful (in mien), it<br>bore away heroes (to the other world). And blood and flesh constituted<br>its mire. And elephants formed its crocodiles, and standards, the trees<br>(on its banks). Thousands of Kshatriyas sank in it. Fierce, clogged<br>(dead) bodies, and having horse-soldiers and elephant-warriors for its<br>sharks, it was extremely difficult to cross it. And that river ran<br>towards the abode of Yama. And it abounded with Rakshasas and dogs and<br>jackals. And it v as haunted by fierce cannibals all around.<br><br>"Then many Pandava warriors, headed by Kunti's son, rushing at Drona,<br>that mighty car-warrior consuming their divisions like Death himself,<br>surrounded him on all sides. Indeed, those brave warriors completely<br>encompassed Drona who was scorching everything around him like the sun<br>himself scorching the world with his rays. Then the kings and the princes<br>of thy army, with upraised weapons, all rushed for supporting that hero<br>and great bowman. Then Sikhandin pierced Drona with five straight arrows.<br>And Kshatradharman pierced him with twenty arrows, and Vasudeva with<br>five. And Uttamaujas pierced him with three arrows, and Kshatradeva with<br>five. And Satyaki pierced him in that battle with a hundred arrows, and<br>Yudhamanyu with eight. And Yudhishthira pierced Drona with a dozen<br>shafts, and Dhrishtadyumna pierced him with ten, and Chekitana with<br>three. Then Drona, of unbaffled aim and resembling an elephant with rent<br>temples, getting over the car-division (of the Pandavas), overthrew<br>Dridhasena. Approaching then king Kshema who was battling fearlessly, he<br>struck him with nine arrows. Thereupon, Kshema, deprived of life, fell<br>down from his car. Getting then into the midst of the (hostile) troops,<br>he careered in all directions, protecting others, but himself in no need<br>of Protection. He then pierced Sikhandin with twelve arrows, and<br>Uttamaujas with twenty. And he despatched Vasudeva with a broad-headed<br>arrow to the abode of Yama. And he pierced Kshemavarman with eighty<br>arrows, and Sudakshina with six and twenty. And he felled Kshatradeva<br>with a broad-headed arrow from his niche in the car. And having pierced<br>Yudhamanyu with sixty-four arrows and Satyaki with thirty, Drona, of the<br>golden car, quickly approached Yudhishthira. Then Yudhishthira, that best<br>of kings, quickly fled away from the preceptor, borne by his fleet<br>steeds. Then Panchala rushed at Drona. Drona slew the prince, cutting off<br>his bow, and felling his steeds and charioteer along with him. Deprived<br>of life, the prince fell down on the earth from his car, like a luminary<br>loosened from the firmament. Upon the fall of that illustrious prince of<br>the Panchalas, loud cries were heard thereof, 'Slay Drona, Slay Drona!'<br>The mighty Drona then began to crush and mangle the Panchalas, the<br>Matsyas, the Kaikeyas, the Srinjayas, and the Pandavas, all excited with<br>rage. And supported by the Kurus, Drona, then vanquished Satyaki and<br>Chekitana's son, and Senavindu, and Suvarchas, all these and numerous<br>other kings. Thy warriors, O king, having obtained the victory in that<br>great battle, slew the Pandavas as they flew away in all directions. And<br>the Panchalas, the Kaikeyas and the Matsyas, thus slaughtered on all<br>sides like the Danavas by Indra, began to tremble (with fear).'"
