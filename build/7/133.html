                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then the carless Karna, thus once more completely<br>defeated by Bhima, mounted another car and speedily began to pierce the<br>son of Pandu. Like two huge elephants encountering each other with the<br>points of their tusks, they struck each other with shafts, shot from<br>their bows drawn to the fullest stretch. Then Karna, striking Bhimasena<br>with showers of shafts, uttered a loud roar, and once more pierced him in<br>the chest. Bhima, however, in return, pierced Karna with ten straight<br>arrows and once more with twenty straight arrows. Then Karna, piercing<br>Bhima, O king, with nine arrows in the centre of the chest, struck the<br>latter's standard with a sharp shaft. The son of Pritha then pierced<br>Karna in return with three and sixty arrows, like a driver striking a<br>mighty elephant with the hook, or a rider striking a steed with a whip.<br>Deeply pierced, O king, by the illustrious son of Pandu, the heroic Karna<br>began to lick with his tongue the corners of his mouth, and his eyes<br>became red in rage. Then, O monarch, Karna, sped at Bhimasena, for his<br>destruction, a shaft capable of piercing everybody, like Indra hurling<br>his thunderbolt. That shaft equipped with beautiful feathers sped from<br>the bow of the Suta's son, piercing Partha in that battle, sank deep into<br>the earth. Then the mighty-armed Bhima, with eyes red in wrath, hurled<br>without a moment's reflection, at the Suta's son, a heavy six-sided mace,<br>adorned with gold measuring full four cubits in length, and resembling<br>the bolt of Indra in force. Indeed, like Indra slaying the Asuras with<br>his thunderbolt, that hero of Bharata's race, excited with wrath, slew<br>with that mace the well-trained steeds of the foremost breed, of<br>Adhiratha's son. Then, O bull of Bharata's race, the mighty-armed Bhima,<br>with a couple of razor-faced arrows, cut off the standard of Karna. And<br>then he slew, with a number of shafts his enemy's charioteer. Abandoning<br>that steedless and driverless and standardless car, Karna. O Bharata,<br>cheerlessly stood on the earth, drawing his bow. The prowess that we then<br>beheld of Radha's son was extremely wonderful, inasmuch as that foremost<br>of car-warriors, though deprived of car, continued to resist his foe.<br>Beholding that foremost of men, viz., the son of Adhiratha, deprived of<br>his car, Duryodhana, O monarch, said unto (his brother) Durmukha, 'There,<br>O Durmukha, the son of Radha hath been deprived of his car by Bhimasena.<br>Furnish that foremost of men, that mighty car-warrior with a car.'<br>Hearing these words of Duryodhana, thy son Durmukha, O Bharata, quickly<br>proceeded towards Karna and covered Bhima with his shafts. Beholding<br>Durmukha desirous of supporting the Suta's son in that battle, the son of<br>the Wind god was filled with delight and began to lick the corners of his<br>mouth. Then resisting Karna the while with his shafts, the son of Pandu<br>quickly drove his car towards Durmukha. And in that moment, O king, with<br>nine straight arrows of keen points, Bhima despatched Durmukha to Yama's<br>abode, Upon Durmukha's slaughter, the son of Adhiratha mounted upon the<br>car of that prince and looked resplendent, O king, like the blazing sun.<br>Beholding Durmukha lying prostrate on the field, his very vital pierced<br>(with shafts) and his body bathed in blood, Karna with tearful eyes<br>abstained for a moment from the fight. Circumambulating the fallen prince<br>and leaving him there, the heroic Karna began to breathe long and hot<br>breaths and knew not what to do. Seizing that opportunity, O king,<br>Bhimasena shot at the Suta's son four and ten long shafts equipped with<br>vulturine feathers. Those blood-drinking shafts of golden wings, endued<br>with great force illuminating the ten points as they coursed through the<br>welkin, pierced the armour of the Suta's son, and drank his life-blood, O<br>king, and passing through his body, sank into the earth and looked<br>resplendent like angry snakes, O monarch, urged on by Death himself, with<br>half their bodies inserted within their holes. Then the son of Radha,<br>without reflecting a moment, pierced Bhima in return with four and ten<br>fierce shafts adorned with gold. Those fierce-winged arrows, piercing<br>through Bhima's right arms, entered the earth like birds entering a grove<br>of trees. Striking against the earth, those arrows looked resplendent,<br>like the blazing rays of the sun while proceeding towards the Asta hills.<br>Pierced in that battle with those all-piercing arrows, Bhima began to<br>shed copious streams of blood, like a mountain ejecting streams of water.<br>Then Bhima pierced the Suta's son in return with three shafts endued with<br>the impetuosity of Garuda and he pierced the latter's charioteer also<br>with seven. Then, O king, Karna thus afflicted by Bhima's might, became<br>exceedingly distressed. And that illustrious warrior then fled, forsaking<br>the battle, borne away by his fleet steeds. The Atiratha Bhimasena,<br>however, drawing his bow adorned with gold, stayed in battle, looking<br>resplendent like a blazing fire.'"
