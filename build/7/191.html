                            "Sanjaya said, 'Then Drona caused a great carnage among the Panchalas,<br>like the slaughter caused by Sakra himself in rage amongst the Danavas in<br>the days of yore. The great car-warriors of the Pandava army, endued with<br>might and energy, though slaughtered, O king, by Drona's weapons, were<br>not yet afraid of Drona in that battle. Indeed, O monarch, those mighty<br>car-warriors, viz., the Panchalas and the Srinjayas, all rushed against<br>Drona himself, for fighting with him. Loud and fierce were the yells they<br>uttered as they rushed towards Drona for encompassing him on all sides<br>and were slaughtered by him with shafts and darts. Beholding the<br>slaughter of the Panchalas in that battle by the illustrious Drona, and<br>seeing his, weapons overwhelm all sides, fear entered the hearts of the<br>Pandavas. Beholding that dreadful carnage of steeds and human beings in<br>that battle, the Pandavas, O monarch, became hopeless of victory. (They<br>began to say unto each other) 'Is it not evident that Drona, that warrior<br>conversant with the mightiest of weapons, will consume us all like a<br>raging conflagration consuming a heap of straw in the season of spring?<br>There is none competent to even look at him in battle. Conversant with<br>the ways of morality, Arjuna (who alone is a match for him) will not<br>fight with him.' Beholding the sons of Kunti afflicted with the shafts of<br>Drona and inspired with fear, Kesava, endued with great intelligence and,<br>devoted to their welfare, addressed Arjuna and said, 'This foremost of<br>all bowmen is incapable of being ever vanquished by force in battle, by<br>the very gods with Vasava at their head. When, however, he lays aside his<br>weapons, he becomes capable of being slain on the field even by human<br>beings. Casting aside virtue, ye sons of Pandu, adopt now some<br>contrivance for gaining the victory, so that Drona of the golden car may<br>not slay us all in battle. Upon the full of (his son) Aswatthaman he will<br>cease to fight, I think. Let sonic man, therefore, tell him that<br>Aswatthaman, hath been slain in battle.' This advice, however, O kin was<br>not approved by Kunti's son, Dhananjaya. Others approved of it. But<br>Yudhishthira accepted it with great difficulty. Then the mighty-armed<br>Bhima, O king, slew with a mace a foe-crushing, terrible and huge<br>elephant named Aswatthaman, of his own army, belonging to Indravarman,<br>the chief of the Malavas. Approaching Drona then in that battle with some<br>bashfulness Bhimasena began to exclaim aloud, 'Aswatthaman hath been<br>slain.' That elephant named Aswatthaman having been thus slain, Bhima<br>spoke of Aswatthaman's slaughter. Keeping the true fact within his mind,<br>he said what was untrue, Hearing those highly disagreeable words of Bhima<br>and reflecting upon them, Drona's limbs seemed to dissolve like sands in<br>water. Recollecting however, the prowess of his son, he soon came to<br>regard that intelligence as false. Hearing, therefore, of his slaughter,<br>Drona did not become unmanned. Indeed, soon recovering his senses, he<br>became comforted, remembering that his son was incapable of being<br>resisted by foes. Rushing towards the son of Prishata and desirous of<br>slaying that hero who had been ordained as his slayer, he covered him<br>with a thousand keen shafts, equipped with kanka feathers. Then twenty<br>thousand Panchala car-warriors of great energy covered him, while he was<br>thus careering in battle, with their shafts. Completely shrouded with<br>those shafts, we could not any longer see that great car-warrior who then<br>resembled, O monarch, the sun, covered with clouds in the season of<br>rains. Filled with wrath and desirous of compassing the destruction of<br>those brave Panchalas, that mighty car-warrior, that scorcher of foes,<br>viz., Drona, dispelling all those shafts of the Panchalas, then invoked<br>into existence the Brahma weapon. At that time, Drona looked resplendent<br>like a smokeless, blazing fire. Once more filled with rage the valiant<br>son of Bharadwaja slaughtering all the Somakas, seemed to be invested<br>with great splendour. In that dreadful battle, he felled the heads of the<br>Panchalas and cut off their massive arms, looking like spiked maces and<br>decked with golden ornaments. Indeed, those Kshatriyas, slaughtered in<br>battle by Bharadwaja's son fell down on the earth and lay scattered like<br>trees uprooted by the tempest. In consequence of fallen elephants and<br>steeds, O Bharata, the earth, miry with flesh and blood, became<br>impassable. Having slain twenty thousand Panchala car-warriors, Drona, in<br>that battle, shone resplendent like a smokeless, blazing fire. Once more<br>filled with rage, the valiant son of Bharadwaja cut off, with a<br>broad-headed arrow, the head of Vasudana from his trunk. Once more<br>slaying five hundred Matsyas, and six thousand elephants, he slew ten<br>thousand steeds. Beholding Drona stationed on the field for the<br>extermination of the Kshatriya race, the Rishis Viswamitra, and<br>Jamadagni, and Bharadwaja, and Gautama, and Vasishtha, and Kasyapa, and<br>Atri, and the Srikatas, the Prisnis, Garga, the Valkhilyas, the Marichis,<br>the descendants of Bhrigu and Angiras, and diverse other sages of subtle<br>forms quickly came thither, with the Bearer of sacrificial libations at<br>their head, and, desirous of taking Drona unto the region of Brahman,<br>addressed Drona, that ornament of battle, and said, 'Thou art fighting<br>unrighteously. The hour of thy death is come. Laying aside thy weapons in<br>battle, O Drona, behold us stationed here. After this, it behoveth thee<br>not to perpetrate such exceedingly cruel deeds. Thou art versed in the<br>Vedas and their branches. Thou art devoted to the duties enjoined by<br>truth, especially, thou art a Brahmana. Such acts do not become thee. Lay<br>aside thy weapons. Drive away the film of error that shrouds thee. Adhere<br>now to the eternal path. The period for which thou art to dwell in the<br>world of men is now full. Thou hast, with the Brahma weapon, burnt men on<br>earth that are unacquainted with weapons. This act that thou hast<br>perpetrated, O regenerate one, is not righteous. Lay aside thy weapons in<br>battle without delay, O Drona, do not wait longer on earth. Do not, O<br>regenerate one, perpetrate such a sinful act.' Hearing these words of<br>their as also those spoken by Bhimasena, and beholding Dhrishtadyumna<br>before him, Drona became exceedingly cheerless in battle. Burning with<br>grief and exceedingly afflicted, he enquired of Kunti's son Yudhishthira<br>as to whether his son (Aswatthaman) had been slain or not. Drona firmly<br>believed that Yudhishthira would never speak an untruth even for the sake<br>of the sovereignty of the three worlds. For this reason, that bull among<br>Brahmanas asked Yudhishthira and not any body else. He had hoped for<br>truth from Yudhishthira from the latter's infancy.<br><br>"Meanwhile, O monarch, Govinda, knowing that Drona, that foremost of<br>warriors, was capable of sweeping all the Pandavas off the face of the<br>earth, became much distressed. Addressing Yudhishthira he said, 'If Drona<br>fighteth, filled with rage, for even half-a-day, I tell thee truly, thy<br>army will then be annihilated. Save us, then, from Drona. under such<br>circumstances, falsehood is better than truth. By telling an untruth for<br>saving a life, one is not touched by sin. There is no sin in untruth<br>spoken unto women, or in marriages, or for saving king, or for rescuing a<br>Brahmana.'[252] While Govinda and Yudhishthira were thus talking with<br>each other, Bhimasena (addressing the king) said, 'As soon, O monarch, as<br>I heard of the means by which the high-souled Drona might be slain,<br>putting forth my prowess in battle, I immediately slew a mighty elephant,<br>like unto the elephant of Sakra himself, belonging to Indravarman, the<br>chief of the Malavas, who was standing within thy army. I then went to<br>Drona and told him, 'Aswatthaman has been slain, O Brahmana! Cease, then,<br>to fight. Verily, O bull among men, the preceptor did not believe in the<br>truth of words. Desirous of victory as thou art, accept the advice of<br>Govinda. Tell Drona, O King, that the son of Saradwat's daughter is no<br>more. Told by thee, that bull among Brahmanas will never fight. Thou, O<br>ruler of men, art reputed to be truthful in the three worlds.' Hearing<br>those words of Bhima and induced by the counsels of Krishna, and owing<br>also to the inevitability of destiny, O monarch, Yudhishthira made up his<br>mind to say what he desired. Fearing to utter an untruth, but earnestly<br>desirous of victory, Yudhishthira distinctly said that Aswatthaman was<br>dead, adding indistinctly the world elephant (after the name), Before<br>this, Yudhishthira's car had stayed at a height of four fingers' breadth<br>from the surface of the earth; after, however, he had said that untruth,<br>his (vehicle and) animals touched the earth. Hearing those words from<br>Yudhishthira, the mighty car-warrior Drona, afflicted with grief, for the<br>(supposed) death of his son, yielded to the influence of despair. By the<br>words, again, of the Rishis, he regarded himself a great offender against<br>the high-souled Pandavas. Hearing now about the death of his son, he<br>became perfectly cheerless and filled with anxiety; upon beholding<br>Dhrishtadyumna, O king, that chastiser of foes could not fight as<br>before.'"
