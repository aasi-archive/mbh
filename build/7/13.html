                            "Sanjaya said, 'After Drona had promised the kings seizure under those<br>limitations, thy troops hearing of (that promise about) Yudhishthira's<br>capture, uttered many leonine shouts, mingling them with the whiz of<br>their arrows and the blare of their conchs. King Yudhishthira the just,<br>however, O Bharata, soon learnt in detail, through his spies, everything<br>about the purpose upon which Bharadwaja's son was intent. Then bringing<br>together all his brothers and all the other kings of his army, king<br>Yudhishthira the just addressed Dhananjaya, saying, 'Thou hast heard, O<br>tiger among men, about the intention of Drona. Let such measures,<br>therefore, be adopted as may prevent the accomplishment of that purpose.<br>It is true, Drona, that grinder of foes, hath vowed his pledge, subject<br>to limitations, however, O great bowman, rest on thee. Fight thou,<br>therefore, today, O thou of mighty arms, in my vicinity, so that<br>Duryodhana may not obtain from Drona the fruition of his desire.'<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'As the slaughter of my preceptor can never be accomplished<br>by me, so, king, I can never consent to give thee up. O son of Pandu, I<br>would rather yield up my life in battle than fight against my preceptor.<br>This son of Dhritarashtra desireth sovereignty, having seized thee as a<br>captive in battle. In this world he will never obtain the fruition of<br>that desire of his. The firmament itself with its stars may fall down,<br>the Earth herself may split into fragments, yet Drona will, surely, never<br>succeed in seizing thee as long as I am alive. If the wielder of the<br>thunderbolt himself, or Vishnu at the head of the gods, assist him in<br>battle, still he shall not succeed in seizing thee on the field. As long<br>as I am alive, O great king, it behoveth thee not to entertain any fear<br>of Drona, although he is the foremost of all wielders of weapons. I<br>further say unto thee. O monarch, that my promise never remains<br>unfulfilled. I do not recollect having ever spoken any untruth. I do not<br>recollect having ever been vanquished. I do not recollect having ever,<br>after making a vow, left the least part of it unfulfilled.<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Then, O king, conchs and drums and cymbals and<br>smaller drums were sounded and beaten in the Pandava camp. And the<br>high-souled Pandavas uttered many leonine shouts. These and the awful<br>twang of their bow-strings and the slaps of palms reached the very<br>heaven. Hearing that loud blare of conchs that arose from the camp of the<br>mighty sons of Pandu, diverse instruments were sounded amongst thy<br>divisions also. Then thy divisions as also those of theirs were arrayed<br>in order of battle. And slowly they advanced against each other from<br>desire of battle. Then commenced a battle, that was fierce and that made<br>the hairs stand on their ends, between the Pandavas and the Kurus, and<br>Drona and the Panchalas. The Srinjayas, though struggling vigorously,<br>were unable to beat in battle the host of Drona as it was protected by<br>Drona himself. And so also the mighty car-warriors of thy son, skilled in<br>smiting, could not beat the Pandava host, as it was protected by the<br>Diadem-decked (Arjuna). Protected by Drona and Arjuna, both the hosts<br>seemed to stand inactive like two blossoming forests in the silence of<br>the night. Then he, of the golden car, (viz., Drona) like the Sun himself<br>of great splendour, crushing the ranks of the Pandavas, careered through<br>them at will. And the Pandavas, and the Srinjayas, through fear, regarded<br>that single warrior of great activity upon his quickly-moving car as if<br>multiplied into many. Shot by him, terrible shafts coursed in all<br>directions, frightening, O king, the army of Pandu's son. Indeed, Drona<br>then seemed as the Sun himself at mid-day covered by a hundred rays of<br>light. And as the Danavas were unable to look at Indra, so there was not<br>one amongst the Pandavas, who. O monarch, was able to look at the angry<br>son of Bharadwaja in that battle. The valiant son of Bharadwaja then,<br>having confound the (hostile) troops, speedily began to consume the<br>division of Dhrishtadyumna by means of sharp shafts. And covering and<br>obstructing all the points of the compass by means of his straight<br>shafts, he began to crush the Pandava force even there, where Prishata's<br>son was.'"
