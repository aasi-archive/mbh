                            "Sanjaya said, 'During the progress, O monarch, of that battle, making<br>the hair stand on end, and when all the combatants were filled with<br>anxiety and greatly afflicted, the son of Radha. O bull of Bharata's<br>race, proceeded against Bhima for battle, like an infuriated elephant in<br>the forest proceeding against another infuriated elephant.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'How raged that battle, in the neighbourhood of<br>Arjuna's car, between those two mighty car-warriors, viz., Bhima and<br>Karna, both of whom are endued with great strength? Once before Karna had<br>been vanquished by Bhimasena in battle. How, therefore, could the mighty<br>car-warrior Karna again proceed against Bhima? How also could Bhima<br>proceed against the Suta's son, that mighty warrior who is reckoned as<br>the greatest of car-warriors on earth? Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma,<br>having prevailed over Bhishma and Drona, did not fear anybody else so<br>much as the bowman Karna. Indeed, thinking of the mighty car-warrior<br>Karna, he passeth his nights sleeplessly from fear. How, then, could<br>Bhima encounter that Suta's son in battle? Indeed, O Sanjaya, how could<br>Bhima fight with Karna, that foremost of warriors, that hero devoted to<br>the Brahmanas endued with energy and never retreating from battle? How,<br>indeed, did those two heroes, viz., the Suta's son and Vrikodara, fight<br>with each other in that encounter which took place in the vicinity of<br>Arjuna's car? Informed before of his brotherhood (with the Pandavas), the<br>Suta's son is again, compassionate. Remembering also his words to Kunti,<br>how could he fight with Bhima? As regards Bhima also, remembering all the<br>wrongs formerly inflicted on him by the Suta's son, how did that hero<br>fight with Karna in battle? My son Duryodhana, O Suta, hopeth that Karna<br>will vanquish all the Pandavas in battle. Upon whom my wretched son<br>resteth his hope of victory in battle, how did he fight with Bhimasena of<br>terrible deeds? That Suta's son, relying upon whom my sons chose<br>hostilities with those mighty car-warriors (viz., the sons of Pandu), how<br>did Bhima fight with him? Indeed, remembering the diverse wrongs and<br>injuries done by him, how did Bhima fight with that son of Suta? How<br>indeed, could Bhima fight with that son of a Suta, who, endued with great<br>valour, had formerly subjugated the whole earth on a single car? How did<br>Bhima fight with that son of a Suta, who was born with a (natural) pair<br>of ear-rings? Thou art skilled in narration, O Sanjaya! Tell me,<br>therefore, in detail how the battle took place between those two, and who<br>amongst them obtained the victory?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Leaving Radha's son, that foremost of car-warriors<br>Bhimasena, desired to proceed to the place where those two heroes, viz.,<br>Krishna and Dhananjaya were. The son of Radha, however, rushing towards<br>him as he proceeded, covered him, O king, with dense showers of arrows,<br>like a cloud pouring, torrents of rain on a mountain. The mighty son of<br>Adhiratha, his face beautiful as a full-blown lotus, lighted up with a<br>smile, challenged Bhimasena to battle, as the latter was proceeding. And<br>Karna said, 'O Bhima, I dreamt not that thou knowest how to fight. Why<br>then dost thou show me thy back from desire of meeting with Arjuna? O<br>delighter of the Pandavas, this is scarcely fit for a son of Kunti.<br>Staying, therefore, where thou art, cover me with thy arrows.' Bhimasena,<br>hearing that challenge of Karna, brooked it not, but wheeling his car a<br>little, began to fight with the Suta's son. The illustrious Bhimasena<br>showered clouds of straight shafts. Desiring also to arrive at the end of<br>those hostilities by slaying Karna, Bhima began to weaken that hero<br>conversant with every weapon and clad in mail, and staying before him for<br>engaging in a single combat. Then mighty Bhima, that scorcher of foes,<br>that wrathful son of Pandu, having slain numerous Kauravas, shot diverse<br>showers of fierce shafts at Karna, O sire! The Suta's son, endued with<br>great strength, swallowed, by means of the power of his own weapons, all<br>those showers of arrows shot by that hero, possessed of the tread of an<br>infuriated elephant. Duly favoured by knowledge, that great bowman, viz.,<br>Karna, began in that battle, O monarch, to career like a preceptor (Of<br>Military science). The wrathful son of Radha, smiling the while, seemed<br>to mock Bhimasena as the latter was battling with great fury. The son of<br>Kunti brooked not that smile of Karna in the midst of many brave warriors<br>witnessing from all sides that fight of theirs. Like a driver striking a<br>huge elephant with a hook, the mighty Bhima, excited with rage, pierced<br>Karna whom he had obtained within reach, with many calf-toothed shafts in<br>the centre of the chest. And once more, Bhimasena pierced the Suta's son<br>of variegated armour with three and seventy well-shot and keen arrows<br>equipped with beautiful wings and eased in golden armour, each with five<br>shafts. And soon, within the twinkling of the eye, was seen a network of<br>shafts about Bhima's car caused by Karna. Indeed, O monarch, those shafts<br>shot from Karna's bow completely shrouded that car with its standard and<br>driver and the Pandava himself. Then Karna pierced the impenetrable<br>armour of Bhima with four and sixty arrows. And excited with rage he then<br>pierced Partha himself with many straight shafts capable of penetrating<br>into the very vitals. The mighty-armed Vrikodara, however, disregarding<br>those shafts shot from Karna's bow fearlessly struck the Suta's son.<br>Pierced with those shafts, resembling snakes of virulent poison, shot<br>from Karna's bow, Bhima, O monarch, felt no pain in that battle. The<br>valiant Bhima then, in that encounter, pierced Karna with two and thirty<br>broad-headed shafts of keen points and fierce energy, Karna, however,<br>with the greatest indifference, covered, in return, with his arrows, the<br>mighty-armed Bhimasena who was desirous of Jayadratha's slaughter.<br>Indeed, the son of Radha, in that encounter, fought mildly with Bhima,<br>while Bhima, remembering his former wrongs, fought with him furiously.<br>The wrathful Bhimasena could not brook that disregard by Karna. Indeed,<br>that slayer of foes quickly shot showers of arrows at Radha's son. Those<br>arrows, sped in that encounter by Bhimasena, fell on every limb of Karna<br>like cooing birds. Those arrows equipped with golden wings and keen<br>points, shot from Bhimasena's bow, covered the son of Radha like a flight<br>of insects covering a blazing fire. Karna, however, O king, shot showers<br>of fierce shafts in return, O Bharata. Then Vrikodara cut off, with Many<br>broad-headed arrows, those shafts resembling thunderbolts, shot by that<br>ornament of battle, before they could come at him. That chastiser of<br>foes, viz., Karna, the son of Vikartana, once more, O Bharata, covered<br>Bhimasena with his arrowy showers. We then, O Bharata, beheld Bhima so<br>pierced in that encounter with arrows as to resemble a porcupine with its<br>quilts erect on its body.[155] Like the sun holding his own rays, the<br>heroic Bhima held in that battle all those shafts, whetted on stone and<br>equipped with wings of gold, that were shot from Karna's bow. All his<br>limbs bathed in blood, Bhimasena looked resplendent like an Asoka tree in<br>spring adorned with its flowery burthen. The mighty-armed Bhima could not<br>brook that conduct, in battle, of the mighty-armed Karna. Rolling his<br>eyes ill wrath, he pierced Karna with five and twenty long shafts.<br>Thereupon, Karna looked like a white mountain with many snakes of<br>virulent poison (hanging from its sides). And once more, Bhimasena,<br>endued with the prowess of a celestial, pierced the Suta's son who was<br>prepared to lay down his life in battle, with six and then with eight<br>arrows. And, again, with another arrow, the valiant Bhimasena quickly cut<br>off Karna's bow, smiling the while. And he slew also with his shafts the<br>four steeds of Karna and then his charioteer, and then pierced Karna<br>himself in the chest with a number of long shafts endued with the<br>effulgence of the sun. Those winged shafts, piercing through Karna's<br>body, entered the earth, like the rays of the sun piercing through the<br>clouds. Afflicted with arrows and his bow cut off, Karna, though proud of<br>his manliness, felt great pain and proceeded to another car.'"
