                            "Sanjaya said, 'Seeding his uncle thus addressed in harsh and insulting<br>words by the Suta's son, Aswatthaman, uplifting his scimitar, furiously<br>rushed towards the latter. Filled with fury, Drona's son rushed towards<br>Karna, in the very sight of the Kuru king, like a lion at an infuriated<br>elephant.<br><br>"And Aswatthaman said, 'O lowest of men, Kripa was speaking of the<br>virtues truly possessed by Arjuna. Of wicked understanding as thou art,<br>thou rebukest, however, my brave uncle from malice. Possessed with pride<br>and insolence, thou braggest today of thy prowess, not regarding any of<br>the world's bowmen in battle![209] Where was thy prowess and where were<br>thy weapons when vanquishing thee in battle the wielder of Gandiva slew<br>Jayadratha in thy very sight? Vainly, O wretch of a Suta, dost thou<br>indulge in thy mind the hope of vanquishing him who formerly contended in<br>battle with Mahadeva himself. The very gods with the Asuras united<br>together and with Indra at their head had failed to vanquish Arjuna, that<br>foremost of all wielders of weapons, having Krishna only for his ally.<br>How then, O Suta, hopest thou, aided by these kings, to vanquish that<br>foremost of heroes in the world, viz., the unvanquished Arjuna, in<br>battle? Behold, O Karna of wicked soul, (what I do to thee) today! O<br>lowest of men, O thou of wretched understanding, I shall presently sever<br>thy head from thy trunk.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus saying, Aswatthaman made a furious rush at<br>Karna. The king himself, of great energy, and Kripa, that foremost of<br>men, held him fast. Then Karna said, 'Of wicked understanding, this<br>wretch of a Brahmana thinks himself brave and boasts of his prowess in<br>battle. Set him at liberty, O chief of the Kurus. Let him come in contact<br>with my might.'<br><br>"Aswatthaman said, 'O son of a Suta, O thou of wicked understanding, this<br>(thy fault) is pardoned by us. Phalguna, however, will quell this risen<br>pride of thine.'<br><br>"Duryodhana said, 'O Aswatthaman, quell thy wrath. It behoveth thee, O<br>giver of honours, to forgive. Thou shouldst not, O sinless one, be angry<br>with the Suta's son. Upon thee and Karna and Kripa and Drona and the<br>ruler of the Madras and Suvala's son resteth a great burthen. Drive away<br>thy wrath, O best of Brahmanas! Yonder, all the Pandava troops are<br>approaching from desire of fight with Radha's son. Indeed, O Brahmana,<br>yonder they come, challenging us all.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus pacified by the king, the high-souled son of<br>Drona, O monarch, whose ire had been excited, suppressed his wrath and<br>forgave (Karna). Then the preceptor Kripa, of noble heart, who is of a<br>quite disposition, O monarch, and mild temper, therefore, returned soon<br>unto him, said these words.'<br><br>"Kripa, said, 'O Suta's son of wicked heart, this (thy fault) is pardoned<br>by us. Phalguna, however, will quell this thy risen pride.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Then the Pandavas, O king, and the Panchalas,<br>celebrated for their prowess, uniting together approached in thousands,<br>uttering loud shouts; Karna also, that foremost of car-warriors, endued<br>with great energy, surrounded by many foremost ones among the Kuru<br>warriors and resembling Sakra in the midst of the celestials, waited,<br>drawing his bow and relying on the might of his own arms. Then commenced<br>a battle between Karna and the Pandavas. O king, that was exceedingly<br>dreadful and characterised by loud leonine roars. Then Pandavas, O<br>monarch, and the Panchalas, celebrated for their prowess, beholding the<br>mighty-armed Karna, loudly shouted, saying, 'There is Karna,' 'Where is<br>Karna in this fierce battle.'&#8212;'O thou of wicked understanding, O lowest<br>of men, fight with us!'&#8212;Others, beholding the son of Radha said, with<br>eyes expanded In wrath, 'Let this arrogant wretch of little<br>understanding, this son of a Suta, be slain by the allied kings. He hath<br>no need to live. This sinful man is always very hostile to the Parthas.<br>Obedient to the counsels of Duryodhana, this one is the root of these<br>evils. Slay him.' Uttering such words, great Kshatriya car-warriors,<br>urged by Pandu's son, rushed towards him, covering him with a dense<br>shower of arrows, for slaying him. Beholding all those mighty Pandavas<br>thus (advancing), the Suta's son, trembled not, nor experienced any fear.<br>Indeed, seeing that wonderful sea of troops, resembling Death himself,<br>that benefactor of thy sons, viz., the mighty and fight-handed Karna,<br>never vanquished in battle, O bull of Bharata's race, began, with clouds<br>of shafts, to resist that force on all sides. The Pandavas also fought<br>with the foe, shooting showers of shafts. Shaking their hundreds and<br>thousands of bows they fought with Radha's son, like the Daityas of old<br>fighting with Sakra. The mighty Karna, however, with a dense arrowy<br>shower of his own dispelled that downpour of arrows caused by those lords<br>of earth on all sides. The battle that took place between them, and in<br>which each party counteracted the feats of the other,' resembled the<br>encounter between Sakra and the Danavas in the great battle fought of<br>yore between the gods and the Asuras. The lightness of arm that we then<br>behold of the Suta's son was wonderful in the extreme, inasmuch as, all<br>his foes, fighting resolutely, could not strike him in that battle.<br>Checking the clouds of arrows shot by the (hostile) king, that mighty<br>car-warrior, viz., Radha's son, sped terrible arrows marked with his own<br>name at the yokes, the shafts, the umbrellas, the cars, and the steeds<br>(of his foes). Then those kings, afflicted by Karna and losing their<br>coolness, began to wander on the field like a herd of kine afflicted with<br>cold. Struck by Karna, large numbers of steeds and elephants and<br>car-warriors were seen there to drop down deprived of life. The whole<br>field, O king, became strewn with the fallen heads and arms of<br>unreturning heroes. With the dead, the dying, and the wailing warriors,<br>the field of battle, O monarch, assumed the aspect of Yama's domain. Then<br>Duryodhana, O king, witnessing the prowess of Karna, repaired to<br>Aswatthaman and addressing him, said, 'Behold, Karna, clad in mail, is<br>engaged with all the (hostile) kings. Behold, the hostile army, afflicted<br>with the arrows of Karna, is being routed like the Asura army overwhelmed<br>with the energy of Kartikeya. Seeing his army vanquished in battle by<br>that intelligent Karna, yonder cometh Vibhatsu from desire of slaying the<br>Suta's son. Let such steps, therefore, be taken as may prevent the son of<br>Pandu from slaying that mighty car-warrior viz., Suta's son, in the very<br>sight of us all.' (Thus addressed), Drona's son, and Kripa, and Salya,<br>and that great car-warrior, viz., the son of Hridika, beholding the son<br>of Kunti coming (towards them) like Sakra himself towards the Daitya<br>host, all advanced against Partha for rescuing the Suta's son. Meanwhile,<br>Vibhatsu, O monarch, surrounded by the Panchala I advanced against Karna,<br>like Purandara proceeding against the Asura Vritra.'[210]<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Beholding Phalguna excited with fury and looking<br>like the Destroyer himself, as he appears at the end of the Yuga what, O<br>Suta, did Vikartana's son Karna do next? Indeed, the mighty car-warrior<br>Karna, the son of Vikartana, had always challenged Partha. Indeed, he had<br>always said that he was competent to vanquish the terrible Vibhatsu. What<br>then, O Suta, did that warrior do when he thus suddenly met his ever<br>deadly foe?'[211]<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Beholding the son of Pandu rushing towards him like<br>an elephant towards a rival elephant, Karna fearlessly proceeded against<br>Dhananjaya. Partha, however, soon covered Karna who was thus advancing<br>with great impetuosity, with showers of straight shafts, equipped with<br>wings of gold. Karna also covered Vijaya with his shafts. The son of<br>Pandu then once more shrouded Karna with clouds of arrows. Then Karna,<br>filled with rage, pierced Arjuna with three shafts. The mighty<br>car-warrior, Arjuna, beholding Karna's lightness of hand, could not brook<br>it. That scorcher of foes shot at the Suta's son thirty straight shafts,<br>whetted on stone and equipped with blazing points. Endued with great<br>might and energy, he also pierced him, in rage, with another long arrow<br>on the wrist of his left arm, smiling the while. Karna's bow then dropped<br>from that arm of his, which had thus been pierced with great force. Then<br>the mighty Karna, taking up that bow within the twinkling of an eye, once<br>more covered Phalguna with clouds of shafts, displaying great lightness<br>of hard. Dhananjaya then, O Bharata, smiling the while, baffled with his<br>own shafts, that arrowy shower shot by the Suta's son. Approaching each<br>other, those two great bowmen, desirous of counteracting each other's<br>feats, continued to cover each other with showers of shafts. The battle<br>that took place between them, viz., Karna and the son of Pandu, became<br>exceedingly wonderful, like that between the two wild elephants for the<br>sake of a she-elephant in her season. Then the mighty bowman Partha,<br>beholding Karna's prowess, quickly cut of the latter's bow at the handle.<br>And he also despatched the four steeds of the Suta's son to Yama's abode<br>with a number of broad-headed shafts. And that scorcher of foes also cut<br>off from the trunk the head of Karna's driver. Then, the son of Pandu and<br>Pritha pierced the bowless, the steedless, and the driverless Karna with<br>four shafts. Then that bull among men Karna, afflicted with those shafts,<br>specially jumping down from that steedless car, mounted upon that of<br>Kripa. Beholding the son of Radha vanquished, thy, warriors, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, fled away in all directions. Seeing them fly away, king<br>Duryodhana himself checked them and said these words, 'Ye heroes, do not<br>fly away. Ye bulls among Kshatriyas, stay in battle. I myself will now<br>advance for slaying Partha in battle. I myself will slay Partha with the<br>assembled Panchalas. While I shall fight with the wielder of Gandiva<br>today, Partha will behold my prowess to resemble that of the Destroyer<br>himself at the end of the Yuga. Today the Parthas shall behold my shafts<br>shot in thousands to resemble flights of locusts. The combatants shall<br>behold me today shooting, bow in hand, dense showers of shafts, like<br>torrents of rain poured by the clouds at the end of the summer season. I<br>shall today vanquish Partha with my straight shafts. Stay, ye heroes, in<br>battle, and remove your fear or Phalguna. Encountering my prowess,<br>Phalguna shall never be able to bear it, like the ocean, the abode of<br>makaras, unable to overcome the continents.' Thus saying, the king<br>proceeded in rage, his eyes red in wrath, surrounded by a large host,<br>towards Phalguna. Beholding the mighty-armed Duryodhana thus proceeding,<br>Saradwat's son, approaching Aswatthaman, said these words, 'Yonder, the<br>mighty-armed Duryodhana, deprived of his senses by wrath, desireth to<br>fight with Phalguna, like an insect desiring to rush into a blazing fire.<br>Before this foremost of kings layeth down his life, in our very sight, in<br>this battle with Partha, prevent him (from rushing into the encounter).<br>The brave Kuru king can remain alive in battle as long only as he doth<br>not place himself within the range of Partha's shafts. Let the king be<br>stopped before he is consumed into ashes by the terrible shafts of<br>Partha, that resemble snakes just freed from their sloughs. When we are<br>here, O giver of honours, it seems to be highly improper that the king<br>should himself go to battle to fight, as if he had none to fight for him.<br>The life of this descendant of Kuru will be in great danger if he engages<br>in battle with the diademdecked (Arjuna), like that of an elephant<br>contending with a tiger.' Thus addressed by his maternal uncle, Drona's<br>son, that foremost of all wielders of weapons, quickly repaired unto<br>Duryodhana and addressing him, said these words, 'When I am alive, O son<br>of Gandhari, it behoveth thee not to engage thyself in battle,<br>disregarding me, O descendant of Kuru, that am ever desirous of thy good.<br>Thou needst not be at all anxious about vanquishing Partha. I will check<br>Partha! Stand here, O Suyodhana.'<br><br>"Duryodhana said, 'The preceptor (Drona) always protecteth the sons of<br>Pandu, as if they are his own sons. Thou also always never interferest<br>with those my foes. Or, it may be due to my misfortune, that thy prowess<br>never becometh fierce in battle. This may be due also to thy affection<br>for Yudhishthira or Draupadi. I myself am ignorant of the true reason.<br>Fie on my covetous self, for whose sake all friends, desirous of making<br>me happy, are themselves vanquished and plunged into grief. Except thee,<br>O son of Gotama's daughter, what foremost of all wielders of weapons of<br>there, what warrior, indeed, equal to Mahadeva himself in battle, that<br>would not, though competent, destroy the foe? O Aswatthaman; be pleased<br>with me and destroy my enemies. Neither the gods nor the Danavas are<br>capable of staying within the range of thy weapons, O son of Drona, slay<br>the Panchalas and the Somakas with all their followers. As regards the<br>rest, we will slay them, Protected by thee. Yonder, O Brahmana, the<br>Somakas and the Panchalas, possessed of great fame, are careering amid my<br>troops like a forest-conflagration. O mighty-armed one, check them as<br>also the Kailkeyas, O best of men, else, protected by the diadem-decked<br>(Arjuna), they will annihilate us all. O Aswatthaman, O chastiser of<br>foes, go thither with speed. Whether thou accomplishest it now or<br>afterwards, that feat, O sire, should be accomplished by thee. Thou hast<br>been born, O mighty-armed one, for the destruction of the Panchalas.<br>Putting forth thy prowess, thou shalt make the world destitute of<br>Panchalas. Even thus the reverend ones crowned with (ascetic) success,<br>have said. It will be as they have said. Therefore, O tiger among men,<br>slay the Panchalas with all their followers. The very gods with Vasava at<br>their head are incapable of staying within the range of thy weapons, what<br>need be said then of the Parthas and the Panchalas? These words of mine<br>are true. I tell thee truly, O hero, that the Pandavas united with the<br>Somakas are no match for thee in battle! Go, O mighty-armed one! Let<br>there be no delay. Behold, our army, afflicted with Partha's shafts, is<br>breaking and flying away. Thou art competent, O mighty-armed one, aided<br>by thy own celestial energy, to afflict, O giver of honours, the Pandavas<br>and the Panchalas.'"
