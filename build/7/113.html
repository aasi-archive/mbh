                            "Dhritarashtra said, Our army is equally possessed of many excellences.<br>It is equally regarded as superior. It is equally arrayed according to<br>the rules of science, and it is equally numerous, O Sanjaya![151] It is<br>always well-treated by us, and is always devoted to us. It is vast in<br>numerical strength, and presents a wonderful aspect. Its prowess had<br>before been tested. The soldiers are neither very old nor very young.<br>They are neither lean nor corpulent. Of active habits, of well-developed<br>and strong frames, they are free from disease. They are cased in mail and<br>well-equipped with arms. They are devoted to all kinds of armed<br>exercises. They are adepts in mounting upon and descending from the backs<br>of elephants, in moving forward and stepping back, in smiting<br>effectually, and in marching and retreating. Oftentimes have they been<br>tested in the management of elephants and steeds and cars. Having been<br>examined duly, they have been entertained on pay and not for the sake of<br>lineage, nor from favour, nor from relationship. They are not a rabble<br>come of their own accord, nor have they been admitted into my army<br>without pay. My army consists of well-born and respectable men, who are,<br>again, contented, well-fed, and submissive. They are sufficiently<br>rewarded. They are all famous and endued with great intelligence. They<br>are, again, O son, protected by many of our foremost counsellors and<br>others of righteous deeds, all of whom are best of men, resembling the<br>very Regents of the world. Innumerable rulers of earth, seeking to do<br>what is agreeable to us, and who have of their own well sided with us<br>with their forces and followers, also protect them. Indeed, our army is<br>like the vast ocean filled with the waters of innumerable rivers running<br>from all directions. It abounds in steeds and cars which, though<br>destitute of wings, still resemble the winged tenants of the air. It<br>seems also with elephants adorned whose cheeks flow with juicy<br>secretions. What can it, therefore, be but Destiny that even such an army<br>should be slain? (Ocean-like it is) vast number of combatants constitute<br>its interminable waters, and the steeds and other animals constitute its<br>terrible waves. Innumerable swords and maces and darts and arrows and<br>lances constitute the oars (plied on that ocean).[152] Abounding in<br>standards and ornaments, the pearls and gems (of the warriors) constitute<br>the lotuses that deck it. The rushing steeds and elephants constitute the<br>winds that agitate it into fury. Drona constitutes the fathomless cave of<br>that ocean, Kritavarman its vast vortex. Jalasandha its mighty alligator,<br>and Karna the rise of the moon that makes it swell with energy and pride.<br>When that bull amongst the Pandavas, on his single car, hath speedily<br>gone, piercing through that army of mine vast (though it be) like the<br>ocean, and when Yuyudhana also hath followed him, I do not, O Sanjaya,<br>see the prospect of even a remnant of my troops being left alive by<br>Savyasachin, and that foremost of car-warriors belonging to the Satwata<br>race. Beholding those two exceedingly active heroes pierce through (the<br>divisions placed in the van), and seeing the ruler of the Sindhus also<br>within reach of the shafts from Gandiva, what, indeed, was the measure<br>adopted by the Kaurava impelled by fate? At that time, when all were<br>fighting intently, what became of them? O sire, I regard the assembled<br>Kurus to be overtaken by Death himself. Indeed, their prowess also in<br>battle is no longer seen to be what it once was. Krishna and the son of<br>Pandu have both entered the (Kuru) host unwounded. There is none in that<br>host, O Sanjaya, capable of resisting them. Many combatants that are<br>great car-warriors were admitted by us after examination. They are all<br>honoured (by us) with pay as each deserves, and others with agreeable<br>speeches. There is none, O son, amongst my troops who is not honoured<br>with good offices (done to him). Each receives his assigned pay and<br>rations according to the character of his services. In my army, O<br>Sanjaya, there is none who is unskilled in battle, none who receives pay<br>less than what he deserves, or none who does not receive any pay. The<br>soldiers are adored by me, according to the best of my powers, with gifts<br>and honours and seats. The same conduct is followed towards them by my<br>sons, my kinsmen, and my friends. Yet on the very approach of<br>Savyasachin, have they been vanquished by him and by the grandson of<br>Sini. What can it be but Destiny? They who are protecting them, all<br>follow the same road, the protected with the protectors! Beholding Arjuna<br>arrived at the front of Jayadratha, what measure was adopted by my<br>foolish son? Beholding Satyaki also entering the host, what step did<br>Duryodhana think suitable to that occasion? Indeed, beholding those two<br>foremost of car-warriors who are beyond the touch of all weapons, enter<br>my host, what resolution was formed by my warriors in battle? I think,<br>beholding Krishna of Dasarha's race and that bull of Sini's race also<br>both engaged for Arjuna's sake my sons are filled with grief. I think,<br>seeing both Satwata and Arjuna pass through my army and the Kurus flying<br>away, my sons are filled with grief. I think, seeing their car-warriors<br>retreat in despair of subjugating the foe and set their hearts upon<br>flying away from the field, my sons are filled with grief. Their steeds<br>and elephants and cars and heroic combatants by thousands flying away<br>from the field in anxiety, my sons are filled with grief I think, seeing<br>many huge elephants fly away, afflicted with the shafts of Arjuna, and<br>others fallen and falling, my sons are filled with grief. I think, seeing<br>steeds deprived of riders and warriors deprived of cars by Satyaki and<br>Partha, my sons are filled with grief. I think, large bodies of steeds<br>slain or routed by Madhava and Partha, my sons are filled with grief. I<br>think, seeing large bodies of foot-soldiers flying away in all<br>directions, my sons, despairing of success, are filled with grief. I<br>think, seeing those two heroes pass through Drona's division unvanquished<br>within a moment, my sons are filled with grief. Stupefied am I, O son,<br>upon hearing that Krishna and Dhananjaya, those two heroes of unfading<br>glory, have both, with Satwata, penetrated into my host. After that<br>foremost of car-warriors among the Sinis, had entered my host, and after<br>he had passed through the division of the Bhojas, what did the Kauravas<br>do? Tell me also, O Sanjaya, how did the battle take place there where<br>Drona afflicted the Pandavas on the field. Drona is endued with great<br>might, is the foremost of all persons, is accomplished in weapons, and is<br>incapable of being defeated in battle. How could the Panchalas pierce<br>that great bowman in the fight? Desirous of Dhananjaya's victory, the<br>Panchalas are inveterate foes of Drona. The mighty car-warrior Drona also<br>is an inveterate foe of theirs. Thou art skilled in a narration, O<br>Sanjaya! Tell me, therefore, everything about what Arjuna did for<br>compassing the slaughter of the ruler of the Sindhus.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'O bull of Bharata's race, overtaken by a calamity that is<br>the direct result of thy own fault, thou shouldst not, O hero, indulge in<br>such lamentations like an ordinary person. Formerly, many of thy wise<br>well-wishers, numbering Vidura amongst them, had told thee, 'Do not, O<br>king, abandon the sons of Pandu.' Thou didst not then heed those words.<br>The man that heedeth not the counsels of well-wishing friends, weepeth,<br>falling into great distress, like thyself. He of Dasarha's race, O king,<br>had formerly begged thee for peace. For all that, Krishna of world-wide<br>fame, obtained not his prayer. Ascertaining thy worthlessness, and thy<br>jealousy towards the Pandavas, and understanding also thy crooked<br>intentions towards the sons of Pandu, and hearing thy delirious<br>lamentations, O best of kings, that puissant Lord of all the worlds, that<br>Being, acquainted with the truth of everything in all the worlds, viz.,<br>Vasudeva, then caused the flame of war to blaze forth among the Kurus.<br>This great and wholesale destruction hath come upon thee, brought about<br>by thy own fault. O giver of honours, it behoveth thee not to impute the<br>fault to Duryodhana. In the development of these incidents no merit of<br>thine is to be seen in the beginning, in the middle, or at the end. This<br>defeat is entirely owing to thee. Therefore, knowing as thou dost the<br>truth about this world, be quiet and hear how this fierce battle,<br>resembling that between the gods and the Asuras, took place. After the<br>grandson of Sini, that warrior of prowess incapable of being baffled, had<br>entered into thy host, the Parthas headed by Bhimasena also rushed<br>against thy troops. The mighty car-warrior Kritavarman, however, alone,<br>resisted, in that battle the Pandavas thus rushing in fury and wrath with<br>their followers against thy host. As the continent resists the surgings,<br>even so did the son of Hridika resist the troops of the Pandavas in that<br>battle. The prowess that we then beheld of the son of Hridika was<br>wonderful, inasmuch as the united Parthas succeeded not in transgressing<br>his single self. Then the mighty-armed Bhima, piercing Kritavarman with<br>three shafts, blew his conch, gladdening all the Pandavas. Then Sahadeva<br>pierced the son of Hridika with twenty shafts, and Yudhishthira the just<br>pierced him with five and Nakula pierced him with a hundred. And the sons<br>of Draupadi pierced him with three and seventy shafts, Ghatotkacha<br>pierced him with seven. And Virata and Drupada and Drupada's son<br>(Dhrishtadyumna) each Pierced him with five shafts, and Sikhandin, having<br>once pierced him with five, again pierced him smilingly with five and<br>twenty shafts. Then Kritavarman, O king, pierced every one of those great<br>car-warriors with five shafts, and Bhima again with seven. And the son of<br>Hridika felled both the bow and the standard of Bhima from the latter's<br>car. Then that mighty car-warrior, with great speed, wrathfully struck<br>Bhima, whose bow had been cut off with seventy keen shafts in the chest.<br>Then mighty Bhima, deeply pierced with those excellent shafts of<br>Hridika's son, trembled on his car like a mountain during an earthquake.<br>Beholding Bhimasena in that condition, the Parthas headed by king<br>Yudhishthira the just afflicted Kritavarman, O king, shooting at him many<br>shafts. Encompassing that warrior there with throngs of cars, O sire,<br>they cheerfully began to pierce him with their shafts, desiring to<br>protect the Wind-god's son in that battle. Then mighty Bhimasena<br>recovering consciousness, took up in that battle a dart made of steel and<br>equipped with a golden staff, and hurled it with great speed from his own<br>car at the car of Kritavarman. That dart resembling a snake freed from<br>its slough, hurled from Bhima's hands, fierce-looking, blazed forth as it<br>proceeded towards Kritavarman. Beholding that dart endued with the<br>splendour of the Yuga-fire coursing towards him, the son of Hridika cut<br>it in twain with two shafts. Thereupon, that dart decked with gold, thus<br>cut off, fell down on the earth, illumining the ten points of the<br>compass, O king, like a large meteor falling from the firmament. Seeing<br>his dart baffled, Bhima blazed forth in wrath. Then taking tip another<br>bow which was tougher and whose twang was louder, Bhimasena, filled with<br>wrath, attacked the son of Hridika in that battle. Then O king, Bhima, of<br>terrible might, struck Kritavarman, in the centre of the chest with five<br>shafts, in consequence of thy evil policy, O monarch! The ruler of the<br>Bhoja then, mangled in every limb, O sire, by Bhimasena, shone<br>resplendent in the field like a red Asoka covered with flowers. Then that<br>mighty bowman, viz., Kritavarman, filled with rage, smilingly struck<br>Bhimasena with three shafts, and having struck him forcibly, pierced in<br>return every one of those great car-warriors struggling vigorously in<br>battle, with three shafts. Each of the latter then pierced him in return<br>with seven shafts. Then that mighty car-warrior of the Satwata race,<br>filled with rage, cut off, smiling in that battle, with a razor-faced<br>shaft the bow of Sikhandin. Sikhandin then, seeing his bow cut off,<br>quickly took up a sword and a bright shield decked with a hundred moons.<br>Whirling his large shield, decked with gold, Sikhandin sent that sword<br>towards the car of Kritavarman. That large sword, cutting off, O king,<br>Kritavarman's bow with arrow fixed thereon, fell down on the earth, like.<br>O monarch, a bright luminary loosened from the firmament. Meanwhile,<br>those mighty car-warriors quickly and deeply pierced Kritavarman with<br>their shafts in that battle. Then that slayer of hostile heroes, viz.,<br>the son of Hridika, casting off, that broken bow, and taking up another,<br>pierced each of the Pandavas with three straight shafts. And he pierced<br>Sikhandin at first with three, and then with five shafts. Then the<br>illustrious Sikhandin, taking up another bow, checked the son of Hridika<br>with many swift-flying shafts, furnished with heads like tortoise nails.<br>Then, O king, the son of Hridika, inflamed with rage in that battle,<br>rushed impetuously at that mighty car-warrior, viz., the son of<br>Yajnasena, that warrior, O monarch, who was the cause of the illustrious<br>Bhishma's fall in battle. Indeed, the heroic Kritavarman rushed at<br>Sikhandin, displaying his might, like a tiger at an elephant. Then those<br>two chastisers of foes, who resembled a couple of huge elephants or two<br>blazing fires, encountered each other with clouds of shafts. And they<br>took their best of bows and aimed their arrows, and shot them in hundreds<br>like a couple of suns shedding their rays. And those two mighty<br>car-warriors scorched each other with their keen shafts, and shone<br>resplendent like two Suns appearing at the end of the Yuga. And<br>Kritavarman in that battle pierced that mighty car-warrior viz.,<br>Yajnasena's son, with three and seventy shafts and once more with seven.<br>Deeply pierced therewith, Sikhandin sat down in pain on the terrace of<br>his car, throwing aside his bow and arrows, and was overtaken by a swoon.<br>Beholding that hero in a swoon, thy troops, O bull among men, worshipped<br>the son of Hridika, and waved their garments in the air. Seeing Sikhandin<br>thus afflicted with the shafts of Hridika's son his charioteer quickly<br>bore that mighty car-warrior away from the battle. The Parthas, beholding<br>Sikhandin lying senseless on the terrace of his car, soon encompassed<br>Kritavarman in that battle with crowds of cars. The mighty car-warrior,<br>Kritavarman, then achieved a most wonderful feat there, inasmuch as,<br>alone, he held in check all the Parthas with their followers. Having thus<br>vanquished the Parthas, that mighty car-warrior then vanquished the<br>Chedis, the Panchalas, the Srinjayas, and the Kekayas, all of whom are<br>endued with great prowess. The forces of the Pandavas then, thus<br>slaughtered by the son of Hridika began to run in all directions, unable<br>to stay coolly in battle. Having vanquished the sons of Pandu headed by<br>Bhimasena himself, the son of Hridika stayed in battle like a blazing<br>fire. Those mighty car-warriors, afflicted with torrents of shafts and<br>routed by Hridika's son in battle, ventured not to face him.'"
