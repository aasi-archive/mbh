                            "Sanjaya said, Having slain Bhagadatta who was ever the favourite and I<br>friend of Indra and who was possessed of great energy, Partha<br>circumambulated him. Then the two sons of the king of Gandhara viz., the<br>brothers Vrishaka and Achala, those subjugators of hostile towns, began<br>to afflict Arjuna in battle. Those two heroic bowmen, uniting together,<br>began to deeply pierce Arjuna from the front and from behind with whetted<br>shafts of great impetuosity. Arjuna then with sharp shafts cut off the<br>steeds and driver and bow and umbrella and standard and car of Vrishaka,<br>the son of Suvala, into atoms. With clouds of arrows and diverse other<br>weapons, Arjuna then once more severely afflicted the Gandhara troops<br>headed by Suvala's son. Then Dhananjaya, filled with rage, despatched to<br>Yama's abode, with his shafts, five hundred heroic Gandharas with<br>upraised weapons. The mighty-armed hero then, quickly alighting from that<br>car whose steeds had been slain, mounted upon the car of his brother and<br>took up another bow. Then those two brothers, viz., Vrishaka and Achala,<br>both mounted on the same car, began incessantly to pierce Vibhatsu with<br>showers of arrows. Indeed, those high-souled princes, those relatives of<br>thine by marriage, viz., Vrishaka and Achala, struck Partha very<br>severely, like Vritra or Vala striking Indra of old. Of unfailing aim,<br>these two princes of Gandhara, themselves unhurt, began once more to<br>strike the son of Pandu, like the two months of summer afflicting the<br>world with sweat-producing rays.[57] Then Arjuna slew those princes and<br>tigers among men, viz., Vrishaka and Achala, staying on one car side by<br>side, with, O monarch, a single arrow. Then those mighty-armed heroes,<br>with red eyes and looking like lions, those uterine brothers having<br>similar features, together fell down from that car. And their bodies,<br>dear to friends, falling down upon the earth, lay there, spreading sacred<br>fame all around.<br><br>"Beholding their brave and unretreating maternal uncles thus slain by<br>Arjuna, thy sons, O monarch, rained many weapons upon him. Sakuni also,<br>conversant with a hundred different kinds of illusions, seeing his<br>brothers slain, created illusions for confounding the two Krishnas. Then<br>clubs, and iron balls, and rocks and Sataghnis and darts, and maces, and<br>spiked bludgeons, and scimitars, and lances, mallets, axes, and Kampanas,<br>and swords, and nails, and short clubs, and battle-axes, and razors, and<br>arrows with sharp broad heads, and Nalikas, and calf-tooth headed shafts,<br>and arrows having bony heads and discs and snake-headed shafts, and<br>spears, and diverse other kinds of weapons, fell upon Arjuna from all<br>sides. And asses, and camels, and buffaloes, and tigers, and lions, and<br>deer, and leopards, and bears, and wolves and vultures, and monkeys, and<br>various reptiles, and diverse cannibals, and swarms of crows, all hungry,<br>and excited with rage, ran towards Arjuna. Then Dhananjaya, the son of<br>Kunti, that hero conversant with celestial weapons, shooting clouds of<br>arrows, assailed them all. And assailed by that hero with those excellent<br>and strong shafts, they uttered loud cries and fell down deprived of<br>life. Then a thick darkness appeared and covered Arjuna's car, and from<br>within that gloom harsh voices rebuked Arjuna. The latter, however, by<br>means of the weapons called Jyotishka, dispelled that thick and awful<br>darkness. When that darkness was dispelled frightful waves of water<br>appeared. For drying up those waters, Arjuna applied the weapon called<br>Aditya. And in consequence of that weapon, the waters were almost dried<br>up. These diverse illusions, repeatedly created by Sauvala, Arjuna<br>destroyed speedily by means of the force of his weapons, laughing the<br>while. Upon all his illusions being destroyed, afflicted with Arjuna's<br>shafts and unmanned by fear, Sakuni fled away, aided by his fleet,<br>steeds, like a vulgar wretch. Then Arjuna, acquainted with all weapons,<br>showing his enemies the exceeding lightness of his hands, showered upon<br>the Kaurava host clouds of arrows. That host of thy son, thus slaughtered<br>by Partha, became divided into two streams like the current of Ganga when<br>impeded by a mountain. And one of those streams, O bull among men,<br>proceeded towards Drona, and the other with loud cries, proceeded towards<br>Duryodhana. Then a thick dust arose and covered all the troops. We could<br>not then see Arjuna. Only the twang of Gandivas was heard by us from off<br>the field. Indeed, the twang of Gandiva was heard, rising above the blare<br>of conchs and the beat of drums and the noise of other instruments. Then<br>on the southern part of the field took place a fierce battle between many<br>foremost warriors on the one side and Arjuna on the other. I, however,<br>followed Drona. The various divisions of Yudhishthira's force smote the<br>foe on every part of the field. The diverse divisions of thy son, O<br>Bharata, Arjuna smote, even as the wind in the summer season destroys<br>masses of clouds in the welkin. Indeed, as Arjuna came, scattering clouds<br>of arrows, like Vasava pouring thick showers of rain, there was none in<br>thy army who could resist that great fierce bowman, that tiger among men.<br>Struck by Partha, thy warriors were in great pain. They fled away, and in<br>flying killed many among their own number. The arrows shot by Arjuna,<br>winged Kanka feathers and capable of penetrating into every body, fell<br>covering all sides, like flights of locusts. Piercing steeds and<br>car-warriors and elephants and foot-soldiers, O sire, like snakes through<br>ant-hills, those shafts entered the earth. Arjuna never shot arrows, at<br>any elephant, steed or man. Struck with only one arrow, each of these,<br>severely afflicted, fell down deprived of life. With slain men and<br>elephant and shaft-struck steeds lying all about, and echoing with yells<br>of dogs and jackals, the field of battle presented a variegated and awful<br>sight. Pained with arrows, sire forsook son, and friend forsook friend<br>and son forsook sire. Indeed, every one was intent upon protecting his<br>own self. Struck with Partha's shafts, many warriors abandoned the very<br>animals that bore them.'"
