                            "Sanjaya said, 'Bhuri, O king, in that battle, resisted that foremost of<br>car-warriors, viz., the grandson of Sini, who advanced like an elephant<br>towards a lake full of water. The Satyaki, excited with wrath, pierced<br>his foe in chest with five keen shafts. At this, the latter's blood began<br>to flow. The Kuru warrior in that encounter similarly pierced with great<br>speed the grandson of Sini, that hero difficult of defeat in battle, with<br>ten shafts in the chest. Those warriors, drawing their bows to their<br>fullest stretch, and with eyes red in wrath, began, O king, to mangle<br>each other in that combat. The arrowy downpours of those two warriors,<br>both, excited with rage and resembling Death himself or the sun<br>scattering his rays, were exceedingly terrible. Shrouding each other with<br>shafts, each stayed before the other in that battle. For a short while<br>that battle proceeded equally. Then, O king, the grandson of Sini,<br>excited with rage and smiling the while, cut off the bow of the<br>illustrious Kuru warrior in that battle. Having cut off his bow, Satyaki<br>quickly pierced him in the chest with nine keen arrows and addressing<br>him, said, 'Wait! Wait!' That scorcher of foes deeply pierced his mighty<br>foe, quickly took up another bow and pierced the Satwata warrior in<br>return. Having pierced the Satwata hero with three shafts, O monarch,<br>Bhuri, then, smiling the while, cut off his foe's bow with a sharp and<br>broad-headed shaft. His bow being cut off, Satyaki, O king, maddened with<br>rage, hurled an impetuous dart at the broad chest of Bhuri. Pierced with<br>that dart, Bhuri fell down from his excellent car, covered with blood,<br>like the sun dropping down from the firmament. Beholding him thus slain,<br>the mighty car-warrior Aswatthaman, O Bharata, rushed impetuously against<br>grandson of Sini. Having addressed Satyaki, O king, saying, 'Wait, Wait,'<br>he shrouded him with showers of shafts, like the clouds pouring torrents<br>of rain on the crest of Merit. Beholding him rushing towards the car of<br>Sini's grandson, the mighty car-warrior Ghatotkacha, O king, uttering a<br>loud roar, addressed saying, Wait, Wait, O son of Drona! Thou shalt not<br>escape from me with life. I will presently slay thee like the six-faced<br>(Karttikeya) slaying (the Asura) Mahisha. I shall today, on the field,<br>purge thy heart of all desire of battle.' Having said these words, that<br>slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the Rakshasa (Ghatotkacha), with eyes red<br>like copper in wrath, rushed furiously against the son of Drona, like a<br>lion rushing against a prince of elephants. And Ghatotkacha sped at his<br>foe shafts of the measure of the Aksha of a car, and covered that bull<br>among car-warriors therewith, like clouds pouring torrents of rain. With<br>his own shafts resembling snakes of virulent poison, Drona's son,<br>however, in that battle, quickly dispelled that arrowy shower before it<br>could reach him. He then pierced that chastiser of foes, viz.,<br>Ghatotkacha, that prince of the Rakshasas, with hundreds of keen and<br>swift-coursing arrows, all capable of penetrating into the very vitals.<br>Thus pierced with those shafts by Aswatthaman, that Rakshasas, on the<br>field of battle, looked beautiful, O monarch, like a porcupine with<br>quills erect on its body. Then the valiant son of Bhimasena, filled with<br>rage, mangled the son of Drona with many fierce arrows, whizzing through<br>the air with the roar of thunder. And he rained on Aswatthaman a perfect<br>shower of arrows of diverse kinds; some, equipped with heads like razors;<br>some, shaped as the crescent; some, only pointed; some, frog-faced; some,<br>with heads resembling the boar's ear; some, barbed; and some of other<br>species.[221] Like the wind dispersing mighty masses of clouds, Drona's<br>son, O king, without his senses being agitated, destroyed with his own<br>terrible arrows, inspired by mantras with the force of celestial weapons,<br>that fierce, unbearable and unrivalled shower of weapons, whose sound<br>resembled the roar of thunder, and which fell incessantly upon him. It<br>seemed then that another encounter was taking place in the welkin between<br>weapons (as the combatants), which was terrible, and which, O king,<br>filled the warriors with awe. With the sparks all around, generated by<br>the clash of the weapons, shot by those two warriors, the welkin looked<br>beautiful as illumined by myriads of fire-flies in the evening. Drona's<br>son then, filling all the points of the compass with his shafts, shrouded<br>the Rakshasa himself, for doing what was agreeable to thy sons. Then<br>commenced a battle once more between Drona's son and the Rakshasa on that<br>night of thick darkness, which resembled the encounter between Sakra and<br>Prahlada. Then Ghatotkacha, filled with rage, struck Drona's son, in that<br>battle, on the chest with ten shafts, each resembling the Yuga-fire,<br>Deeply pierced the Rakshasa, the mighty son of Drona began to tremble in<br>that battle like a tall tree shaken by the wind. Supporting himself by<br>holding the flagstaff, he swooned away. Then all thy troops, O king,<br>uttered cries of Oh and Alas. Indeed, O monarch, all thy warriors then<br>regarded Drona's son as slain. Beholding Aswatthaman in that plight, the<br>Panchalas and the Srinjayas in that battle uttered leonine roars. Then<br>that crusher of foes, viz., the mighty car-warrior Aswatthaman,<br>recovering his senses, forcibly drawing the bow with his left hand,<br>stretching the bowstring to his ear, quickly shot a terrible shaft<br>resembling the rod of Yama himself, aiming at Ghatotkacha. That excellent<br>shafts, fierce and equipped with golden wings, piercing through the chest<br>of the Rakshasa, entered the earth, O king. Deeply pierced, O monarch, by<br>Drona's son who was proud of his prowess in battle, that prince of<br>Rakshasas, endued with great strength, sat down on the terrace of his<br>car. Beholding Hidimva's son deprived of his senses, his charioteer,<br>inspired with fear, speedily removed him from the field, bearing him away<br>from the presence of Drona's son. Having pierced that prince of<br>Rakshasas, viz., Ghatotkacha, in that encounter thus, Drona's son, that<br>mighty car-warrior, uttered a loud roar. Worshipped by thy sons as also<br>by all thy warriors, O Bharata, Aswatthaman's body blazed up like the<br>midday sun.<br><br>"As regards Bhimasena who was battling in from of Drona's cal king<br>Duryodhana himself pierced him with many whetted shafts. Bhimasena,<br>however, O Bharata, pierced him in return with nine arrows. Duryodhana,<br>then, pierced Bhimasena with twenty arrows. Covered with each other's<br>arrows on the field of battle, those two warriors looked like the sun and<br>the moon covered with clouds in the firmament. Then king Duryodhana, O<br>chief of Bharatas, pierced Bhima with five winged arrows and said, 'Wait!<br>Wait!' Bhima then, cutting off his bow as also his standard with keen<br>shafts, pierced the Kuru king himself with ninety straight arrows. Then,<br>Duryodhana filled with rage, taking up a more formidable bow, O chief of<br>the Bharatas, afflicted Bhimasena, at the van of battle, with many<br>whetted shafts, in the very sight of all the bowmen. Baffling those<br>shafts shot from Duryodhana's bow, Bhima pierced the Kuru king with five<br>and twenty short arrows. Duryodhana then, O sire, excited with wrath, cut<br>off Bhimasena's bow with a razor-faced arrow and pierced Bhima himself<br>with ten shafts in return. Then the mighty Bhimasena, taking up another<br>bow, quickly pierced the king with seven keen shafts. Displaying great<br>lightness of hand, Duryodhana cut off even that bow of Bhima. The second,<br>the third, the fourth, and the fifth, bow that Bhima took up were<br>similarly cut off. Indeed, O king, thy son, proud of his prowess and<br>desirous of victory, cut off Bhima's bow as soon as the latter took up<br>one. Seeing his bows repeatedly cut off, Bhima then hurled, in that<br>battle, a dart made wholly of iron and hard as the thunder. That dart<br>blazing as a flame of fire, resembled the sister of Death. The Kuru king,<br>however, in the very sight of all the warriors and before the eyes of<br>Bhima himself, cut in three fragments that dart, which coursed towards<br>him through the welkin with the splendour of fire and dividing it, as it<br>were by a straight line such as is visible on the head of a woman parting<br>her tresses. Then Bhima, O king, whirling his heavy and blazing mace,<br>hurled it with great force at the car of Duryodhana. That heavy mace<br>speedily crushed the steeds, the driver, and the car also, of thy son in<br>that encounter. Thy son, then, O monarch, afraid of Bhima and shrinking<br>within the narrowest compass, ascended another car, viz., that of the<br>illustrious Nandaka. Then Bhima, regarding Suyodhana to have been slain<br>amid the darkness of that night, uttered a loud leonine roar challenging<br>the Kauravas. Thy warriors regarded the king to be slain. All of them<br>uttered loud cries of Oh and Alas. Hearing the wails of the affrighted<br>warriors and the roars of the high souled Bhima, O king, king<br>Yudhishthira also regarded Suyodhana to have been slain. And the eldest<br>son of Pandu, thereupon, rushed quickly to the spot where Vrikodara, the<br>son of Pritha, was. And the Panchalas, the Srinjayas, the Matsyas, the<br>Kaikeyas, and the Chedis, speedily advanced, with all their might against<br>Drona from desire of slaying him. There also occurred a dreadful battle<br>between Drona and the enemy. And the combatants of both sides were<br>enveloped in thick gloom and struck and slew one another'."
