                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding the sons of Drupada, as also those of<br>Kuntibhoja, and Rakshasas too in thousands, slain by the son of Drona,<br>Yudhishthira and Bhimasena, and Dhrishtadyumna, the son of Prishata, and<br>Yuyudhana, uniting together, set their hearts firmly on battle. Then<br>Somadatta, once more filled with rage upon beholding Satyaki in that<br>battle, covered the latter, O Bharata, with a dense shower of arrows.<br>Then took place a battle, fierce and exceedingly wonderful to behold,<br>between thy warriors and those of the foe, both parties being solicitous<br>of victory. Fighting on behalf of Satyaki, Bhima pierced the Katirava.<br>hero with ten shafts. Somadatta, however, in return, pierced that hero<br>with a hundred arrows. Then Satwata, filled with rage, pierced with ten<br>keen shafts, endued with the force of the thunder, that old warrior<br>afflicted with grief on account of the death of his son, and who was,<br>besides, endued with every estimable virtue like Yayati, the son of<br>Nahusha. Having pierced him with great force, he struck him once more<br>with seven arrows. Then, fighting for the sake of Satyaki, Bhimasena<br>hurled at the head of Somadatta a new, hard and terrible Parigha. Satyaki<br>also filled with rage, shot at Somadatta's chest, in that battle, an<br>excellent shaft, keen and equipped with goodly wings and resembling fire<br>itself in splendour. The Parigha and the shaft, both terrible, fell<br>simultaneously upon the body of the heroic Somadatta. That mighty<br>car-warrior, thereupon, fell down. Beholding his son (Somadatta) thus<br>fallen into a swoon, Valhika rushed at Satyaki scattering showers of<br>arrows like a cloud in season. Then Bhima, for Satyaki's sake, afflicted<br>the illustrious Valhika with nine shafts and pierced him therewith at the<br>van of battle. Then the mighty-armed son of Pratipa, Valhika, filled with<br>great fury, hurled a dart at the chest of Bhima, like Purandara himself<br>hurling the thunder. Struck therewith, Bhima trembled (on his car) and<br>swooned away. The mighty warrior then, recovering his senses, hurled a<br>mace at his opponent. Hurled by the son of Pandu, that mace snatched away<br>the head of Valhika, who, thereupon, fell down lifeless on the earth,<br>like a tree struck down by lightning. Upon the slaughter of that bull<br>among men, viz., the heroic Valhika, ten of thy sons, each of whom was<br>equal unto Rama, the son of Dasaratha, in prowess, began to afflict<br>Bhima. They were Nagadatta, and Dridharatha, and Viravahu, and Ayobhuja,<br>and Dridha, and Suhasta, and Viragas and Pramatha, and Ugrayayin.<br>Beholding them Bhimasena became filled with rage. He then took up a<br>number of arrows, each capable of bearing a great strain. Aiming at each<br>of them one after another, he sped those arrows at them, striking each in<br>his vital part. Pierced therewith, they fell down from their cars,<br>deprived of energy and life, like tall trees from mountain cliffs broken<br>by a tempest. Having with those ten shafts slain those ten sons of thine,<br>Bhima shrouded the favourite son of Karna with showers of arrows. Then<br>the celebrated Vrikaratha, brother of Karna, pierced Bhima with many<br>arrows. The mighty Pandava, however, soon disposed of him effectually.<br>Slaying next, O Bharata, seven car-warriors among thy brother-in-law,<br>with his shafts, the heroic Bhima pressed Satachandra down into the<br>earth. Unable to bear the slaughter of the mighty car-warrior<br>Satachandra, Sakuni's brothers, viz., the heroic Gavaksha and Sarabha and<br>Bibhu, and Subhaga, and Bhanudatta, those five mighty car-warriors,<br>rushing towards Bhimasena, attacked him with their keen shafts. Thus<br>attacked with those shafts, like a mountain with torrents of rain.'[208]<br>Bhima slew those five mighty kings with five shafts of his. Beholding<br>those heroes slain many great kings began to waver.<br><br>"Then Yudhishthira, filled with wrath, began to destroy thy ranks, in the<br>sight, O sinless one, of the Pot-born (Drona) and of thy sons. Indeed,<br>with his shafts, Yudhishthira began to despatch to the regions of Yama<br>the Amvashthas, the Malavas, the brave Trigartas and the Sivis. And<br>cutting off the Abhishahas, the Surasenas, the Valhikas, and the Vasatis,<br>he caused the earth to be miry with flesh and blood. And he also<br>despatched within a trice, by means of many shafts, to Yama's domains,<br>the Yaudheyas, the Malavas, and large numbers, O king, of the Madrakas.<br>Then a loud uproar arose in the vicinity of Yudhishthira's car, amid<br>which was heard, 'Slay', Seize', 'Capture', Pierce', Cut into pieces'!<br>Beholding him thus slaying and routing thy troops, Drona, urged on by thy<br>son, shrouded Yudhishthira with showers of shafts. Drona filled with<br>great wrath, struck Yudhishthira with the Vayavya weapon. The son of<br>Pandu, however, baffled that celestial weapon with a similar weapon of<br>his own. Seeing his weapon baffled, the son of Bharadwaja, filled with<br>great wrath and desirous of slaying the son of Pandu, sped at<br>Yudhishthira diverse celestial weapons such as the Varuna, the Yamya, the<br>Agneya, the Tvashtra, and the Savitra. The mighty-armed Pandava, however,<br>conversant with morality, fearlessly baffled all those weapons of the<br>Pot-born that were hurled or in course of being hurled at him. Then the<br>Pot-born, striving to accomplish his vow and desirous also for thy son's<br>good, to slay the son of Dharma, invoked into existence, O Bharata, the<br>Aindra and the Prajapatya weapons. Then that foremost one of Kuru's race,<br>Yudhishthira, of the gait of the elephant or the lion, of broad chest and<br>large and red eyes, and endued with energy scarcely inferior (to that of<br>Drona) invoked into existence the Mahendra weapon. With that he baffled<br>the weapon of Drona. Seeing all his weapons baffled, Drona, filled with<br>wrath and desirous of accomplishing the destruction of Yudhishthira,<br>invoked into existence the Brahma weapon. Enveloped as we then were by a<br>thick gloom, we could not observe what passed. All creatures also, O<br>monarch, were filled with great fright. Beholding the Brahma weapon<br>uplifted, Kunti's son, Yudhishthira, O king, baffled it with a Brahma<br>weapon of his own. Then, all the foremost warriors applauded those two<br>bulls among men, viz., Drona and Yudhishthira, those great bowmen<br>acquainted with every mode of warfare. Abandoning Yudhishthira, Drona<br>then, with eyes red as copper in rage, began to consume the division of<br>Drupada with the Vayavya weapon. Oppressed by Drona, the Panchalas fled<br>away from fear, in the very sight of Bhimasena and of the illustrious<br>Partha. Then the diadem-decked (Arjuna) and Bhimasena, checking that<br>flight of their troops, suddenly encountered that hostile force with two<br>large throngs of cars. Vibhatsu, attacking the right and Vrikodara the<br>left, Bharadwaja's son was encountered, with two mighty showers of<br>shafts. Then the Kaikeyas, the Srinjayas, and the Panchalas of great<br>energy followed the two brothers, O king, accompanied by the Matsyas and<br>the Satwatas. Then the Bharata host, slaughtered by the diadem-decked<br>(Arjuna) and overcome with sleep and darkness, began to break. Drona, and<br>thy son himself, endeavoured to rally them. The combatants, however, O<br>king, were incapable of being then checked in their flight.'"
