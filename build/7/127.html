                            "Sanjaya said, 'After the son of Pandu had crossed that car-force, the<br>preceptor Drona, smiling the while, covered him with showers of arrows,<br>desirous of checking his course. Stupefying thy force then with his<br>powers of illusion, and drinking, as it were, those shafts shot from the<br>bow of Drona, Bhimasena rushed against those brothers (viz., thy sons).<br>Then many kings, that were all great bowmen, urged by thy sons, rushing<br>impetuously, began to surround him. Encompassed by them, O Bharata, Bhima<br>smiling the while and uttering a leonine roar, took up and hurled at them<br>with great force a fierce mace destructive of hostile ranks. That mace of<br>adamantine strength, hurled like Indra's thunder by Indra himself,<br>crushed, O king, thy soldiers in battle. And it seemed to fill, O king,<br>the whole earth with loud noise. And blazing forth in splendour, that<br>fierce mace inspired thy sons with fear. Beholding that mace of impetuous<br>course and endued with lightning flashes, coursing towards them, thy<br>warriors fled away, uttering frightful cries. And at the unbearable<br>sound, O sire, of that fierce mace, many men fell down where they stood,<br>and many car-warriors also fell down from their cars. Slaughtered by<br>Bhimasena armed with the mace, thy warriors fled away in fear from<br>battle, like the deer attacked by a tiger. The son of Kunti, routing in<br>battle those valorous foes of his, impetuously crossed that force like<br>Garuda of beautiful feathers.<br><br>"While Bhimasena, that leader of leaders of car-divisions, was engaged in<br>such carnage, Bharadwaja's son, O king, rushed at him. And Drona,<br>checking Bhima by means of his arrowy showers, suddenly uttered a leonine<br>roar that inspired the Pandavas with fear. The battle that took place<br>between Drona and the high-souled Bhima was, O king, furious and terrible<br>and resembled the encounter between the gods and the Asuras of old.<br>Heroic warriors by hundreds and thousands in that battle slain by the<br>keen shafts shot from the bow of Drona. The son of Pandu then, jumping<br>down from his car shut his eyes, O king, and rushed on foot with great<br>speed towards the car of Drona. Indeed, as a bovine bull easily bears a<br>heavy shower of rain, even so that tiger among men, viz., Bhima, bore<br>that arrowy downpour from Drona's bow. Struck in that battle, o sire, by<br>Drona, the mighty Bhima, seizing Drona's car by the shaft, threw it down<br>with great force. Thus thrown down in battle, O king, Drona, however,<br>quickly mounting another car, proceeded towards the gate of the array,<br>his driver urging his steeds at that time with great speed. That feat, O<br>thou of Kuru's race, achieved by Bhimasena, seemed exceedingly wonderful.<br>The mighty Bhima, then, mounting upon his own car, rushed impetuously<br>towards the army of thy son. And he crushed the Kshatriyas in battle,<br>like a tempest crushing rows of trees. Indeed, Bhima proceeded, resisting<br>the hostile warriors like the mountain resisting the surging sea. Coming<br>then upon the Bhoja-troops that were protected by the son of Hridika,<br>Bhimasena, O king, ground it greatly, and passed through it. Frightening<br>the hostile soldiers with the sound of his palms, O sire, Bhima<br>vanquished them all like a tiger vanquishing a herd of bovine bulls.<br>Passing through the Bhoja division and that of the Kamvojas also, and<br>countless tribes of Mlecchas too, who were all accomplished in fight, and<br>beholding that mighty car-warriors, Satyaki, engaged in fight, Bhimasena,<br>the son of Kunti, O monarch proceeded resolutely and with great speed,<br>desirous of having a sight of Dhananjaya. Transgressing all thy warriors<br>in that battle, the son of Pandu then sighted the mighty car-warrior<br>Arjuna engaged in the fight. The valiant Bhima, that tiger among men,<br>beholding Arjuna putting forth his prowess for the slaughter of the ruler<br>of the Sindhus, uttered a loud shout, like, O monarch, the clouds roaring<br>in the season of rains. Those terrible shouts of the roaring Bhimasena<br>were, O thou of Kuru's race, heard by both Arjuna and Vasudeva in the<br>midst of the battle. Both those heroes, simultaneously hearing that shout<br>of the mighty Bhima, repeatedly shouted from desire of beholding<br>Vrikodara Then Arjuna uttering loud roar, and Madhava also doing the<br>same, careered in battle like a couple of roaring bulls. Hearing then<br>that roar of Bhimasena, as also that of Phalguna armed with the bow,<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma, O king, became highly gratified. And<br>king Yudhishthira, hearing those sounds of Bhima and Arjuna, had his<br>grief dispelled. And the lord Yudhishthira repeatedly wished success to<br>Dhananjaya in battle.<br><br>"While the fierce Bhima was thus roaring, the mighty-armed Yudhishthira,<br>the son of Dharma, that foremost of virtuous men, smilingly reflected a<br>while and thus worded the thoughts that inspired his heart, 'O Bhima,<br>thou hast truly sent me the message. Thou hast truly obeyed the commands<br>of thy superior. They, O son of Pandu, can never have victory that have<br>thee for their foe. By good luck it is that Dhananjaya, capable of<br>shooting the bow with (even) his left hand, still liveth. By good luck,<br>the heroic Satyaki also, of prowess incapable of being baffled, is safe<br>and sound. By good luck, it is that I hear both Vasudeva and Dhananjaya<br>uttering these roars. He who having vanquished Sakra himself in battle,<br>had gratified the bearer of sacrificial libations, that slayer of foes,<br>viz., Phalguna, by good luck, still liveth in this battle. He, relying<br>upon the might of whose arms all of us are alive, that slayer of hostile<br>armies, Phalguna, by good luck, liveth still. He by whom with the aid of<br>a single bow the Nivatakavachas were vanquished, those Danavas, that is,<br>that were incapable of being defeated by the very gods, he, viz., Partha,<br>by good luck, liveth still. He who had vanquished in Matsya's city all<br>the Kauravas assembled together for seizing Virata's kine, that Partha,<br>by good luck, liveth still. He who, by the might of his arms, slew<br>fourteen thousands of Kalakeyas, that Partha, by good luck, liveth still.<br>He who, for Duryodhana's sake, had vanquished, by the energy of his<br>weapons, the mighty king of the Gandharvas, that Partha, by good luck,<br>liveth still. Decked with diadem and garlands (of gold), endued with<br>great strength, having white steeds (yoked to his car) and Krishna<br>himself for his charioteer, that Phalguna, always dear to me, by good<br>luck, liveth still. Burning with grief on account of the death of his<br>son, endeavouring to achieve a most difficult feat, and even now seeking<br>to slaughter Jayadratha, alas, he that hath made that vow, viz.,<br>Dhananjaya, will he succeed in slaying the ruler of the Sindhus in<br>battle? After he, protected by Vasudeva, will have accomplished that vow<br>of his, shall I behold that Arjuna again, before the sun sets? Shall the<br>ruler of the Sindhus who is devoted to Duryodhana's welfare, slain by<br>Phalguna, gladden his foes? Shall king Duryodhana, beholding the ruler of<br>the Sindhus slain in battle make peace with us? Beholding his brother<br>slain in battle by Bhimasena shall the wicked Duryodhana make peace with<br>us? Beholding other great warriors lying prostrate on the surface of the<br>earth, shall wicked Duryodhana give way to remorse? Shall not our<br>hostilities cease with the single sacrifice of Bhishma? Shall that<br>Suyodhana, make peace with us for saving the remnant (of what is still<br>left to him and us)? Diverse reflections of this kind passed through the<br>mind of king Yudhishthira who was overwhelmed with compassion. Meanwhile,<br>the battle (between the Pandavas and the Kauravas) raged furiously.'"
