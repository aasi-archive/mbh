                            "Narada said, 'Gaya, the son of Amartarayas, O Srinjaya, we hear, fell a<br>prey to death, That king, for a hundred years, ate nothing but what<br>remained of the libations of clarified butter poured into the sacrificial<br>fire. Agni (gratified with his proof of great devotion) offered to give<br>him a boon. Gaya solicited the boon (desired), saying, 'I desire to have<br>a thorough knowledge of the Vedas through ascetic penances, through<br>practice of Brahmacharya, and of vows and rules, and through the grace of<br>my superiors.[107] I desire also inexhaustible wealth, through practice<br>of the duties of my own order and without injury to others. I wish also<br>that I may always be able to make gifts unto the Brahmanas, with<br>devotion. Let me also procreate sons upon wives belonging to my own order<br>and not upon others. Let me be able to give away food with devotion. Let<br>my heart always delight in righteousness. O (Agni) thou supreme cleanser,<br>let no impediment overtake me while I am engaged in acts for the<br>attainment of religious merit.' Saying 'Be it so,' Agni disappeared then<br>and there. And Gaya also, acquiring all he had asked for, subjugated his<br>foes in fair fight. King Gaya then performed, for a full hundred years,<br>diverse kinds of sacrifices with profuse presents unto the Brahmanas and<br>the vows called Chaturmasyas and others. Every year, for a century, the<br>king gave (unto the Brahmanas) one hundred and sixty thousand kine, ten<br>thousand steeds, and one crore gold (nishkas) upon rising (on the<br>completion of his sacrifices). Under every constellation also he gave<br>away the presents ordained for each of these occasions.[108] Indeed, the<br>king performed various sacrifices like another Soma or another Angiras.<br>In his great Horse-sacrifice, king Gaya, making a golden earth, gave her<br>away unto the Brahmanas. In that sacrifice, the stakes of king Gaya were<br>exceedingly costly, being of gold, decked with gems delightful to all<br>creatures. Capable of killing every wish, Gaya gave those stakes unto<br>well-pleased Brahmanas and other people. The diverse classes of creatures<br>dwelling in the ocean, the woods, the islands, the rivers male and<br>female, the waters, the towns, the provinces, and even in heaven, were<br>all gratified with wealth and food distributed at Gaya's sacrifices. And<br>they all said, 'No other sacrifice can come up to this one of Gaya. The<br>sacrificial altar of Gaya was thirty Yojanas in length, six and twenty<br>Yojanas in width, and twenty Yojanas in height. And it was made entirely<br>of gold, and overspread with pearls and diamonds and gems. And he gave<br>away this altar unto the Brahmanas, as also robes and ornaments. And the<br>munificent monarch also gave unto the Brahmanas other presents of the<br>kind laid down (in the scriptures). Upon the completion of that sacrifice<br>five and twenty hills of food remained untouched, and many lakes and<br>several beautifully flowing rivulets of juicy drinks, and many heaps,<br>besides, of robes and ornaments. And in consequence of the merit of that<br>great sacrifice, Gaya came to be well-known in the three worlds. And due<br>to that sacrifice are the eternal Banian and the sacred Brahmasara. When<br>he died, O Srinjaya, who was superior to thee in respect of four cardinal<br>virtues and who superior to thee, was, therefore, much superior to thy<br>son, thou shouldst not, saying, 'Oh, Swaitya, Oh, Swaitya,' grieve for<br>the latter who performed no sacrifice and made no sacrificial present.'"
