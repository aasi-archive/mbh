                            "Sanjaya said 'Beholding Somadatta shaking his large bow, Satyaki,<br>addressing his driver, said, 'Bear me towards Somadatta. I tell thee<br>truely, O Suta, that I shall not return from battle today without having<br>slain that foe, viz., that worst of the Kurus, the son of Valhika'. Thus<br>addressed, the charioteer then urged to battle those fleet steeds of the<br>Sindhu breed, white as conch and capable of bearing every weapon. Those<br>steeds endued with the speed of the wind or the mind, bore Yuyudhana to<br>battle like the steeds of Indra, O king, bearing the latter in days of<br>yore when he proceeded to quell the Danavas. Beholding the Satwata hero<br>thus advancing quickly in battle Somadatta, O king, fearlessly turned<br>towards him. Scattering showers of shafts like the clouds pouring<br>torrents of rain, he covered the grandson of Sini like the clouds<br>covering the sun. Satyaki also, O bull of Bharata's race, in that<br>encounter fearlessly covered that bull amongst the Kurus with showers of<br>shafts. Then Somadatta pierced that hero of Madhu's race with sixty<br>shafts in the chest. Satyaki, in turn, O king, pierced Somadatta with<br>many whetted arrows. Mangled by each other with each-other's shafts,<br>those two warriors looked resplendent like a couple of flowering Kinsukas<br>in the season of spring. Dyed all over with blood, those illustrious<br>warriors of the Kuru and the Vrishni races looked at each other with<br>their glances. Riding on their cars that coursed in circles, those<br>grinders of foes, of terrible countenances, resembled two clouds pouring<br>torrents of rain. Their bodies mangled and pierced all over with arrows,<br>they looked, O king, like two porcupines. Pierced with countless shafts,<br>equipped with wings of gold, the two warriors looked resplendent, O<br>monarch, like a couple of tall trees covered with fire-flies. Their<br>bodies looking bright with the blazing arrows sticking to them, those two<br>mighty car-warriors looked in that battle like two angry elephants decked<br>with burning torches. Then, O monarch, the mighty car-warrior, Somadatta,<br>in that battle, cut off with a crescent-shaped arrow the large bow of<br>Madhava. With great speed also, at a time when speed was of the utmost<br>consequence, the Kuru hero then pierced Satyaki with five and twenty<br>shafts, and once again with ten. Then Satyaki, taking up a tougher bow,<br>quickly pierced Somadatta with five shafts. With another broad-headed<br>arrow, Satyaki also, O king, smiling the while, cut off the golden<br>standard of Valhika's son. Somadatta, however, beholding his standard cut<br>down, fearlessly pierced the grandson of Sini with five and twenty<br>arrows. Satwata also, excited with rage, cut off with a razor-faced arrow<br>the bow of Somadatta, in that encounter. And he also pierced Somadatta<br>who then resembled a snake without fangs, with a hundred straight arrows,<br>equipped with wings of gold. The mighty car-warrior Somadatta, then, who<br>was endued with great strength taking up another bow, began to cover<br>Satyaki (with showers of shafts). Satyaki too, inflamed with rage,<br>pierced Somadatta with many shafts. Somadatta, in return, afflicted<br>Satyaki with his arrowy showers. Then Bhima coming to the encounter, and<br>fighting on behalf of Satyaki, struck Valhika's son with ten shafts.<br>Somadatta, however, fearlessly struck Bhimasena with many whetted arrows.<br>Then Satyaki, inflamed with rage, aiming at Somadatta's chest, shot a new<br>and terrible Parigha equipped with a golden staff and hard as the<br>thunder. The Kuru warrior, however, smiling the while, cut off that<br>terrible Parigha advancing with speed against him in two parts. That<br>formidable Parigha of iron, then, thus cut off into two fragments, fell<br>down like so many crests of a mountain riven by thunder. Then Satyaki, O<br>king, with a broad-headed arrow, cut off in that encounter Somadatta's<br>bow, and then with five arrows, the leathern fence that cased his<br>fingers. Then, O Bharata, with four other shafts he speedily despatched<br>the four excellent steeds of the Kuru warrior to Yama's presence. And<br>then that tiger among car-warriors with another straight shaft, smiling<br>the while, cut off from his trunk the head of Somadatta's driver. Then he<br>sought at Somadatta himself a terrible shaft of fiery effulgence, whetted<br>on stone, steeped in oil, and equipped with wings of gold. That excellent<br>and fierce shaft, shot by the mighty grandson of Sini, quickly fell like<br>a hawk, O Lord, upon the chest of Somadatta. Deeply pierced by the mighty<br>Satwata, the great car-warrior Somadatta, O monarch, fell down (from his<br>car) and expired. Beholding the great car-warrior Somadatta slain there,<br>thy warriors with a large throng of cars rushed against Yuyudhana.<br>Meanwhile, the Pandava also, O king, with all the Prabhadrakas and<br>accompanied by a large force, rushed against Drona's army. Then<br>Yudhishthira, excited with wrath, began, with his shafts, to strike and<br>rout the troops of Bharadwaja's son at the very sight of the latter.<br>Beholding Yudhishthira thus agitating his troops, Drona, with eyes red in<br>wrath, furiously rushed against him. The preceptor, then pierced the son<br>of Pritha with seven keen arrows. Yudhishthira, in return, excited with<br>wrath, pierced the preceptor with five arrows. Deeply pierced by the son<br>of Pandu, the mighty bowman (Drona), licking the corners of his mouth for<br>a moment, cut off both the standard and the bow of Yudhishthira. With<br>great speed, at a time when speed was of the utmost consequence, that<br>best of kings, whose bow had been cut off, took up another bow that was<br>sufficiently tough and hard. The son of Pandu then pierced Drona with his<br>steeds, driver, standard, and car, with a thousand arrows. All this<br>seemed exceedingly wonderful. Afflicted with the strokes of those arrows<br>and feeling great pain, Drona, that bull among Brahmanas, sat down for a<br>while on the terrace of his car. Recovering his senses, sighing like a<br>snake, and filled with great rage, the preceptor invoked into existence<br>the Vayavya weapon. The valiant son of Pritha, bow in hand, fearlessly<br>baffled that weapon with a similar weapon of his in that encounter. And<br>the son of Pandu also cut in two fragments the large bow of the Brahmana.<br>Then Drona, that grinder of Kshatriyas, took up another bow. That bull of<br>Kuru's race, Yudhishthira, cut off that bow also, with many keen shafts.<br>Then Vasudeva, addressing Yudhishthira. the son of Kunti, said, 'Listen,<br>O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, to what I say. Cease, O best of the<br>Bharatas, to fight with Drona. Drona always striveth to seize thee in<br>battle. I do not think it fit that thou shouldst fight with him. He who<br>hath been created for Drona's destruction will, without doubt, slay him.<br>Leaving the preceptor, go where king Suyodhana is. Kings should fight<br>with kings, they should not desire to fight with such as are not kings.<br>Surrounded, therefore, by elephants and steeds and cars, repair thou<br>thither, O son of Kunti, where Dhananjaya with myself, aided by a small<br>force, and Bhima also, that tiger among men, are fighting with the<br>Kurus'. Hearing these words of Vasudeva, king Yudhishthira the just,<br>reflecting for a moment, proceeded to that part of the field where that<br>slayer of foes, viz., Bhima, engaged in fierce battle, was slaughtering<br>thy troops like the Destroyer himself with wide-open mouth. Making the<br>earth resound with the loud rattle of his car, which resembled the roar<br>of the clouds at the end of summer, king Yudhishthira the just, the<br>(eldest) son of Pandu, took up the flank of Bhima, engaged in the<br>slaughter of the foe. Drona also on that night, began to consume his<br>foes, the Panchalas'"
