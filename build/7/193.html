                            "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding those feats of the Satwata hero, Duryodhana and<br>others, filled with rage, quickly encompassed the grandson of Sini on all<br>sides. Kripa and Karna, of also thy sorts, O sire, in that battle,<br>quickly approaching the grandson of Sini, began to strike him with keen<br>arrows. Then king Yudhishthira, and the two other Pandavas, viz., the two<br>sons of Madri and Bhimasena of great might surrounded Satyaki (for<br>protecting him). Karna, and the mighty car-warrior Kripa, and Duryodhana<br>and others, all resisted Satyaki, pouring showers of arrows on him. The<br>grand son of Sini, however, contending with all those car-warriors,<br>baffled, O monarch, that terrible downpour of arrows, so suddenly created<br>by his foes. Indeed, in that dreadful battle, Satyaki, by means of his<br>own celestial weapons, duly resisted all those celestial weapons aimed at<br>him by those illustrious warriors. The field of battle became full of<br>many cruel sights upon that encounter of those royal combatants,<br>resembling that scene of yore when Rudra, filled with rage, had destroyed<br>all creatures. Human arms and heads and bows, O Bharata, and umbrellas<br>displaced (from cars), and yak-tails, were seen lying in heaps on the<br>field of battle. The earth became quickly strewn with broken wheels and<br>cars, and massive arms lopped off from trunks, and brave horsemen<br>deprived of life. And, O foremost one among the Kurus, large number of<br>warriors, mangled with falling arrows, were seen in that great battle to<br>roll and writhe on the ground in agony of the last spasms of death.<br>During the progress of that terrible battle, resembling the encounter in<br>days of old between the celestials and the Asuras, king Yudhishthira the<br>just, addressing his warriors, said, Putting forth all your vigour, rush,<br>ye great car-warriors, against the Pot-born! Yonder the heroic son of<br>Prishata is engaged with Drona! He is endeavouring to the utmost of his<br>might, to slay the son of Bharadwaja. Judging from the aspect he is<br>presenting in this great battle, it is evident that filled with rage, he<br>will today overthrow Drona. Uniting together, all of you fight with the<br>Pot-born.' Thus ordered by Yudhishthira, the mighty car-warriors of the<br>Srinjayas all rushed with great vigour to slay the son of Bharadwaja.<br>That mighty car-warrior, viz., Bharadwaja's son, quickly rushed against<br>those advancing warriors, knowing for certain that he would die. When<br>Drona, of sure aim, thus proceeded, the earth trembled violently. Fierce<br>winds began to blow, inspiring the (hostile) ranks with fear. Large<br>meteors fell, seemingly issuing out of the sun, blazing fiercely as they<br>fell and foreboding great terrors. The weapons of Drona, O sire, seemed<br>to blaze forth. Cars seemed to produce loud rattles, and steeds to shed<br>tears. The mighty car-warrior, Drona, seemed to be divested of his<br>energy, His left eye and left hand began to twitch. Beholding Prishata's<br>son, again, before him, and bearing in mind the words of the Rishis about<br>his leaving the world for heaven, he became cheerless. He then desired to<br>give up life by fighting fairly. Encompassed on all sides by the troops<br>of Drupada's son, Drona began to career in battle, consuming large<br>numbers of Kshatriyas. That grinder of foes, having slain four and twenty<br>thousand Kshatriyas, then despatched to Yama's abode ten times ten<br>thousand, by means of his shafts of keen points. Exerting himself with<br>care, he seemed to stand in that battle like a smokeless fire. For the<br>extermination of the Kshatriya race, he then had recourse to the Brahma<br>weapon. Then the mighty Bhima, beholding the illustrious and irresistible<br>prince of the Panchalas carless and weaponless, quickly proceeded towards<br>him. Beholding him striking at Drona from a near point, that grinder of<br>foes took up Dhrishtadyumna on his own car and said unto him, 'Save thee<br>there is no other man that can venture to fight with the preceptor. Be<br>quick to slay him. The burden of his slaughter rests upon thee.' Thus<br>addressed by Bhima, the mighty-armed Dhrishtadyumna speedily took up a<br>strong, a new and a superb bow capable of bearing a great strain. Filled<br>with rage, and shooting his arrows in that battle at the irresistible<br>Drona, Dhrishtadyumna covered the preceptor, desirous of withstanding<br>him. Those two ornaments of battle then, both foremost of fighters and<br>both filled with rage, invoked into existence the Brahma and diverse<br>other celestial weapons. Indeed, O king, Dhrishtadyumna covered Drona<br>with many mighty weapons in that encounter. Destroying all the weapons of<br>Bharadwaja's son, the Panchala prince, that warrior of unfading glory,<br>began to slay the Vasatis, the Sivis, the Valhikas and the Kurus, that<br>is, them, who protected Drona in that battle. Indeed, O king, shooting<br>showers of arrows on all sides, Dhrishtadyumna at that time looked<br>resplendent like the sun himself shedding his thousands of rays. Drona,<br>however, once more cut off the prince's bow and pierced the vitals of the<br>prince himself with many arrows. Thus pierced, the prince felt great<br>pain. Then Bhima, of great wrath, holding the car of Drona, O monarch,<br>slowly said these words unto him: If wretches amongst Brahmanas,<br>discontented with the avocations of their own order, but well-versed in<br>arms, did not fight, the Kshatriya order then would not have been thus<br>exterminated. Abstention from injury to all creatures hath been said to<br>be the highest of all virtues. The Brahmana is the root of that virtue.<br>As regards thyself, again, thou art the foremost of all persons<br>acquainted with Brahma. Slaying all those Mlecchas and other warriors,<br>who, however, are all engaged in the proper avocations of their order,<br>moved thereto by ignorance and folly, O Brahmana, and by the desire of<br>wealth for benefiting sons and wives; indeed, for the sake of an only<br>son, why dost thou not feel ashamed? He for whom thou hast taken up<br>weapons, and for whom thou livest, he, deprived of life, lieth today on<br>the field of battle, unknown to thee and behind thy back. King<br>Yudhishthira the just hath told thee this. It behoveth thee not to doubt<br>this fact.' Thus addressed by Bhima, Drona laid aside his bow. Desirous<br>of laying aside all his weapons also, Bharadwaja's son of virtuous soul<br>said aloud, 'O Karna, Karna, O great bowman, O Kripa, O Duryodhana, I<br>tell you repeatedly, exert yourselves carefully in battle. Let no injury<br>happen to you from the Pandayas. As regards myself, I lay aside my<br>weapons.' Saying these words, he began loudly to take the name of<br>Aswatthaman. Laying aside his weapons then in that battle, and sitting<br>down on the terrace of his car, he devoted himself to Yoga and assured<br>all creatures, dispelling their fears. Beholding that opportunity,<br>Dhrishtadyumna mustered all his energy. Laying down on the car his<br>formidable bow, with arrow fixed on the bow-string, he took up a sword,<br>and jumping down from his vehicle, rushed quickly against Drona. All<br>creatures, human beings and others, uttered exclamation of woe, beholding<br>Drona thus brought under Dhrishtadyumna's power. Loud cries of Oh and<br>Alas were uttered, as also those of Oh and Fie. As regards Drona himself,<br>abandoning his weapons, he was then in a supremely tranquil state. Having<br>said those words he had devoted himself to Yoga. Endued with great<br>effulgence and possessed of high ascetic merit, he had fixed his heart on<br>that Supreme and Ancient Being, viz., Vishnu. Bending his face slightly<br>down, and heaving his breast forward, and closing his eyes, and resting<br>ort the quality of goodness, and disposing his heart to contemplation,<br>and thinking on the monosyllable Om, representing. Brahma, and<br>remembering the puissant, supreme, and indestructible God of gods, the<br>radiant Drona or high ascetic merit, the preceptor (of the Kurus and the<br>Pandavas) repaired to heaven that is so difficult of being attained even<br>by the pious. Indeed, when Drona thus proceeded to heaven it seemed to us<br>that there were then two suns in the firmament. The whole welkin was<br>ablaze and seemed to be one vast expanse of equal light when the sun-like<br>Bharadwaja, of solar effulgence, disappeared. Confused sounds of joy were<br>heard, uttered by the delighted celestials. When Drona thus repaired to<br>the region of Brahman, Dhrishtadyumna stood, unconscious of it all,<br>beside him. Only we five amongst men beheld the high-souled Drona rapt in<br>Yoga proceed to the highest region of blessedness. These five were<br>myself, Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, and Drona's son, Aswatthaman, and<br>Vasudeva of Vrishni's race, and king Yudhishthira the just, the son of<br>Pandu. Nobody else, O king, could see that glory of the wise Drona,<br>devoted to Yoga, while passing out of the world. In fact, all human<br>beings were unconscious of the fact that the preceptor attained to the<br>supreme region of Brahman, a region mysterious to the very gods, and one<br>that is the highest of all. Indeed, none of them could see the preceptor,<br>that chastiser of foes, proceed to the region of Brahman, devoted to Yoga<br>in the company of the foremost of Rishis, his body mangled with arrows<br>and bathed in blood, after he had laid aside his weapons. As regards<br>Prishata's son, though everybody cried fie on him, yet casting his eyes<br>on the lifeless Drona's head, he began to drag it. With his sword, then,<br>he lopped off from his foe's trunk that head,&#8212;his foe remained<br>speechless the while. Having slain Bharadwaja's son. Dhrishtadyumna was<br>filled with great joy, and uttered leonine shouts, whirling his sword. Of<br>a dark complexion, with white locks hanging down to his ears, that old<br>man of five and eighty years of age, used, for thy sake only, to career<br>on the field of battle with the activity of a youth of sixteen. The<br>mighty-armed Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, (before Drona's head was cut<br>off) had said, 'O son of Drupada, bring the preceptor alive, do not slay<br>him. He should not be slain.' Even thus all the troops also had cried<br>out. Arjuna, in particular, melted with pity, had cried out repeatedly.<br>Disregarding, however, the cries of Arjuna as also these of all the<br>kings, Dhrishtadyumna stew Drona, that bull among men, on the terrace of<br>his car. Covered with Drona's blood, Dhrishtadyumna then Jumped from the<br>car down upon the ground. Looking red like the sun, he then seemed to be<br>exceedingly fierce. Thy troops beheld Drona slain even thus in that<br>battle. Then Dhrishtadyumna. that great bowman, O king, threw down that<br>large head of Bharadwaja's son before the warriors of thy army. Thy<br>soldiers, O monarch, beholding the head of Bharadwaja's son, set their<br>hearts on flight and ran away in all directions. Meanwhile Drona,<br>ascending the skies, entered the stellar path. Through the grace of the<br>Rishis Krishna (Dwaipayana), the son of Satyavati, I witnessed, O king,<br>the (true circumstances about the) death of Drona. I beheld that<br>illustrious one proceeding, after he had ascended the sky, like a<br>smokeless brand of blazing splendour. Upon the fall of Drona, the Kurus,<br>the Pandavas and the Srinjayas, all became cheerless and ran away with<br>great speed. The army then broke up. Many had been slain, and many<br>wounded by means of keen shafts. Thy warriors (in particular), upon the<br>fall of Drona, seemed to be deprived of life. Having sustained a defeat,<br>and being inspired with fear about the future, the Kurus regarded<br>themselves deprived of both the worlds. Indeed, they lost all<br>self-control.[255] Searching for the body of Bharadwaja's, son, O<br>monarch, on the field covered with thousands of headless trunks, the<br>kings could not find it. The Pandavas, having gained the victory and<br>great prospects of renown in the future, began to make loud sounds with<br>their arrows and conchs and uttered loud leonine roars. Then Bhimasena, O<br>king, and Dhrishtadyumna, the son of Prishata, were seen in the midst of<br>the (Pandava) host to embrace each other. Addressing the son of Prishata,<br>that scorcher of foes, viz., Bhima said, 'I will again embrace thee, O<br>son of Prishata, as one crowned with victory, when that wretch of a<br>Suta's son shall be slain in battle, as also that other wretch, viz.,<br>Duryodhana.' Having said these words, Bhimasena, the son of Pandu, filled<br>with transports of joy, caused the earth to tremble with slaps on his<br>armpits. Terrified by that sound, thy troops ran away from battle,<br>forgetting the duties of the Kshatriyas and setting their hearts on<br>flight. The Pandavas, having become victors, became very glad, O monarch,<br>and they felt great happiness, derived from the destruction of their foes<br>in battle.'"
