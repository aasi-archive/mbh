                            "Sanjaya said, 'Both Vasudeva and Dhananjaya, afflicted with sorrow and<br>grief and frequently sighing like two snakes, got no sleep that night.<br>Understanding that both Nara and Narayana were in rage, the gods with<br>Vasava became very anxious thinking, 'What will come of it?' Fierce<br>winds, that were again dry and foreboded danger, began to blow. And a<br>headless trunk and a mace appeared on the disc of the sun. And although<br>it was cloudless, frequent thunders were heard, of loud report, mixed<br>with flashes of lightning. The earth with her mountains and waters and<br>forests, shook. The seas, those habitation of Makaras, swelled O king, in<br>agitation. The rivers ran in directions opposite to their usual course.<br>The nether and upper lips of car-warriors and steeds and men and<br>elephants began to tremble. And as if for gladdening the cannibals, on<br>that occasion foreboding a great accession of population to the domain of<br>Yama, the animals (on the field) began to eject urine and excreta, and<br>utter loud cries of woe. Beholding these fierce omens that made the hair<br>stand on end, and hearing also of the fierce vow of the mighty Arjuna,<br>all thy warriors, O bull of Bharata's race became exceedingly agitated.<br>Then the mighty-armed son of Pakasasana said unto Krishna. 'Go, and<br>comfort thy sister Subhadra with her daughter-in-law. And, O Madhava, let<br>also that daughter-in-law, and her companions, be comforted by thee; O<br>lord, comfort them with soothing words that are again fraught with<br>truth.' Thus addressed, Vasudeva, with a cheerless heart, wending to<br>Arjuna's abode, began to comfort his sorrowing sister afflicted with<br>grief on account of the death of her son.'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'O lady of Vrishni's race, do not grieve, with thy<br>daughter-in-law, for thy son. G timid one, all creatures have but one end<br>ordained by Time. The end thy son hath met with-that becometh a hero of<br>proud lineage, especially who is a Kshatriya. Do not, therefore, grieve.<br>By good luck it is that mighty car-warrior of great wisdom, of prowess<br>equal to that of his father, hath, after the Kshatriya custom, met with<br>an end that is coveted by heroes. Having vanquished numberless foes and<br>despatched them unto Yama's presence, he hath himself repaired to those<br>eternal regions, that grant the fruition of every wish, and that are for<br>the righteous. Thy son hath attained that end which the righteous attain<br>by penance, by Brahmacharya, by knowledge of the scriptures, and by<br>wisdom. The mother of a hero, the wife of a hero, the daughter of a hero,<br>and a kinsman of heroes, O amiable one, grieve not thou for thy son who<br>hath obtained the supreme end. The wretched ruler of the Sindhus, O<br>beautiful lady, that murderer of a child, that perpetrator of a sinful<br>act, shall, with his friends and kinsmen, obtain the fruit of this<br>arrogance of his on the expiry of this night. Even if he enters the abode<br>of Indra himself he will not escape from the hands of Partha. Tomorrow<br>thou shalt hear that the head of the Sindhus hath, in battle, been cut<br>off from his trunk to roll on the outskirts of Samantapanchaka! Dispel<br>thy sorrow, and do not grieve. Keeping the duties of a Kshatriya before<br>him, thy brave son hath attained the end of the righteous, that end,<br>viz., which we here expect to obtain as also others that bear arms as a<br>profession. Of broad chest, mighty arms, unreturning, a crusher of<br>car-warriors, thy son, O beautiful lady, hath gone to heaven. Drive away<br>this fever (of thy heart). Obedient to his sires and maternal relations,<br>that heroic and mighty car-warriors of great prowess hath fallen a prey<br>to death, after having slain thousands of foes comfort<br>thy-daughter-in-law, O queen! Do not grieve too much, O Kshatriya lady!<br>Drive away thy grief, O daughter, as thou shalt hear such agreeable news<br>on the morrow. That which Partha hath vowed must be accomplished. It<br>cannot be otherwise. That which is sought to be done by thy husband can<br>never remain unaccomplished. Even if all human beings and snakes and<br>Pisachas and all the wanderers of the night and birds, and all the gods<br>and the Asuras, help the ruler of the Sindhus on the field of battle; he<br>shall still, with them, cease to exist tomorrow.'"
