                            (Drona-vadha Parva)<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Thus addressed by Vyasa, the heroic king Yudhishthira the<br>just refrained, O bull of Bharata's race, from himself seeking to slay<br>Karna. In consequence, however of the slaughter of Ghatotkacha by the<br>Suta's son that night, the king became filled with grief and anger.<br>Beholding thy vast host held in check by Bhima, Yudhishthira, addressing<br>Dhrishtadyumna, said, 'Resist the Pot-born! O scorcher of foes, thou<br>hadst, clad in mail, and armed with bow and arrows and scimitar, sprung<br>from fire, for the destruction of Drona! Cheerfully rush thou to battle,<br>thou needst have no fear. Let also Janamejaya and Sikhandin and<br>Durmukha's son and Yasodhara, rush in wrath against the Pot-born on every<br>side. Let Nakula and Sahadeva and the sons of Draupadi and the<br>Prabhadrakas, and Drupada and Virata with their sons and brothers, and<br>Satyaki and the Kaikeyas and the Pandavas and Dhananjaya, rush with speed<br>against Bharadwaja's son, from desire of slaying him. Let also all our<br>car-warriors and all the elephants and horses we have, and all our<br>foot-soldiers, overthrow the mighty car-warrior Drona in battle.' Thus<br>ordered by the illustrious son of Pandu, all of them rushed impetuously<br>against the Pot-born from desire of slaughtering him. Drona, however,<br>that foremost of all wielders of arms, received in battle all those<br>Pandava warriors thus rushing towards him suddenly with great force and<br>perseverance. The king Duryodhana, desiring to protect Drona's life,<br>rushed, filled with wrath, against the Pandavas, with great force and<br>perseverance. Then commenced the battle between the Kurus and the<br>Pandavas who roared at each other. The animals of both hosts as also the<br>warriors were all tired. The great car-warriors also, O king, with eyes<br>closing in sleep and worn out with exertion in battle, knew not what to<br>do. That night of nine hours, so terrible and awful[242] and so<br>destructive of creatures, appeared to them to be everything.[243] While<br>they were being thus slain and mangled by one another, and while sleep<br>sat heavy on their eyes, it became midnight. All the Kshatriyas became<br>cheerless. Thy troops, as also those of the toe, had no more weapons and<br>arrows. Passing the time thus (most of), the warriors (of both armies)<br>endued with modesty and energy and observant of the duties of their<br>order, din not abandon their divisions. Others, blind with sleep,<br>abandoning their weapons, laid themselves down. Some laid themselves down<br>on the backs of elephants, some on cars, and some on horseback, O<br>Bharata! Blind with sleep, they became perfectly motionless, O king.<br>Other warriors (that were yet awake) in that battle, despatched these to<br>Yama's abode. Others, deprived of their senses, and dreaming in sleep,<br>slew themselves, that is, their own comrades, as also foes. Indeed, these<br>fought in that dreadful battle, uttering various exclamations. Many<br>warriors, O monarch, of our army, desirous of continuing the fight with<br>the foe, stood with eyes drowsy with sleep. Some brave warriors, during<br>that terrible hour of darkness, though blind with sleep, yet gliding<br>along the field, slew one another in that battle. Many amongst the foe,<br>entirely stupefied by slumber, were slain without their being conscious<br>(of the strokes that launched them into eternity). Beholding this<br>condition of the soldiers, O bull among men, Vibhatsu in a very loud<br>voice, said these words: all of you, with your animals, are worn out with<br>exertion and blind with sleep. Ye warriors, ye are enveloped in darkness<br>and with dust. Therefore, if ye like, ye may rest. Indeed, here, on the<br>field of battle close your eyes for a while. Then when the moon will<br>rise, ye Kurus and Pandavas, ye may again, having slept and taken rest,<br>encounter each other for the sake of heaven.' Hearing these words of the<br>virtuous Arjuna, the virtuous warriors (of the Kuru army) assented to the<br>suggestion, and addressing one another, loudly said, 'O Karna, O Karna, O<br>king Duryodhana, abstain from the fight. The Pandava host hath ceased to<br>strike us.' Then at those words of Phalguna, uttered loudly by him, the<br>Pandava army as also thine, O Bharata, abstained from battle. Indeed,<br>these noble words of Partha were highly applauded by the gods, the<br>high-souled Rishis, and all the gladdened soldiers. Applauding those kind<br>words, O Bharata, all the troops, O king, worn out with exertion, laid<br>-themselves down for sleep, O bull of Bharata's race. Then that army of<br>thine, O Bharata, happy at the prospect of rest and sleep, sincerely<br>blessed Arjuna saying, 'In thee are the Vedas as also all weapons! In<br>thee are intelligence and prowess! In thee, O mighty armed one, are<br>righteousness and compassion for all creatures, O sinless one! And since<br>we have been comforted by thee, we wish thy good, O Partha! Let<br>prosperity be to thee! Soon do thou get, O hero, those objects that are<br>dear to thy heart!' Blessing him thus, O tiger among men, those great<br>car-warriors, overcome with sleep, became silent, O monarch! Some laid<br>themselves down on horseback, some on the car-boxes, some on the necks of<br>elephants, and some on the bare ground. Many men, with their weapons and<br>maces and swords and battle axes and lances and with their armours on,<br>laid themselves down for sleep, apart from one another. Elephants, heavy<br>with sleep, made the earth cool with the breath of their nostrils, that<br>passed through their snake-like trunks spotted with dust. Indeed, the<br>elephants, as they breathed on the ground, looked beautiful like hills<br>scattered (on the field of battle) over whose breasts hissed gigantic<br>snakes. Steeds, in trappings of gold and with manes mingling with their<br>yokes, stamping their hoofs made even grounds uneven. Thus every one, O<br>king, slept there with the animal he rode. Thus steeds and elephants and<br>warriors, O bull of Bharata's race, very much worn out with exertion,<br>slept, abstaining from battle. That slumbering host, deprived of sense<br>and sunk in sleep, then looked like a wonderful picture drawn on canvas<br>by skilful artists. Those Kshatriyas, decked in ear-rings and endued with<br>youth, with limbs mangled by shafts, and immersed in sleep, having laid<br>themselves down on the coronal globes of elephants, looked as if they<br>were lying on the deep bosom of beautiful ladies. Then the moon, that<br>delighter of eye and lord of lilies, of hue white as the checks of a.<br>beautiful lady, rose, adorning the direction presided over by Indra.[244]<br>Indeed, like a lion of the Udaya hills, with rays constituting his manes<br>of brilliant yellow, he issued out of his cave in the east, tearing to<br>pieces the thick gloom of night resembling an extensive herd of<br>elephants.[245] That lover of all assemblage of lilies (in the world),<br>bright as the body of Mahadeva's excellent bull, full-arched and radiant<br>as Karna's bow, and delightful and charming as the smile on the lips of a<br>bashful bride, bloomed in the firmament.[246] Soon, however, that divine<br>lord having the hare for his mark showed himself shedding brighter rays<br>around. Indeed, the moon, after this seemed to gradually emit a bright<br>halo of far-reaching light that resembled the splendour of gold. Then the<br>rays of that luminary, dispelling the darkness by their splendour, slowly<br>spread themselves over all the quarters, the welkin, and the earth. Soon,<br>therefore, the world became illuminated. The unspeakable darkness that<br>had hidden everything quickly fled away. When the world was thus<br>illuminated into almost daylight by the moon, amongst the creatures that<br>wander at night, some continued to roam about and some abstained. That<br>host, O king, awakened by the rays of the sun. Indeed, that sea of troops<br>was awakened by the rays of the moon bloomed (into life) like an<br>assemblage of lotuses expanded by the rays of the sun. Indeed, that sea<br>of troops was awakened by the risen moon like the ocean swelling up in<br>agitated surges at the rise of that luminary. Then, O king, the battle<br>once more commenced on earth, for the destruction of the earth's<br>population, between men that desired to attain to heaven.'"
