                            "Sanjaya said, 'While Yudhishthira, Vasudeva, and others were thus<br>conversing, Dhananjaya came there, desirous of beholding that foremost<br>one of Bharata's race, viz., the king, as also his friends and<br>well-wishers. After he had entered that auspicious chamber and having<br>saluted him duly, had taken its stand before the king, that bull among<br>the Pandavas, (viz., king Yudhishthira), rising up from his seat,<br>embraced Arjuna with great affection. Smelling his head and embracing him<br>with his arms, the king blessed him heartily. And addressing him<br>smilingly, he said, 'It is evident, O Arjuna, that complete victory<br>certainly awaits thee in battle, judging from thy countenance (bright and<br>cheerful as it is), and by the fact that Janardana is well-pleased with<br>thee. Then Jishnu related unto him that highly wonderful incident,<br>saying, 'Blessed be thou, O monarch, I have, through Kesava's grace,<br>beheld something exceedingly wonderful.' Then Dhananjaya related<br>everything he had seen, about his meeting with the Three-eyed god, for<br>assuring his friends. Then all the hearers, filled with wonder, bent<br>their heads to the ground. And bowing unto the god having the bull for<br>his mark, they said, 'Excellent, Excellent!' Then all the friends and<br>well-wishers (of the Pandavas), commanded by the son of Dharma, quickly<br>and carefully proceeded to battle, their hearts filled with rage (against<br>the foe). Saluting the king, Yuyudhana and Kesava and Arjuna, cheerfully<br>set out from Yudhishthira's abode. And those two invincible warriors,<br>those two heroes, viz., Yuyudhana, and Janardana, together proceeded on<br>the same car to Arjuna's pavilion. Arrived there, Hrishikesa, like a<br>charioteer (by profession), began to equip that car bearing the mark of<br>the prince of apes and belonging to that foremost of car-warriors (viz.,<br>Arjuna). And that foremost of cars, of the effulgence of heated gold, and<br>of rattle resembling the deep roar of the clouds, equipped (by Krishna),<br>shone brightly like the morning sun. Then that tiger among men, (viz.,<br>Vasudeva), clad in mail informed Partha, who had finished his morning<br>prayers, of the fact that 'his car had been properly equipped. Then that<br>foremost of men in this world, viz., the diadem-decked (Arjuna), clad in<br>golden armour, with his bow and arrows in hand, circumambulated that car.<br>And adored and blessed with benedictions about victory by Brahmanas, old<br>in ascetic penances and knowledge and years, ever engaged in the<br>performance of religious rites and sacrifices, and having their passions<br>under control, Arjuna then ascended that great car, that excellent<br>vehicle, which had previously been sanctified with mantras capable of<br>giving victory in battle, like Surya of blazing rays ascending the<br>eastern mountain. And that foremost of car-warriors decked with gold, in<br>consequence or those golden ornaments of his, on his car like Surya of<br>blazing splendour on the breast of Meru. After Partha, Yuyudhana. and<br>Janardana mounted on that car, like the twin Aswins riding the same car<br>with Indra while coming to the sacrifice of Saryati. Then Govinda, that<br>foremost of charioteers, took the reins (of the steeds), like Matali<br>taking the reins of Indra's steeds, while the latter went to battle for<br>slaying Vritra.[133] Mounted on that best of cars with those two friends,<br>that slayer of large bodies of foes, viz., Partha, proceeded for<br>achieving the slaughter of the ruler of the Sindhus, like Soma rising (in<br>the firmament) with Budha and Sukra, for destroying the gloom of night,<br>or like Indra proceeding with Varuna and Surya to the great battle (with<br>the Asuras) occasioned by the abduction of Taraka (the wife of<br>Vrihaspati). The bards and musicians gratified the heroic Arjuna, as he<br>proceeded, with the sound of musical instruments and auspicious hymns of<br>good omen. And the voices of the panegyrists and the bards uttering<br>benedictions of victory and wishing good day, mingling with the sounds of<br>musical instruments, became gratifying to those heroes. And an auspicious<br>breeze, fraught with fragrance, blew from behind Partha, gladdening him<br>and sucking up the energies of his foes. And at that hour, O king, many<br>auspicious omens of various kinds appeared to view, indicating victory to<br>the Pandavas and defeat to thy warriors, O sire! Beholding those<br>indications of victory, Arjuna, addressing the great bowman Yuyudhana on<br>his right, said these words: O Yuyudhana! in today's battle my victory<br>seems to be certain, since O bull of Sini's race, all these (auspicious)<br>omens are seen. I shall, therefore, go thither where the ruler of the<br>Sindhus waiteth for (the display of) my energy and in expectation of<br>repairing to the regions of Yama. Indeed, as the slaughter of the ruler<br>of the Sindhus is one of my most imperative duties, even so is the<br>protection of king Yudhishthira the just another of my most imperative<br>obligations. O thou of mighty arms, be thou today the king's protector.<br>Thou wilt protect him even as I myself protect him. I do not behold the<br>person in the world who would be able to vanquish thee. Thou art, in<br>battle, equal to Vasudeva himself. The chief of the celestials himself is<br>unable to vanquish thee. Reposing this burden on thee, or on that mighty<br>car-warrior Pradyumna, I can, O bull among men, without anxiety slay the<br>ruler of the Sindhus. O thou of the Satwata race, no anxiety need be<br>entertained on my account. With thy whole heart must thou protect the<br>king. There where the mighty-armed Vasudeva stayeth, and where I myself<br>stay, without doubt, the slightest danger to him or me can never befall.'<br>Thus addressed by Partha, Satyaki, that slayer of hostile heroes, replied<br>saying, 'So be it.' And then the latter proceeded to the spot where king<br>Yudhishthira was.'
