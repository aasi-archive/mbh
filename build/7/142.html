                            "Sanjaya said, 'That arm (of Bhurisravas) decked with Angada and the<br>sword in its grasp (thus cut off), fell down on the earth to the great<br>grief of all living creatures. Indeed, that arm, which was to have cut<br>off Satyaki's head itself, cut off by the unseen Arjuna, quickly dropped<br>down on the earth, like a snake of five heads. The Kuru warrior,<br>beholding himself incapacitated by Partha abandoned his hold on Satyaki<br>and wrathfully reproved the son of Pandu.'<br><br>"Bhurisravas said, 'Thou hast, O son of Kunti, done a cruel and heartless<br>deed, since without being engaged with me, thou hast, unseen by me, cut<br>off my arm. Shalt thou not have to say unto Yudhishthira, the royal son<br>of Dharma, even this, viz., 'Bhurisravas, while otherwise engaged, was<br>slain by me in battle?' Wert thou taught this use of weapons by the<br>high-souled Indra or by Rudra, O Partha, or by Drona, or by Kripa? Thou<br>art, in this world, better acquainted with the rules about the use of<br>weapons than all others. Why then hast thou cut off in battle the arm of<br>a warrior who was not engaged with thee? The righteous never strike him<br>that is heedless, or him that is terrified, or him that is made carless,<br>or him that beggeth for life or protection, of him that hath fallen into<br>distress. Why, then, O Partha, hast thou perpetrated such an extremely<br>unworthy deed that is sinful, that is worthy only of a low wretch, and<br>that is practised by only a wicked bloke! A respectable person, O<br>Dhananjaya, can easily accomplish a deed that is respectable. A deed,<br>however, that is disrespectable becomes difficult of accomplishment by a<br>person that is respectable. A man quickly catches the behaviour of those<br>with whom and amongst whom he moves. This is seen in thee, O Partha!<br>Being of royal lineage and born, especially, in Kuru's race, how hast<br>thou fallen off from the duties of a Kshatriya, although thou wert of<br>good behaviour and observant of excellent vows. This mean act that thou<br>hast perpetrated for the sake of the Vrishni warrior, is without doubt,<br>conformable to Vasudeva's counsels. Such an act does not suit one like<br>thee. Who else, unless he were a friend of Krishna's, would inflict such<br>a wrong upon lone that is heedlessly engaged with another in battle? The<br>Vrishnis and the Andhakas are bad Kshatriyas, ever engaged in sinful<br>deeds, and are, by nature, addicted to disreputable behaviour. Why, O<br>Partha, hast thou taken them as model? Thus addressed in battle, Partha<br>replied unto Bhurisravas, saying, 'It is evident that with the<br>decrepitude of the body one's intellect also becomes decrepit, since, O<br>lord, all those senseless words have been uttered by thee. Although thou<br>knowest Hrishikesa and myself well, how is it that thou rebukest us thus?<br>Knowing as I do the rules of battle and conversant as I am with the<br>meaning of all the scriptures, I would never do an act that is sinful.<br>Knowing this well, thou rebukest me yet. The Kshatriyas fight with their<br>foes, surrounded by their own followers, their brothers, sires, sons,<br>relatives, kinsmen, companions, and friends. These also fight, relying on<br>the (strength of) arms of those they follow. Why, then, should I not<br>protect Satyaki, my disciple and dear kinsman, who is fighting for our<br>sake in this battle, regardless of life itself, that is so difficult of<br>being laid down.[169] Invincible in fight, Satyaki, O king, is my right<br>arm in battle. One should not protect one's own self only, when one goes<br>to battle, he, O king, who is engaged in the business of another should<br>be protected (by that other). Such men being protected, the king is<br>protected in press of battle. If I had calmly beheld Satyaki on the point<br>of being slain in great battle (and had not interfered for saying him),<br>sin would, then, owing to Satyaki's death, have been mine, for such<br>negligence! Why then dost thou become angry with me for my having<br>protected Satyaki? Thou rebukest me, O king, saying, 'Though engaged with<br>another, I have yet been maimed by thee.' In that matter, I answer, I<br>judged wrongly. Sometimes shaking my armour; sometimes riding on my car,<br>sometimes drawing the bow-string, I was fighting with my enemies in the<br>midst of a host resembling the vast deep, teeming with cars and elephants<br>and abounding with steeds and foot-soldiers and echoing with fierce<br>leonine shouts. Amongst friends and foes engaged with one another, how<br>could it be possible that the Satwata warrior was engaged with only one<br>person in battle? Having fought with many and vanquished many mighty<br>car-warriors, Satyaki had been tired. He himself, afflicted with weapons,<br>had become cheerless. Having, under such circumstances, vanquished the<br>mighty car-warrior, Satyaki, and brought him under thy control, thou<br>soughtest to display thy superiority. Thou. hadst desired to cut off,<br>with thy sword, the head of Satyaki in battle. I could not possibly<br>behold with indifference Satyaki reduced to that strait.[170] Thou<br>shouldst rather rebuke thy own self, since thou didst not take care of<br>thyself (when seeking to injure another). Indeed, O hero, how wouldst<br>thou have behaved towards one who is thy dependant?'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus addressed (by Arjuna), the mighty-armed and<br>illustrious Bhurisravas, bearing the device of the sacrificial stake on<br>his banner, abandoning Yuyudhana, desired to die according to the vow of<br>Praya.[171] Distinguished by many righteous deeds, he spread with his<br>left hand a bed of arrows, and desirous of proceeding to the region of<br>Brahman, committed his senses to the care of the deities presiding over<br>them. Fixing his gaze on the sun, and setting his cleansed heart on the<br>moon, and thinking of (the mantras in) the great Upanishad, Bhurisravas,<br>betaking himself to Yoga, ceased to speak. Then all the persons in the<br>entire army began to speak ill of Krishna and Dhananjaya and applauded<br>Bhurisravas, that bull among men. Though censured, the two Krishnas,<br>however, spoke not a word disagreeable (to the dying hero). The<br>stake-bannered Bhurisravas also, though thus applauded, felt no joy. Then<br>Pandu's son Dhanajaya, called also Phalguna, incapable of bearing thy<br>sons speaking in that strain, as also of putting up with their words and<br>the words of Bhurisravas, O Bharata, in grief and without an angry heart,<br>and as if for reminding them all, said these words, 'All the kings are<br>acquainted with my great vow, viz., that no one shall succeed in slaying<br>anybody that belongs to our side, as long as the latter is within the<br>range of my shafts. Remembering this, O stake-bannered one, it behoveth<br>thee not to censure me. Without knowing rules of morality, it is not<br>proper for one to censure others. That I have cut off thy arm while thou,<br>well-armed in battle, wert on the point of slaying (the unarmed) Satyaki,<br>is not all contrary to morality. But what righteous man is there, O sire,<br>that would applaud the slaughter of Abhimanyu, a mere child, without<br>arms, deprived of car, and his armour fallen off?' Thus addressed by<br>Partha, Bhurisravas touched the ground with his left arm the right one<br>(that had been lopped off). The stake-bannered Bhurisravas, O king of<br>dazzling effulgence, having heard those words of Partha, remained silent,<br>with his head hanging down. Then Arjuna said, 'O eldest brother of Sala,<br>equal to what I bear to king Yudhishthira the Just, or Bhima, that<br>foremost of all mighty persons, or Nakula, or Sahadeva, is the love I<br>bear to thee. Commanded by me as also by the illustrious Krishna, repair<br>thou to the region of the righteous, even where Sivi, the son of Usinara,<br>is.'<br><br>"Vasudeva also said, 'Thou hast constantly performed sacrifices and<br>Agnihotras. Go thou then, without delay, into those pure, regions of mine<br>that incessantly blaze forth with splendour and that are desired by the<br>foremost of deities with Brahma as their head, and becoming equal to<br>myself, be thou borne on the back to Garuda.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Set free by Somadatta's son, the grandson of Sini,<br>rising up, drew his sword and desired to cut off the head of the<br>high-souled Bhurisravas. Indeed, Satyaki desired to slay the sinless<br>Bhurisravas, the eldest brother of Sala, that giver of plenty in<br>sacrifices who was staying with his, senses withdrawn from battle, who<br>had already been almost slain by the son of Pandu, who was sitting with<br>his arm lopped off and who resembled on that account a trunkless<br>elephant. All the warriors loudly censured him (for his intention). But<br>deprived of reason, and forbidden by Krishna and the high-souled Partha,<br>Bhima, and the two protectors of the two wheels (of Arjuna's car, viz.,<br>Yudhamanyu and Uttamaujas), and Aswatthaman, and Kripa and Karna, and<br>Vrishasena, and the ruler of the Sindhus also, and while the soldiers<br>were yet uttering shouts of disapproval, Satyaki stew Bhurisravas while<br>in the observance of his vow. Indeed, Satyaki, with his sword, cut off<br>the head of the Kuru warrior who had been deprived of his arm by Partha<br>and who was then sitting in Praya for freeing his soul from the body. The<br>warriors did not applaud Satyaki for that act of his in slaying that<br>perpetuator of Kuru's race who had before been almost slain by Partha.<br>The Siddhas, the Charanas, and the men there present, as also the gods,<br>beholding the Sakra-like Bhurisravas slain in that battle, through<br>sitting in the observance of that Praya vow, began to applaud him, amazed<br>at the acts, accomplished by him. Thy soldiers also argued the matter,<br>'It is no fault of the Vrishni hero. That which was pre-ordained has<br>happened. Therefore, we should not give way to wrath. Anger is the cause<br>of men's sorrow. It was ordained that Bhurisravas would be slain by the<br>Vrishni hero. There is no use of judging of its propriety or otherwise.<br>The Creator had ordained Satyaki to be the cause of Bhurisrava's death in<br>battle.'<br><br>"Satyaki said, 'Ye sinful Kauravas, wearing the outward garment of<br>righteousness, ye tell me, in words of virtue, that Bhurisravas should<br>not be slain. Where, however, did this righteousness of yours go when ye<br>slew in battle that child, viz., the son of Subhadra, while destitute of<br>arms? I had in a certain fit of haughtiness vowed that he who would,<br>throwing me down alive in battle, strike me with his foot in rage, he<br>would be slain by me even though that foe should adopt the vow of<br>asceticism. Struggling in the encounter, with my arms and eyes hale and<br>sound, ye had yet regarded me as dead. This was an act of folly on our<br>part. Ye bulls among the Kurus, the slaughter of Bhurisravas,<br>accomplished by me, hath been very proper! Partha, however, by cutting<br>off this one's arm with sword in grasp for fulfilling, from his affection<br>for me, his own vow (about protecting all on his side), hath simply<br>robbed me of glory. That which is ordained must happen. It is destiny<br>that works. Bhurisravas hath been slain in press of battle. What sin have<br>I perpetrated? In days of yore, Valmiki sang this verse on earth, viz.,<br>'Thou sayest, O ape, that women should not be slain. In all ages,<br>however, men should always, with resolute care, accomplish that which<br>gives pain to enemies.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, After Satyaki had said these words, none amongst the<br>Pandavas and the Kauravas, O king, said anything. On the other hand, they<br>mentally applauded Bhurisravas. No one there applauded the slaughter of<br>Somadatta's illustrious son who resembled an ascetic living in the woods,<br>or one sanctified with mantras in a great sacrifice, and who had given<br>away thousands of gold coins. The head of that hero, graced with<br>beautiful blue locks and eyes, red as those of pigeons, looked like the<br>head of a horse cut off in a Horse-sacrifice and placed on the<br>sacrificial altar.[172] Sanctified by his prowess and the death he<br>obtained at the edge of the weapon, the boon-giving Bhurisravas, worthy<br>of every boon, casting off his body in great battle, repaired to regions<br>on high, filling the welkin with his high virtues.'"
