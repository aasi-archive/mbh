                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Tell me, O Sanjaya, the distinctive indications of<br>the cars of all those who, excited with wrath and headed by Bhimasena,<br>had proceeded against Drona.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Beholding Vrikodara advancing (on a car drawn) by steeds<br>of dappled hue (like: that of the antelope), the brave grandson of Sini<br>(Satyaki) proceeded, borne by steeds of a silvery hue. The irresistible<br>Yudhamanyu, excited with rage, proceeded against Drona, borne by<br>excellent steeds of variegated hue. Dhristadyumna, the son of the<br>Panchala king, proceeded, borne by steeds of great fleetness in trappings<br>of gold and of the hue of pigeons.[43] Desirous of protecting his sire,<br>and wishing him complete success, Dhristadyumna's son, Kshatradharman of<br>regulated vows, proceeded., borne by red steeds. Kshatradeva, the son of<br>Sikhandin, himself urging well-decked steeds of the hue of lotus-leaves<br>and with eyes of pure white, proceeded (against Drona). Beautiful steeds<br>of the Kamvoja breed, decked with the feathers of the green parrot,<br>bearing Nakula, quickly ran towards thy army. Dark steeds of the clouds<br>wrathfully bore Uttamaujas, O Bharata, to battle, against the invincible<br>Drona, standing with arrows aimed. Steeds, fleet as the wind, and of<br>variegated hue, bore Sahadeva with upraised weapons to that fierce<br>battle. Of great impetuosity, and possessed of the fleetness of the wind,<br>steeds of the ivory hue and having black manes on the neck, bore<br>Yudhishthira, that tiger among men. And many warriors followed<br>Yudhishthira, borne on their steeds, decked in trappings of gold and all<br>fleet as the wind. Behind the king was the royal chief of the Panchalas,<br>viz., Drupada, with a golden umbrella over his head and himself protected<br>by all those soldiers (that followed Yudhishthira). That great bowman<br>among all the kings, viz., Sautabhi, proceeded, borne by beautiful steeds<br>capable of bearing every noise. Accompanied by all the great<br>car-warriors, Virata quickly followed the former. The Kaikeyas and<br>Sikhandin, and Dhrishtaketu, surrounded by their respective troops,<br>followed the ruler of Matsyas. Excellent steeds of the (pale red) hue of<br>trumpet-flowers, looked exceedingly beautiful as they bore Virata. Fleet<br>steeds of yellow colour and decked in chains of gold, bore with great<br>speed the son (Uttara) of that slayer of foes, viz., Virata, the royal<br>chief of the Matsyas. The five Kekaya brothers were borne by steeds of<br>deep red hue. Of the splendour of gold and owning standards of the red<br>hue, and decked with chains of gold, all of them heroes, accomplished in<br>battle, they proceeded, clad in mail, and showering arrows like the very<br>clouds. Excellent steeds, the gift of Tumvuru, of the hue of unbaked<br>earthen pots, bore Sikhandin, the Panchala prince of immeasurable energy.<br>Altogether, twelve thousand mighty car-warriors of the Panchala race<br>proceeded to battle. Of these, six thousand followed Sikhandin. Sportive<br>steeds, O sire, of the dappled hue of the antelope, bore the son of<br>Sisupal, that tiger among men. That bull among the Chedis, viz.,<br>Dhrishtaketu, endued with great strength, and difficult of being<br>vanquished in battle, proceeded, borne by Kamvoja steeds of variegated<br>hue. Excellent steeds of the Sindhu breed, of beautiful limbs, and of the<br>hue of the smoke of straw, quickly bore the Kaikeya prince,<br>Vrihatkshatra. Possessed of eyes of pure white, of the hue of the lotus,<br>born in the country of the Valhikas, and decked with ornaments, bore<br>Sikhandin's son, the brave Kshatradeva.[44] Decked in trappings of gold,<br>and possessed of the hue of red silk, quiet steeds bore Senavindu, that<br>chastiser of foes, to battle. Excellent steeds of the hue of cranes, bore<br>to battle the youthful and delicate son of the king of the Kasis, that<br>mighty car-warrior. White steeds with black necks, endued with the speed<br>of the mind, O monarch, and exceedingly obedient to the driver, bore<br>prince Prativindhya. Whitish yellow steeds bore Sutasoma, the son of<br>Arjuna, whom the latter had obtained from Soma himself. He was born in<br>the Kuru city known by the name of Udayendu. Endued with effulgence of a<br>thousand moons, and because he also had won great renown in an assembly<br>of the Somakas, he came to be called Sutasoma. Steeds of the hue of Sala<br>flowers or of morning sun bore Nakula's son Satanika worthy of every<br>praise. Steeds decked in trappings of gold, and endued with the hue of<br>the peacock's neck, bore that tiger among men, Srutakarman, the son of<br>Draupdi (by Bhima). Excellent steeds of the hue of the king-fishers bore<br>Draupadi's son Srutkirti to that battle, who like Partha was an ocean of<br>learning. Steeds of a tawny hue bore the youthful Abhimanyu who was<br>regarded as superior to Krishna or Partha one and a half times in battle.<br>Gigantic steeds bore Yuyutsu to battle, that only warrior amongst the<br>sons of Dhritarashtra who (abandoning his brothers) hath sided with the<br>Pandavas. Plump and well-decked steeds of the hue of the (dried) paddy<br>stalk bore Vardhakshemi of great activity to that dreadful battle. Steeds<br>with black legs, equipped in breast-plates of gold, and exceedingly<br>obedient to the driver, bore youthful Sauchitti to battle. Steeds whose<br>backs were covered with golden armour, decked with chains of gold,<br>well-broken, and of the hue of red silk, bore Srenimat. Steeds of a red<br>hue bore the advancing Satyadhriti accomplished in the science of arms<br>and in the divine Vedas. That Panchala who was commander (of the Pandava<br>army) and who took Drona as the victim allotted to his share,&#8212;that<br>Dhrishtadyumna,&#8212;was borne by steeds of the hue of pigeons. Him followed<br>Satyadhriti, and Sauchitti irresistible in battle, and Srenimat, and<br>Vasudana, and Vibhu, the son of the ruler of the Kasis. These had fleet<br>steeds of the best Kamvoja breed decked with chains of gold. Each<br>resembling Yama or Vaisravana, they proceeded to battle, striking fear<br>into the hearts of the hostile soldiers. The Prabhadrakas of the Kamvoja<br>country, numbering six thousand, with upraised weapons, with excellent<br>steeds of diverse hues on their gold-decked cars, with stretched bows and<br>making their foes tremble with their showers of arrows and resolved to<br>die together,[45] followed Dhristadyumna. Excellent steeds of the hue of<br>tawny silk, decked with beautiful chains of gold, cheerfully bore<br>Chekitana. Arjuna's maternal uncle Purujit, otherwise called Kuntibhoja,<br>came borne by excellent steeds of the colour of the rainbow. Steeds of<br>the colour of star-bespangled firmament bore to battle king Rochamana.<br>Steeds of the hue of the red deer, with white streaks over their bodies,<br>bore the Panchala prince Singhasena, the son of Gopati. That tiger among<br>the Panchalas who is known by the name of Janamejaya, had excellent<br>steeds of the hue of mustard flowers. Fleet, gigantic and dark blue<br>steeds decked with chains of gold, with backs of the hue of curd and<br>faces of the hue of the moon, bore with great speed the ruler of the<br>Panchalas. Brave steeds with beautiful heads, (white) as the stalks of<br>reeds, and a splendour resembling that of the firmament or the lotus,<br>bore Dandadhara. Light brown steeds with backs of the hue of the mouse,<br>and with necks proudly drawn up, bore Vyaghradatta to battle.<br>Dark-spotted steeds bore that tiger among men, viz., Sudhanwan, the<br>prince of Panchala. Of fierce impetuosity resembling that of Indra's<br>thunder, beautiful steeds of the hue of Indragopakas, with variegated<br>patches, bore Chitrayudha. Decked with golden chains, steeds whose<br>bellies were of the hue of the Chakravaka bore Sukshatra, the son of the<br>ruler of the Kosalas. Beautiful and tall steeds of variegated hue and<br>gigantic bodies, exceedingly docile, and decked with chains of gold, bore<br>Satyadhriti accomplished in battle. Sukla advanced to battle with his<br>standard and armour and bow and steeds all of the same white hue. Steeds<br>born on the sea-coast and white as the moon, bore Chandrasena of fierce<br>energy, the son of Samudrasena. Steeds of the hue of the blue lotus and<br>decked with ornaments of gold and adorned with beautiful floral wreaths,<br>bore Saiva owning a beautiful car to battle. Superior steeds of the hue<br>of Kalaya flowers, with white and red streaks, bore Rathasena difficult<br>of being resisted in battle. White steeds bore that king who slew the<br>Patachcharas and who is regarded as the bravest of men. Superior steeds<br>of the hue of Kinsuka flowers bore Chitrayudha decked with beautiful<br>garlands and owning beautiful armour and weapons and standard. King Nila<br>advanced to battle, with standard and armour and bow and banner and<br>steeds all of the same blue colour. Chitra advanced to battle with<br>car-fence and standard and bow all decked with diverse kinds of gems, and<br>beautiful steeds and banner. Excellent steeds of the hue of the lotus<br>bore Hemavarna, the son of Rochamana. Chargers, capable of bearing all<br>kinds of weapons, of brave achievements in battle, possessed of vertebral<br>columns of the hue of reeds, having white testicles, and endued with the<br>colour of the hen's egg, bore Dandaketu. The mighty Sarangadhwaja, endued<br>with wealth of energy, the king of the Pandyas, on steeds of the hue of<br>the moon's rays and decked with armour set with stones of lapis lazuli,<br>advanced upon Drona, stretching his excellent bow. His country having<br>been invaded and his kinsmen having fled, his father had been slain by<br>Krishna in battle. Obtaining weapons then from Bhishma and Drona, Rama<br>and Kripa, prince Sarangadhwaja became, in weapons, the equal of Rukmi<br>and Karna and Arjuna and Achyuta. He then desired to destroy the city of<br>Dwaraka and subjugate the whole world. Wise friends, however, from desire<br>of doing him good, counselled him against that course. Giving up all<br>thoughts of revenge, he is now ruling his own dominions. Steeds that were<br>all of the hue of the Atrusa flower bore a hundred and forty thousand<br>principle car-warriors that followed that Sarangadhwaja, the king of the<br>Pandyas. Steeds of diverse hues and diverse kinds of forces, bore the<br>heroic Ghatotkacha. Mighty steeds of gigantic size, of the Aratta breed,<br>bore the mighty-armed Vrihanta of red eyes mounted on his golden car,<br>that prince, viz., who, rejecting the opinions of all the Bharatas, hath<br>singly, from his reverence for Yudhishthira. gone over to him, abandoning<br>all his cherished desire.[46] Superior steeds of the hue of gold,<br>followed that foremost of kings viz., the virtuous Yudhishthira at his<br>back. Large number of Prabhadrakas, of celestial shapes, advanced to<br>battle, with steeds of diverse excellent colours. All of them owning<br>standards of gold and prepared to struggle vigorously, proceeded with<br>Bhimasena, and wore the aspect, O monarch, of the denizens of heaven with<br>Indra at their head. That assembled host of Prabhadrakas was much liked<br>by Dhristadyumna.'<br><br>"Bharadwaja's son, however, O monarch, surpassed all the warriors in<br>splendour. His standard, with a black deer-skin waving on its top and the<br>beautiful water-pot, O monarch, that it bore, looked exceedingly<br>beautiful. And Bhimasena's standard, bearing the device of a gigantic<br>lion in silver with its eyes made of lapis lazuli, looked exceedingly<br>resplendent. The standard of Yudhishthira of great energy, bearing the<br>device of a golden moon with planets around it, looked very beautiful.<br>Two large and beautiful kettle-drums, called Nanda and Upananda, were<br>tied to it. Played upon by machinery, these produced excellent music that<br>enhanced the delight of all who heard it. For terrifying the foe, we<br>beheld that tall and fierce standard of Nakula, placed on his car bearing<br>the device of a Sarabha with its back made of gold. A beautiful silver<br>swan with bells and banner terrible to look at and enhancing the grief of<br>the foe, was seen on Sahadeva's standard. The standards of the five sons<br>of Draupadi bore on them the excellent images of Dharma, Marut, Sakra,<br>and the twin Aswins. On the car, O king, of the youthful Abhimanyu was an<br>excellent standard that bore a golden peacock, which was bright as heated<br>gold. On Ghatotkacha's standard, O king, a vulture shone brightly, and<br>his steeds also were capable of going everywhere at will, like those of<br>Ravana in days of yore. In Yudhishthira's hands was the celestial bow<br>called Mahendra; and in the hands of Bhimasena, O king, was the celestial<br>bow called Vayavya. For the protection of the three worlds Brahman<br>created a bow. That celestial and indestructible bow was held by<br>Phalguni. The Vaishnava bow was held by Nakula, and the bow called Aswina<br>was held by Sahadeva. That celestial and terrible bow called the<br>Paulastya, was held by Ghatotkacha. The five jewels of bows born by the<br>five sons of Draupadi were the Raudra, the Agneya, the Kauverya, the<br>Yamya, and the Girisa. That excellent and best of bows, called the<br>Raudra, which Rohini's son (Valadeva) had obtained, the latter gave unto<br>the high-souled son of Subhadra, having been gratified with him. These<br>and many other standards decked with gold, were seen there, belonging to<br>brave warriors, all of which enhanced the fear of their foes. The host<br>commanded by Drona, which numbered not a single coward, and in which<br>countless standards rising together seemed to obstruct the welkin, then<br>looked, O monarch, like images on a canvas. We heard the names and<br>lineage, O king, of brave warriors rushing towards Drona in that battle<br>like to what is heard, O monarch, at a self-choice.[47]<br><br>"Then royal Drupada advanced against him at the head of a mighty<br>division. The encounter between those two old men at the heads of their<br>respective forces became terrible like that between two mighty leaders,<br>with rent temples, of two elephantine herds. Vinda and Anuvinda of<br>Avanti, with their troops encountered Virata, the ruler of Matsyas at the<br>head of his forces, like Indra and Agni in days of old encountering the<br>(Asura) Vali. That awful encounter between the Matsyas and the Kekayas,<br>in which steeds and car-warriors and elephants fought most fearlessly,<br>resembled that between the gods and the Asuras in days of old.<br>Bhutakarman, otherwise called Sabhapati, kept away from Drona. Nakula's<br>son Satanika, as the latter advanced, scattering showers of arrows. Then<br>the heir of Nakula, with three broad-headed shafts of great sharpness,<br>deprived Bhutakarman of both his arms and head in that battle. Vivinsati<br>resisted the heroic Sutasoma of great prowess, as the latter advanced<br>towards Drona, scattering showers of arrows. Sutasoma, however, excited<br>with wrath, pierced his uncle Vivinsati with straight arrows, and cased<br>in mail, stood ready for the combat. Bhimaratha, (brother of Duryodhana),<br>with six sharp shafts of great swiftness and made wholly of iron,<br>despatched Salwa along with his steeds and charioteer to Yama's abode.<br>Chitrasena's son, O king, opposed thy (grand) son Srutakarman as the<br>latter came, borne by steeds, looking like peacocks. Those two grandsons<br>of thine, both difficult of being vanquished in battle, and each desirous<br>of slaying the other, fought vigorously for the success of the objects of<br>their respective sires. Beholding Prativindhya staying at the van of that<br>dreadful battle, Drona's son (Aswatthaman), desirous of protecting the<br>honour of his sire, resisted the former with his shafts. Prativindhya,<br>then, excited with rage pierced Aswatthaman, bearing on his standard the<br>device of a lion's tail and staying in battle for the sake of his father,<br>with many sharp shafts. The (eldest) son of Draupadi then scattered over<br>Drona's son showers of arrows, like a sower, O bull among men, scattering<br>seeds on the soil at the sowing season.[48] The son of Duhsasana resisted<br>the mighty car-warrior Srutakirti, the son of Arjuna by Draupadi, as the<br>latter was rushing towards Drona. That son of Arjuna, however, who was<br>equal to Arjuna himself, cutting off the former's bow and standard and<br>charioteer with three broad-headed arrows of great sharpness, proceeded<br>against Drona. Duryodhana's son, Lakshmana, resisted the slayer of the<br>Patachcharas,&#8212;him, that is, O king, who is regarded by both the armies<br>as the bravest of the brave. The latter, however, cutting off both the<br>bow and the standard of Lakshmana, and showering upon him many arrows,<br>flared up with splendour. The youthful Vikarna of great wisdom resisted<br>Sikhandin, the youthful son of Yajnasena, as the latter advanced in that<br>battle. Yajnasena's son then covered the former with showers of arrows.<br>The mighty son Vikarna, baffling those arrowy showers, looked resplendent<br>on the field of battle. Angada resisted with showers of arrows the heroic<br>Uttamaujas in that battle as the latter rushed towards Drona. That<br>encounter between those two lions among men became frightful, and it<br>filled both them and the troops with great zeal. The great bowman<br>Durmukha, endued with great might, resisted with his shafts the heroic<br>Purujit as the latter proceeded towards Drona. Furujit struck Durmukha<br>between his eye-brows with a long shaft. Thereupon, Durmukha's face<br>looked beautiful like a lotus with its stalk. Karna resisted with showers<br>of arrows the five Kekaya brothers, owning red standards, as they<br>proceeded towards Drona. Scorched with the arrowy showers of Karna, those<br>five brothers covered Karna with their arrows. Karna, in return,<br>repeatedly covered them with showers of arrows. Covered with arrows,<br>neither Karna nor the five brother could be seen with their steeds,<br>charioteers, standards, and cars. Thy sons, Durjaya, Jaya, and Vijaya,<br>resisted Nila, and the ruler of the Kasis, and Jayatsena, three against.<br>And the combat between those warriors deepened and gladdened the hearts<br>of the spectators like those between a lion, a tiger, and a wolf on the<br>one side and a bear, a buffalo, and a bull on the other. The brothers<br>Kshemadhurti and Vrihanta mangled Satyaki of the Satwata race with their<br>keen arrows, as the latter proceeded against Drona. The battle between<br>those two on one side and Satyaki on the other became exceedingly<br>wonderful to behold, like that between a lion and two mighty elephants<br>with rent temples in the forest. The king of the Chedis, excited with<br>wrath, and shooting many warriors, kept away from Drona, king Amvashtha,<br>that hero who always delighted, in battle. Then king Amvashtha pierced<br>his antagonist with a long arrow capable of penetrating into the very<br>bones. Thereupon, the latter, with bow and arrow loosened from his grasp,<br>fell down from his car on the ground. The noble Kripa, son of Saradwata,<br>with many small arrows resisted Vardhakshemi of the Vrishni race who was<br>the embodiment of wrath (in battle). They that looked at Kripa, son of<br>Saradwata, with many small arrows, resisted Vardhakshemi of the Vrishni<br>race who was the embodiment of wrath (in battle). They that looked at<br>Kripa and Vardhakshemi, those heroes conversant with every mode of<br>warfare, thus engaged in encountering each other, became so absorbed in<br>it that, they could not attend to anything else. Somadatta's son, for<br>enhancing the glory of Drona, resisted king Manimat of great activity as<br>the latter came to fight. Then Manimat quickly cut off the bowstring, the<br>standard, the banner, the charioteer and the umbrella of Somadatta's son<br>and caused them to fall down from the latter's car.[49] The son of<br>Somadatta then, bearing the device of the sacrificial stake on his<br>standard, that slayer of foes, quickly jumping down from his car, cut off<br>with his large swords, his antagonist with his steeds, charioteer,<br>standard, and car. Re-ascending then upon his own car, and taking up<br>another bow, and guiding his steeds himself, he began, O monarch, to<br>consume the Pandava host. Vrishasena (the son of Karna), competent for<br>the feat, resisted with showers of arrows king Pandava who was rushing to<br>battle like Indra himself following the Asuras for smiting them. With<br>maces and spiked bludgeons, and swords and axes and stones, short clubs<br>and mallets, and discs, short arrows and battle-axes with dust and wind,<br>and fire and water, and ashes and brick-bats, and straw and trees,<br>afflicting and smitting, and breaking, and slaying and routing the foe,<br>and hurling them on the hostile ranks, and terrifying them therewith,<br>came Ghatotkacha, desirous of getting at Drona. The Rakshasa Alambusha,<br>however, excited with rage, encountered him with diverse weapons and<br>diverse accoutrements of war. And the battle that took place between<br>those two foremost of Rakshasas resembled that which took place in days<br>of old between Samvara and the chief of the celestials. Thus blessed be<br>thou, took place hundreds of single combats between car-warriors and<br>elephants, and steeds and foot-soldiers of thy army and theirs in the<br>midst of the dreadful general engagement. Indeed, such a battle was never<br>seen or heard of before as that which then took place between those<br>warriors that were bent upon Drona's destruction and protection. Indeed,<br>many were the encounters that were then seen on all parts of field, some<br>of which were terrible, some beautiful, and some exceedingly fierce, O<br>lord.'"
