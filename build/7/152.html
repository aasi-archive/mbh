                            (Ghatotkacha-badha Parva)<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'That elephant force of thine, O king, swelling with<br>might, fought everywhere, prevailing over the Pandava force. Resolved to<br>go to the other world, the Panchalas and the Kauravas fought with one<br>another for admission into the swelling domains of Yama. Brave warriors,<br>encountering brave rivals, pierced one another with arrows and lances and<br>darts, and quickly despatched one another unto Yama's abode. Dreadful was<br>the battle that took place between car-warriors and car-warriors who<br>struck one another and caused a fierce flow of blood. Infuriated<br>elephants, encountering infuriated compeers, afflicted one another with<br>their tusks. Horsemen, solicitous of glory, pierced and cut down horsemen<br>in that terrific melee with spears and darts and battle-axes.<br>Foot-soldiers also O mighty-armed one, in hundreds, armed with weapons,<br>repeatedly rushed against one another with resolute courage, O scorcher<br>of foes! So great was the confusion that the Panchalas and the Kurus<br>could only be distinguished from each other by the tribal, the family,<br>and the personal names we heard them utter. The warriors, despatching one<br>another to the other world with arrows and darts and axes, careered<br>fearlessly on the field. With thousands of arrows, however, O king, shot<br>by the combatants the ten points were no longer illuminated as before in<br>consequence of the Sun having set. While the Pandavas were thus fighting,<br>O Bharata, Duryodhana, O king, penetrated into the midst of their host.<br>Filled with great wrath at the slaughter of the ruler of Sindhus, and<br>resolved to lay down his life, he penetrated into the hostile army.<br>Filling the earth with the rattle of his car-wheels and causing her to<br>tremble therewith, thy son approached the Pandava host. Terrific was the<br>clash that took place between him and them, O Bharata, causing a<br>tremendous carnage of troops. Like the sun himself at midday scorching<br>everything with his rays, thy son scorched the hostile host with his<br>arrowy showers.[189] The Pandavas became incapable of even looking at<br>their brother (Duryodhana). Despairing of vanquishing their foes, they<br>set their hearts on flying away from the field. Slaughtered by thy<br>illustrious son, armed with the bow, by means of his gold-winged arrows<br>of blazing points, the Panchalas ran away in all directions. Afflicted<br>with those keen shafts, the Pandava troops began to fall down on the<br>ground. Indeed, the Pandavas had never succeeded in achieving such a feat<br>in battle as was then achieved by thy royal son, O monarch! The Pandava<br>host was crushed and ground by an elephant.[190] As, again, an assemblage<br>of lotuses becomes shorn of its beauty when the water (over which it<br>grows) is dried up by the sun and the wind, even so became the Pandava<br>host being dried up by thy son, O Bharata, the Panchalas, with Bhimasena<br>then with ten shafts, and each of the sons of Madri with three, and<br>Virata and Drupada each with six, and Sikhandin with a hundred, and<br>Dhrishtadyumna with seventy, and Yudhishthira with seven, and the<br>Kaikeyas and the Chedis with innumerable keen shafts, and Satwata with<br>five, and each of the (five) sons of Draupadi with three, and Ghatotkacha<br>also with a few, he uttered a leonine shout. Cutting off hundreds of<br>other warriors and the bodies of elephants and steeds in that great<br>battle by means of his fierce shafts, he behaved like the Destroyer<br>himself in rage slaying created beings.[191] While engaged, however, in<br>thus slaughtering his foes, his bow, the back of whose staff was<br>ornamented with gold, Yudhishthira, the son of Pandu, O sire, cut off<br>into three parts with a pair of broad-headed shafts. And Yudhishthira<br>pierced Duryodhana himself with ten keen arrows shot with great force.<br>Piercing through Duryodhana's vital limbs, those passed out and entered<br>the earth in a continuous line. The troops that stood around then<br>encompassed Yudhishthira, like the celestials encompassing Purandara for<br>the slaughter of Vritra. Then king Yudhishthira, O sire, who is incapable<br>of being easily defeated, shot at thy son in that battle a fierce shaft.<br>Deeply pierced therewith, Duryodhana sat down on his excellent car. Then<br>a loud noise arose from among the Panchala troops. Even this, O monarch,<br>was that tremendous uproar, viz., 'The king is slain!' The fierce whizz<br>of arrows also was heard there, O Bharata. Then Drona quickly showed<br>himself there in that battle. Meanwhile, Duryodhana recovering his<br>senses, had firmly grasped the bow. He then rushed towards the royal son<br>of Pandu saying, 'Wait, Wait.' Then the Panchalas also solicitous of<br>victory, began to advance with speed. Desirous of rescuing the Kuru<br>prince, Drona received them all. And the preceptor began to destroy them<br>like the bright-rayed maker of day destroying tempest-tossed clouds.<br>Then, O king, there occurred a fierce battle, fraught with immense<br>carnage, between thine and theirs encountering one another from desire of<br>fight.'"
