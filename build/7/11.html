                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Hear, O Sanjaya, the celestial feats of Vasudeva,<br>feats that Govinda achieved and the like of which no other person hath<br>ever been able to achieve. Whilst being brought up, O Sanjaya, in the<br>family of the cowherd (Nanda), that high-souled one, while yet a boy,<br>made the might of his arms known to the three worlds. Even then he slew<br>Hayaraja, living in the woods (on the shores) of the Yamuna, who was<br>equal to (the celestial steed) Uchchaisravas in strength and the wind<br>itself in speed.[18] In childhood, he also slew with his two bare arms,<br>the Danava, in the form of a bull, of terrible deeds, and risen like<br>Death himself unto all the kine. Of eyes like the lotus petals, he also<br>slew the mighty Asuras named Pralamva, and Naraka, and Jambha, and Pitha,<br>as also Mura, that terror of the celestials. And so also Kansa of mighty<br>energy, who was, besides, protected by Jarasandha, was, with all his<br>followers, slain in battle by Krishna aided by his prowess alone.[19]<br>With Valadeva as his second, that slayer of foes, viz., Krishna, consumed<br>in battle, with all his troops, the king of the Surasenas, viz., Sunaman,<br>of great activity and prowess in battle, the lord of a full Akshauhini,<br>and the valiant second brother of Kansa, the king of the Bhojas. The<br>highly wrathful regenerate Rishi (gratified with the adoration) gave him<br>boons.[20] Of eyes like the lotus petals, and endued with great bravery,<br>Krishna, vanquishing all the kings at a self-choice, bore away the<br>daughter of the king of the Gandharas. Those angry kings, as if they were<br>horses by birth, were yoked unto his nuptial car and were lacerated with<br>the whip. The mighty-armed Janardana also caused Jarasandha, the lord of<br>a full Akshauhini of troops, to be slain through the instrumentality of<br>another.[21] The mighty Krishna also slew the valiant king of Chedis,<br>that leader of kings, as if he were some animal, on the occasion of the<br>latter's disputing about the Arghya. Putting forth his prowess, Madhava<br>hurled unto the sea the Daitya city called Saubha, (moving) in the skies,<br>protected by Salwa, and regarded as impregnable. The Angas, the Vangas,<br>the Kalingas, the Magadhas, the Kasis, the Kosalas, the Vatsyas, the<br>Gargyas, the Karushas and the Paundras,&#8212;all these he vanquished in<br>battle. The Avantis, the Southerners, the Mountaineers, the Daserakas,<br>the Kasmirakas, the Aurasikas, the Pisachas, the Samudgalas, the<br>Kamvojas, the Vatadhanas, the Cholas, the Pandyas, O Sanjaya, the<br>Trigartas, the Malavas, the Daradas difficult of being vanquished, the<br>Khasas arrived from diverse realms, as also the Sakas, and the Yavanas<br>with followers, were all vanquished by him of eyes like lotus-petals. In<br>days of old, penetrating into the very sea, he vanquished in battle<br>Varuna himself in those watery depths, surrounded by all kinds of aquatic<br>animals. Slaying in battle (the Danava named) Panchajanya living in the<br>depths of Patala, Hrishikesa obtained the celestial conch called<br>Panchajanya. The mighty Kesava, accompanied by Partha, having gratified<br>Agni at Khandava, obtained his invincible weapon of fire, viz., his<br>discus (called Sudarsana). Riding on Vinata's son and frightening (the<br>denizens of) Amaravati, the heroic Krishna brought from Mahendra himself<br>(the celestial flower called) Parijata. Knowing Krishna's prowess, Sakra<br>quietly bore that act.[22] We have never heard that there is any one<br>among the kings who has not been vanquished by Krishna. That exceedingly<br>wonderful feat also, O Sanjaya, which the lotus-eyed one performed in my<br>court, who else is capable of performing it? And since, humbled by<br>devotion, I was suffered to behold Krishna as the Supreme Lord;<br>everything (about that feat) is well-known to me, myself having witnessed<br>it with my own eyes, O Sanjaya, the end can never be seen of the<br>(infinite) achievements of Hrishikesa. of great energy and great<br>intelligence. Gada, and Samva, and Pradyumna, and Viduratha, and<br>Charudeshna, and Sarana, and Ulmukha, and Nisatha, and the valiant<br>Jhilivabhru, and Prithu, and Viprithu, and Samika, and Arimejaya,&#8212;these<br>and other mighty Vrishni heroes, accomplished in smiting, will, standing<br>on the field of battle, take up their position in the Pandava host, when<br>summoned by that Vrishni hero, viz., the high-souled Kesava. Everything<br>(on my side) will then be in great danger. Even this is what I think. And<br>there where Janardana is, there will be the heroic Rama, equal in<br>strength to ten thousand elephants, resembling the Kailasa peak, decked<br>with garlands of wild flowers, and armed with the plough. That Vasudeva,<br>O Sanjaya, whom all the regenerate ones describe as the Father of all,<br>will that Vasudeva fight for the sake of the Pandavas? O son, O Sanjaya,<br>if he puts on his armour for the sake of the Pandavas, there is none<br>amongst us who can be his antagonist. If the Kauravas happen to vanquish<br>the Pandavas, he, of the Vrishni race, will then, for the sake of the<br>latter, take up his mighty weapon. And that tiger among men, that<br>mighty-armed one, slaying then all the kings in battle as also the<br>Kauravas, will give away the whole earth to Kunti's son. What car will<br>advance in battle against that car which has Hrishikesa for its driver<br>and Dhananjaya for its warrior? The Kurus cannot, by any means, gain<br>victory. Tell me, then everything about how the battle took place. Arjuna<br>is Kesava's life and Krishna is always victory; in Krishna is always<br>fame. In all the worlds, Vibhatsu is invincible. In Kesava are infinite<br>merits in excess. The foolish Duryodhana, who doth not know Krishna or<br>Kesava, seems, through Destiny, to have Death's noose before him. Alas,<br>Duryodhana knows not Krishna of Dasarha's race and Arjuna the son of<br>Pandu. These high-souled ones are ancient gods. They are even Nara and<br>Narayana. On earth they are seen by men as; two separate forms, though in<br>reality they are both possessed but by one soul. With the mind alone,<br>that invincible pair, of world-wide fame, can, if only they wish it,<br>destroy this host. Only, in consequence of their humanity they do not<br>wish it.[23] Like a change of the Yuga, the death of Bhishma, O child,<br>and the slaughter of the high-souled Drona, overturn the senses. Indeed,<br>neither by Brahmacharya, nor by the study of the Vedas, nor by<br>(religious) rites, nor by weapons, can any one prevent death. Hearing of<br>the slaughter of Bhishma and Drona, those heroes accomplished in weapons,<br>respected by all the worlds, and invincible in battle, why O Sanjaya, do<br>I yet live? In consequence of the death of Bhishma and Drona, O Sanjaya,<br>we will henceforth have to live as dependants on that prosperity<br>beholding which in Yudhishthira we had before been so jealous. Indeed,<br>this destruction of the Kurus hath come in consequence only of my acts. O<br>Suta, in killing these that are ripe for destruction, the very straw<br>becomes thunderbolt. That prosperity is without end in this; world which<br>Yudhishthira is about to obtain&#8212;Yudhishthira through whose wrath both<br>Bhishma and Drona have fallen. In consequence of his very disposition,<br>hath Righteousness gone over to the side of Yudhishthira, while it is<br>hostile to my son. Alas, time, so cruel, that hath now come for the<br>destruction of all, cannot be overcome. Things calculated in one way, O<br>son, even by men of intelligence, become otherwise through Destiny. This<br>is what I think. Therefore, tell me everything that has taken place<br>during the progress of this unavoidable and dreadful calamity productive<br>of the most sorrowful reflection incapable of being crossed over (by<br>us).'"
