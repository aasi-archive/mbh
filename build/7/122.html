                            "Sanjaya said, 'Meanwhile, O king, Duhsasana rushed against the grandson<br>of Sini, scattering thousands of shafts like a mighty cloud pouring<br>torrents of rain. Having pierced Satyaki with sixty arrows and once more<br>with sixteen, he failed to make that hero tremble, for the latter stood<br>it, battle, immovable as the Mainaka mountain. Accompanied by a large<br>throng of cars hailing from diverse realms, that foremost one of<br>Bharata's race shot numberless arrows, and filled all the points of the<br>compass with roars deep as those of the clouds. Beholding the Kaurava<br>coming to battle, Satyaki of mighty arms rushed towards him and shrouded<br>him with his shafts. They that were at the van of Duhsasana, thus covered<br>with those arrowy showers, all fled away in fear, in the very sight of<br>thy son. After they had fled away, O monarch, thy son Duhsasana, O king,<br>remained fearlessly in battle and began to afflict Satyaki with arrows.<br>And piercing the four steeds of Satyaki with four arrows, his charioteer<br>with three, and Satyaki himself with a hundred in that battle, Duhsasana<br>uttered a loud roar, Then, O monarch, Madhava, inflamed with rage, soon<br>made Duhsasana's car and driver and standard and Duhsasana himself<br>invisible by means of his straight arrows. Indeed, Satyaki entirely<br>shrouded the brave Duhsasana with arrows. Like a spider entangling a gnat<br>within reach by means of its threads, that vanquisher of foes quickly<br>covered Duhsasana with his shafts. Then King Duryodhana, seeing Duhsasana<br>thus covered with arrows, urged a body of Trigartas towards the car of<br>Yuyudhana. Those Trigarta car-warriors, of fierce deeds, accomplished in<br>battle, and numbering three thousand, proceeded towards Yuyudhana. Firmly<br>resolved upon battle and swearing not to retreat, all of them encompassed<br>Yuyudhana with a large throng of cars, Soon, however, Yuyudhana struck<br>down five hundred of their foremost warriors stationed in the van of the<br>force as it advanced towards him in battle, shooting showers of arrows at<br>him. Speedily slain by that foremost one amongst the Sinis with his<br>shafts, these fell down, like tall trees from mountain-tops uprooted by a<br>tempest. And the field of battle, strewn with mangled elephants, O<br>monarch, and fallen standards, and bodies of steeds decked in trappings<br>of gold, and torn and lacerated with the shafts of Sini's grandson and<br>weltering in blood, looked beautiful, O king, like a plain overgrown with<br>flowering Kinsukas. Those soldiers of thine, thus slaughtered by<br>Yuyudhana, failed to find a protector like elephants sunk in a morass.<br>Then all of them turned towards the spot where Drona's car was, like<br>mighty snakes making towards holes from fear of the prince of birds.<br>Having slain those five hundred brave warriors by in means of his shafts,<br>resembling snakes of virulent poison, that hero slowly proceeded towards<br>the place where Dhananjaya was. And as that foremost of men was thus<br>proceeding thy son Duhsasana quickly pierced him with nine straight<br>arrows. That mighty bowman then (Yuyudhana), pierced Duhsasana, in<br>return, with five straight and sharp arrows equipped with golden wings<br>and vulturine feather. Then Duhsasana, O Bharata, smiling the while,<br>pierced Satyaki, O monarch, with three arrows, and once more with five.<br>The grandson of Sini, then, striking thy Son with five arrows and Cutting<br>off his bow proceeded smilingly towards Arjuna. Then Duhsasana, inflamed<br>with wrath and desirous of slaying the Vrishni hero, hurled at him, as he<br>proceeded, a dart made wholly of iron. Satyaki, however, O king, cut off,<br>with his shafts, equipped with Kanka feathers, that fierce dart Of thy<br>son. Then, O ruler of men, then, thy son, taking up another bow, pierced<br>Satyaki with some arrows and uttered a loud roar. Then Satyaki excited<br>with wrath, stupefying thy son in that battle, struck him in the centre<br>of the chest with some shafts that resembled flames of fire. And once<br>more, he pierced Duhsasana with eight shafts made wholly of iron and<br>having very keen points. Duhsasana, however, pierced Satyaki in return<br>with twenty arrows. Then, the highly-blessed Satyaki, O monarch, pierced<br>Duhsasana in the centre of the chest with three straight arrows. And the<br>mighty car-warrior Yuyudhana, with some straight shafts slew the steeds<br>of Duhsasana; inflamed with wrath he slew, with some straight arrows,<br>that the latter's charioteer also. With one broad-headed arrow he then<br>cut off thy son's bow, and with five arrows he cut the leathern fence<br>that encased his hand. Acquainted as he was with highest weapons,<br>Satyaki, then, with a couple of broad-headed shafts, cut off Duhsasana's<br>standard and the wooden shafts of his car. And then with a number of keen<br>arrows he slew both the Parshni charioteers of thy son. The latter, then,<br>bowless and carless and steedless and driverless, was taken up by the<br>leader of the Trigarta warriors on his car. The grandson of Sini, then, O<br>Bharata, pursuing him a moment, restrained himself and slew him not, for<br>the mighty-armed hero recollected the words of Bhimasena. Indeed,<br>Bhimasena, O Bharata, vowed in the midst of the assembly the destruction<br>of all thy sons in battle. Then, O lord, Satyaki, having thus vanquished<br>Duhsasana, quickly proceeded, O king, along the track by which Dhananjaya<br>had gone before him.'"
