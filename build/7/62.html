                            "Narada said, 'Mandhatri' the son of Yuvanaswa, O Srinjaya, we hear, fell<br>a prey to death. That king vanquished the gods, the Asuras and men. Those<br>celestials, viz., the twin Aswins, brought him out of his father's womb<br>by a surgical operations. Once on a time, king Yuvanaswa while chasing<br>the deer in the forest, became very thirsty and his steeds also became<br>exceedingly fatigued. Beholding a wreath of smoke, the king (directed by<br>it) went to a sacrifice and drank the sacred sacrificial butter that lay<br>scattered there. (The king, thereupon, conceived). Beholding that<br>Yuvanaswa was quick with child, those best of physicians, viz., the twin<br>Aswins among the celestials, extracted the child from the king's womb.<br>Seeing that child of celestial splendour lying on the lap on his father,<br>the gods said unto one another, 'What shall support this child?' Then<br>Vasava said, 'Let the child suck my fingers,' Thereupon from the fingers<br>of Indra issued milk sweet as nectar. And since Indra from compassion,<br>said, 'He will draw his sustenance from me,' and showed him that<br>kindness, therefore, the gods named that child Mandhatri.[103] Then jets<br>of milk and clarified butter dropped into the mouth of Yuvanaswa's son<br>from the hand of the high-souled Indra. The boy continued to suck the<br>hand of Indra and by that means to grow. In twelve days he became twelve<br>cubits in stature and endued with great prowess. And he conquered the<br>whole of this earth in the course of a single day. Of virtuous soul,<br>possessed of great intelligence, heroic, devoted to truth and a master of<br>his passions, Mandhatri vanquished, by his bow Janamejaya and Sudhanwan<br>and Jaya and Suna[104] and Vrihadratha and Nriga. And the lands lying<br>between the hill where the sun rises and the hill where he sets, are<br>known to this day as the dominion of Mandhatri. Having performed a<br>hundred Horse-sacrifices and a hundred Rajasuya sacrifices also, he gave<br>away, O monarch, unto the Brahmanas, some Rohita fish made of gold, that<br>were ten Yojanas in length and one Yojana in breadth. Mountains of<br>savoury food and comestibles of diverse kinds, after the Brahmanas had<br>been entertained, were eaten by others, (who came at his sacrifices) and<br>contributed to their gratification. Vast quantities of food and eatables<br>and drink, and mountains of rice, looked beautiful as they stood. Many<br>rivers, having lakes of clarified butter, with diverse kinds of soup for<br>their mire, curds for their froth and liquid honey for their water,<br>looking beautiful, and wafting honey and milk, encircled mountains of<br>solid viands. Gods and Asuras and Men and Yakshas and Gandharvas and<br>Snakes and Birds, and many Brahmanas, accomplished in the Vedas and their<br>branches, and many Rishis came to his sacrifices. Amongst those present<br>there, none was illiterate. King Mandhatri, having bestowed the earth<br>bounded by the seas and full of wealth upon the Brahmanas, at last<br>disappeared like the sun. Filling all the points of the compass with his<br>fame, he repaired to the regions of the righteous. When he died, O<br>Srinjaya, who excelled thee in the four cardinal virtues and who,<br>superior to thee, was much superior to thy son, thou shouldst not grieve,<br>saying, 'Oh, Swaitya, Oh, Swaitya' for the latter who performed no<br>sacrifice and made no sacrificial gift.'"
