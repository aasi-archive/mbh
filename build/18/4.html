                            Vaishampayana said, "King Yudhishthira, thus praised by the gods, the<br>Maruts and the Rishis, proceeded to that place where those foremost ones<br>of Kurus race were. He beheld Govinda endued with his Brahma-form. It<br>resembled that form of his which had been seen before and which,<br>therefore, helped the recognition. Blazing forth in that form of his, he<br>was adorned with celestial weapons, such as the terrible discus and<br>others in their respective embodied forms. He was being adored by the<br>heroic Phalguna, who also was endued with a blazing effulgence. The son<br>of Kunti beheld the slayer of Madhu also in his own form. Those two<br>foremost of Beings, adored by all the gods, beholding Yudhishthira,<br>received him with proper honours.<br><br>"In another place, the delighter of the Kurus beheld Karna, that foremost<br>one among all wielders of weapons, resembling a dozen Suryas in<br>splendour. In another part he beheld Bhimasena of great puissance,<br>sitting in the midst of the Maruts, and endued with a blazing form. He<br>was sitting by the side of the God of Wind in his embodied form. Indeed,<br>he was then in a celestial form endued with great beauty, and had<br>attained to the highest success. In place belonging to the Ashvinis, the<br>delighter of the Kurus beheld Nakula and Sahadeva, each blazing with his<br>own effulgence.<br><br>"He also beheld the princess of Pancala, decked in garlands of lotuses.<br>Having attained to Heaven, she was sitting there, endued with a form<br>possessed of solar splendour. King Yudhishthira suddenly wished to<br>question her. Then the illustrious Indra, the chief of the gods, spoke to<br>him, This one is Sree herself. It was for your sake that she took birth,<br>as the daughter of Drupada, among human beings, issuing not from any<br>mothers womb, O Yudhishthira, endued with agreeable perfume and capable<br>of delighting the whole world. For your pleasure, she was created by the<br>wielder of the trident. She was born in the race of Drupada and was<br>enjoyed by you all. These five highly blessed Gandharvas endued with the<br>effulgence of fire, and possessed of great energy, were, O king, the sons<br>of Draupadi and yourself.<br><br>"Behold Dhritarashtra, the king of the Gandharvas, possessed of great<br>wisdom. Know that this one was the eldest brother of thy sire. This one<br>is thy eldest brother, the son of Kunti, endued with effulgence of fire.<br>The son of Surya, thy eldest brother, the foremost of men, even this one<br>was known as the son of Radha. He moves in the company of Surya. Behold<br>this foremost of Beings. Among the tribes of the Saddhyas, the gods, the<br>Viswedevas, and the Maruts, behold, O king of kings, the mighty<br>car-warriors of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas, viz., those heroes having<br>Satyaki for their first, and those mighty ones among the Bhojas. Behold<br>the son of Subhadra, invincible in battle, now staying with Soma. Even he<br>is the mighty bowman Abhimanyu, now endued with the gentle effulgence of<br>the great luminary of the night. Here is the mighty bowman Pandu, now<br>united with Kunti and Madri. Thy sire frequently comes to me on his<br>excellent car. Behold the royal Bhishma, the son of Santanu, now in the<br>midst of the Vasus. Know that this one by the side of Brihaspati is thy<br>preceptor Drona. These and other kings, O son of Pandu, who had warred on<br>thy side now walk with the Gandharvas or Yakshas or other sacred beings.<br>Some have attained to the status of Guhyakas, O king. Having cast off<br>their bodies, they have conquered Heaven by the merit they had acquired<br>through word, thought and deed.
