                            Janamejaya said, "O holy one, according to what rites should the learned<br>listen to the Bharata? What are the fruits (acquirable by hearing it)?<br>What deities are to be worshipped during the several paranas? What should<br>be the gifts that one should make, O holy one, at every parva or sacred<br>day (during the continuance of the recitation)? What should be the<br>qualification of the reciter to be engaged? Tell me all this!<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "Hear, O king, what the procedure is, and what the<br>fruits, O Bharata, are that will spring from ones listening (to a<br>recitation of the Bharata). Even this, O king of kings, is what thou<br>askest me. The deities of Heaven, O ruler of Earth, came to this world<br>for sport. Having achieved their task, they ascended once more to Heaven.<br>Listen to what I shall tell thee in brief. In the Mahabharata is to be<br>found the births of Rishis and deities on the Earth. In this treatise,<br>called Bharata, O foremost one of Bharatas race, are to be seen in one<br>place the eternal Rudras, the Saddhyas, and the Viswedevas; the Adityas,<br>the two deities named the Ashvinis, the regents of the World, the great<br>Rishis, the Guhyakas, the Gandharvas, the Nagas, the Vidyadharas, the<br>Siddhas, the diverse deities, the Self-born visible in a body, with many<br>ascetics; the Hills and Mountains, Oceans and Seas and Rivers, the<br>diverse tribes of Apsaras; the Planets, the Years, the Half-years, and<br>the Seasons; and the whole universe of mobile and immobile entities, with<br>all the gods and Asuras.<br><br>"Hearing their celebrity, and in consequence of a recitation of their<br>names and achievements, a man that has committed even terrible sins, will<br>be cleansed. Having, with a concentrated soul and cleansed body, heard<br>this history duly, from the beginning, and having reached its end, one<br>should make Sraddha offerings, O Bharata, unto those (foremost of persons<br>who have been mentioned in it). Unto the Brahmanas also, O chief of<br>Bharatas race, should, with due devotion and according to ones power, be<br>made large gifts and diverse kinds of gems, and kine, and vessels of<br>white brass for milking kine, and maidens decked with every ornament, and<br>possessed of every accomplishment suited to enjoyment, as also diverse<br>kinds of conveyances, beautiful mansions, plots of land, and cloths.<br>Animals also should be given, such as horses and elephants in rage, and<br>beds, and covered conveyances borne on the shoulders of men, and<br>well-decked cars. Whatever objects occur in the house, of the foremost<br>kind, whatever wealth of great value occurs in it, should be given away<br>unto Brahmanas. Indeed, one should give away ones own self, wives, and<br>children.<br><br>"One desirous of hearing the Bharata, should hear it without a doubting<br>heart, with cheerfulness and joy; and as, he proceeds listening to its<br>recitation, he should according to the extent of his power, make gifts<br>with great devotion.<br><br>"Hear how a person that is devoted to truth and sincerity, that is<br>self-restrained, pure (in mind), and observant of those acts which lead<br>to purity of body, that is endued with faith, and that has subjugated<br>wrath, attains to success (in the matter of a recitation of the Bharata).<br>He should appoint as reciter one that is pure (of body), that is endued<br>with good and pious conduct, that should be robed in white, that should<br>have a complete mastery over his passions, that is cleansed of all<br>offences, that is conversant with every branch of learning, that is<br>endued with faith, that is free from malice, that is possessed of<br>handsome features, that is blessed, self-restrained, truthful, and with<br>passions under control, and that is beloved of all for the gifts he makes<br>and the honours of which he is the possessor.<br><br>"The reciter, seated at his ease, free from all bodily complaints, and<br>with rapt attention, should recite the text without too much slowness,<br>without a labouring voice, without being fast or quick, quietly, with<br>sufficient energy, without confusing the letters and words together, in a<br>sweet intonation and with such accent and emphasis as would indicate the<br>sense giving full utterance to the three and sixty letters of the<br>alphabet from the eight places of their formation. Bowing unto Narayana,<br>and to Nara, that foremost of men, as also to the goddess Sarasvati,<br>should the word Jaya be uttered.<br><br>"Listening to the Bharata, O king, when recited, O thou of Bharatas race,<br>by a reader of this kind, the listener, observant of vows all the while<br>and cleansed by purificatory rites, acquires valuable fruits. When the<br>first Parana is reached, the hearer should gratify Brahmanas with<br>presents of all desirable objects. By doing this, one obtains the fruits<br>of the Agnishtoma sacrifice. He acquires a large (celestial) car teeming<br>with diverse orders of Apsaras (that wait upon him). With a glad heart,<br>and with the deities in his company, he proceeds to Heaven, his heart<br>rapt (in felicity).<br><br>"When the second Parana is reached, the hearer acquires the fruits of the<br>Atiratra vow. Indeed, he ascends a celestial car made entirely of<br>precious gems. Wearing celestial garlands and robes, and decked with<br>celestial unguents and always shedding a celestial fragrance around, he<br>receives high honours in Heaven.<br><br>"When the third Parana is reached, he acquires the fruits of the<br>Dwadasaha vow. Indeed be resides in Heaven for myriads of years, like a<br>god.<br><br>"At the fourth Parana he acquires the fruits of the Vajapeya sacrifice.<br><br>"At the fifth, twice those fruits are his. Ascending a celestial car that<br>resembles the rising sun or a blazing fire, and with the deities for his<br>companions, he goes to Heaven and sports in felicity for myriads of years<br>in the abode of Indra.<br><br>"At the sixth Parana, twice, and at the seventh, thrice those fruits<br>become his. Ascending a celestial car that resembles the summit of the<br>Kailasa mountains (in beauty), that is equipt with an altar made of<br>stones of lapis lazuli and other precious gems, that is surrounded by<br>beautiful objects of diverse kinds, that is decked with gems and corals,<br>that moves at the will of the rider, and that teems with waiting Apsaras,<br>he roves through all the regions of felicity, like a second deity of the<br>Sun.<br><br>"At the eight Parana, he acquires the fruits of the Rajasuya sacrifice.<br>He ascends a car as beautiful as the rising moon, and unto which are<br>yoked steeds white as the rays of the moon and endued with the speed of<br>thought. He is served by women of the foremost beauty and whose faces are<br>more charming than the moon. He hears the music of the garlands that<br>encircle their waists and the Nupuras encircling their ankles. Sleeping<br>with his head resting on the laps of women of transcendent beauty, he<br>awakes greatly refreshed.<br><br>"At the ninth Parana, he acquires, O Bharata, the fruits of that foremost<br>of sacrifices, viz., the Horse-sacrifice. Ascending on a car equipt with<br>a chamber consisting of a top supported by columns of gold, furnished<br>with a seat made of stones of lapis lazuli, with windows on all sides<br>made of pure gold, and teeming with waiting Apsaras and Gandharvas and<br>other celestials, he blazes forth in splendour. Wearing celestial<br>garlands and robes, and decked with celestial unguents, he sports in<br>bliss, with deities for his companions, in Heaven, like a second deity<br>himself.<br><br>"Reaching the tenth Parana and gratifying Brahmanas, he acquires a car<br>which tinkles with innumerable bells, which is decked with flags and<br>banners, which is equipt with a seat made of precious gems, which has<br>many arches made of lapis lazuli, which has a net-work of gold all round,<br>which has turrets made of corals, which is adorned with Gandharvas and<br>Apsaras well-skilled in singing, and which is fit for the residence of<br>the Righteous. Crowned with a diadem of the complexion of fire, decked<br>with ornaments of gold, his person smeared with celestial sandalpaste,<br>garnished with celestial wreaths, he roves through all celestial regions,<br>enjoying all celestial objects of enjoyment, and endued with great<br>splendour, through the grace of the deities.<br><br>"Thus accoutred, he receives high honours in Heaven for many long years.<br>With Gandharvas in his company, for full 21,000 years, he sports in bliss<br>with Indra himself in abode of Indra. He roves at pleasure every day<br>through the diverse regions of the gods, riding on celestial cars and<br>conveyances, and surrounded by celestial damsels of transcendent beauty.<br>He is able to go to the abode of the solar deity, of the lunar deity, and<br>of Siva, O king. Indeed, he succeeds in living in the same region with<br>Vishnu himself. It is even so, O monarch. There is no doubt in this. A<br>person listening with faith, becomes even so. My preceptor has said this.<br>Unto the reciter should be given all such objects as he may wish.<br>Elephants and steeds and cars and conveyances, especially animals and the<br>vehicles they draw, a bracelet of gold, a pair of ear-rings, sacred<br>threads, beautiful robes, and perfumes in especial (should be given). By<br>worshipping him as a deity one attains to the regions of Vishnu.<br><br>"After this I shall declare what should be given away, as each parva is<br>reached of the Bharata in course of its recitation, unto brahmanas, after<br>ascertaining their birth, country, truthfulness, and greatness, O chief<br>of Bharatas race, as also their inclination for piety, and unto<br>kshatriyas too, O king, after ascertainment of similar particulars.<br>Causing the Brahmanas to utter benedictions, the business of recitation<br>should be begun. When a parva is finished, the brahmanas should be<br>worshipped to the best of ones power. At first, the reciter, clad in good<br>robes and smeared with perfumed paste, should, O king, be duly fed with<br>honey and frumenty of the best kind.<br><br>"When the Astika-parva is being recited, brahmanas should be entertained<br>with fruits and roots, and frumenty, and honey and clarified butter, and<br>rice boiled with raw sugar.<br><br>"When the Sabha-parva is being recited, brahmanas should be fed with<br>habisya along with apupas and pupas and modakas, O king.<br><br>"When the Aranyaka-parva is being recited, superior brahmanas should be<br>fed with fruits and roots.<br><br>"When the Arani-parva is reached, water-pots full of water should be<br>given away. Many superior kinds of delicious food, also rice and fruits<br>and roots, and food possessed of every agreeable attribute, should be<br>presented unto the brahmanas.<br><br>"During the recitation of the Virata-parva diverse kinds of robes should<br>be given away; and during that of the Udyoga-parva, O chief of the<br>Bharatas, the twice-born ones, after being decked with perfumes and<br>garlands, should be entertained with food possessed of every agreeable<br>quality.<br><br>"During the recitation of the Bhishma-parva, O king of kings, after<br>giving them excellent cars and conveyances, food should be given that is<br>pure and well-cooked and possessed of every desirable attribute.<br><br>"During the Drona-parva food of very superior kind should be given to<br>learned brahmanas, as also beds, O monarch, and bows and good swords.<br><br>"During the recitation of the Karna-parva, food of the foremost kind,<br>besides being pure and well-cooked, should be presented unto the<br>brahmanas by the house-holder with rapt mind.<br><br>"During the recitation of the Shalya-parva, O king of kings, food with<br>confectionery and rice boiled with raw sugar, as also cakes of wheat and<br>soothing and nutritive viands and drinks should be presented.<br><br>"During the recitation of the Gada-parva, brahmanas should be entertained<br>with food mixed with mudga.<br><br>"During the recitation of the Stri-parva, foremost of brahmanas should be<br>entertained with gems and precious stones; and during the recitation of<br>the Aishika-parva, rice boiled in ghee should first be given, and then<br>food pure and well-cooked, and possessed of every desirable quality,<br>should be presented.<br><br>"During the recitation of the Shanti-parva, the brahmanas should be fed<br>with havisya.<br><br>"When the Asvamedhika-parva is reached, food possessed of every agreeable<br>quality should be given; and when the Asramvasika is reached, brahmanas<br>should be entertained with havisya.<br><br>"When the Mausala is reached, scents and garlands possessed of agreeable<br>qualities should be given away.<br><br>"During the Mahaprasthanika, similar presents should be made, possessed<br>of every quality of an agreeable kind.<br><br>"When the Svarga-parva is reached, the brahmanas should be fed with<br>havisya.<br><br>"Upon the conclusion of the Harivansa, a 1,000 brahmanas should be fed.<br>Unto each of them should be presented a cow accompanied with a piece of<br>gold. Half of this should be presented to each poor man, O king.<br><br>"Upon the conclusion of all the Parvas, the house-holder of wisdom should<br>give unto the reciter a copy of the Mahabharata with a piece of gold.<br>When the Harivansa Parva is being recited, Brahmanas should be fed with<br>frumenty at each successive Parana, O king. Having finished all the<br>Parvas, one versed in the scriptures, robing himself in white, wearing<br>garlands, decked with ornaments, and properly purified, should place a<br>copy of the Mahabharata on an auspicious spot and cover it with a piece<br>of silken cloth and worship it, according to due rites, with scents and<br>garlands, offering each at a time. Indeed, O king, the several volumes of<br>this treatise should be worshipped by one with devotion and concentrated<br>mind. Offerings should be made unto them of diverse kinds of food and<br>garlands and drinks and diverse auspicious articles of enjoyment. Gold<br>and other precious metals should be given as Dakshina. The names should<br>then be taken of all the deities as also of Nara and Narayana. Then,<br>adorning the persons of some foremost of Brahmanas with scents and<br>garlands, they should be gratified with diverse kinds of gifts of<br>enjoyable and very superior or costly articles. By doing this, one<br>attains to the merits of the Atiratra sacrifice. Indeed, at each<br>successive Parva, he acquires the merits that attach to the performance<br>of a sacrifice. The reciter, O chief of the Bharatas, should be possessed<br>of learning and endued with a good voice and a clear utterance respecting<br>both letters and words. Even such a man should, O chief of the Bharatas,<br>recite the Bharata. After entertaining a number of foremost Brahmanas,<br>presents should be made unto them according to the ordinances. The<br>reciter also, O chief of the Bharatas, should be decked with ornaments<br>and fed sumptuously. The reciter being gratified, the house-holder<br>attains to an excellent and auspicious contentment. If the Brahmanas are<br>gratified, all the deities are gratified. After this, O chief of the<br>Bharatas, Brahmanas should be duly entertained with diverse kinds of<br>enjoyable articles and superior things.<br><br>"I have thus indicated the ordinances, O foremost of men, (about the<br>manner of reciting these scriptures) in answer to thy enquiries. Thou<br>shouldst observe them with faith. In listening to a recitation of the<br>Bharata and at each Parana, O best of kings, one that desires to attain<br>to the highest good should listen with the greatest care and attention.<br>One should listen to the Bharata every day. One should proclaim the<br>merits of the Bharata every day. One in whose house the Bharata occurs,<br>has in his hands all those scriptures which are known by the name of<br>Jaya. The Bharata is cleansing and sacred. In the Bharata are diverse<br>topics. The Bharata is worshipped by the very gods. The Bharata is the<br>highest goal. The Bharata, O chief of the Bharatas, is the foremost of<br>all scriptures. One attains to Emancipation through the Bharata. This<br>that I tell thee is certain truth. One that proclaims the merits of this<br>history called the Mahabharata, of the Earth, of the cow, of Sarasvati<br>(the goddess of speech), of Brahmanas, and of Keshava, has never to<br>languish.<br><br>"In the Vedas, in the Ramayana, and in the sacred Bharata, O chief of<br>Bharatas race, Hari is sung in the beginning, the middle, and at the end.<br>That in which occur excellent statements relating to Vishnu, and the<br>eternal Srutis, should be listened to by men desirous of attaining to the<br>highest goal. This treatise is sanctifying. This is the highest indicator<br>as regards duties; this is endued with every merit. One desirous of<br>prosperity should listen to it. Sins committed by means of the body, by<br>means of words, and by means of the mind, are all destroyed (through<br>listening to the Bharata) as Darkness at sunrise. One devoted to Vishnu<br>acquires (through this) that merit which is acquired by listening to the<br>eighteen Puranas. There is no doubt in this. Men and women (by listening<br>to this) would certainly attain to the status of Vishnu. Women desirous<br>of having children should certainly listen to this which proclaims the<br>fame of Vishnu. One desirous of attaining to the fruits that attach to a<br>recitation of the Bharata should, according to ones power, give unto the<br>reciter Dakshina, as also an honorarium in gold. One desirous of ones own<br>good should give unto the reciter a Kapila cow with horns cased in gold<br>and accompanied by her calf, covered with a cloth. Ornaments, O chief of<br>Bharatas race, for the arms, as also those for the ears, should be given.<br>Besides these, other kinds of wealth should be presented. Unto the<br>reciter, O king of men, gift of land should be made. No gift like that of<br>land could ever be or will be. The man that listens (to the Bharata) or<br>that recites it to other people, becomes cleansed of all his sins and<br>attains at last to the status of Vishnu. Such a man rescues his ancestors<br>to the eleventh degree, as also himself with his wives and sons, O chief<br>of Bharatas race. After concluding a recitation of the Bharata, one<br>should, O king, perform a Homa with all its ten parts.<br><br>"I have thus, O chief of men, told everything in thy presence. He that<br>listens with devotion to this Bharata from the beginning becomes cleansed<br>of every sin even if he be guilty of Brahmanicide or the violation of his<br>preceptors bed, or even if he be a drinker of alcohol or a robber of<br>other peoples wares, or even if he be born in the Chandala order.<br>Destroying all his sins like the maker of day destroying darkness, such a<br>man, without doubt, sports in felicity in the region of Vishnu like<br>Vishnu himself."<br><br>The End of the Svargarohanika-parva<br><br>The Eighteen parvas of the Mahabharata are thus complete
