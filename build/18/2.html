                            "Yudhishthira said, Ye deities, I do not see here Radhas son of<br>immeasurable prowess, as also my high-souled brothers, and Yudhamanyu and<br>Uttamaujas, those great car-warriors that poured their bodies (as<br>libations) on the fire of battle, those kings and princes that met with<br>death for my sake in battle. Where are those great car-warriors that<br>possessed the prowess of tigers? Have those foremost of men acquired this<br>region? If those great car-warriors have obtained these regions, then<br>only do you know, ye gods, that I shall reside here with those<br>high-souled ones. If this auspicious and eternal region has not been<br>acquired by those kings, then know, ye gods, that without those brothers<br>and kinsmen of mine, I shall not live here. At the time of performing the<br>water rites (after the battle), I heard my mother say, Do thou offer<br>oblations of water unto Karna. Since hearing those words of my mother, I<br>am burning with grief. I grieve also incessantly at this, ye gods, that<br>when I marked the resemblance between the feet of my mother and those of<br>Karna of immeasurable soul, I did not immediately place myself under<br>orders of that afflicter of hostile ranks. Ourselves joined with Karna,<br>Shakra himself would have been unable to vanquish in battle. Wherever may<br>that child of Surya be, I desire to see him. Alas, his relationship with<br>us being unknown, I caused him to be slain by Arjuna. Bhima also of<br>terrible prowess and dearer to me than my life-breaths, Arjuna too,<br>resembling Indra himself, the twins also that resembled the Destroyer<br>himself in prowess, I desire to behold. I wish to see the princess of<br>Pancala, whose conduct was always righteous. I wish not to stay here. I<br>tell you the truth. Ye foremost ones among the deities, what is Heaven to<br>me if I am dissociated from my brothers? That is Heaven where those<br>brothers of mine are. This, in my opinion, is not Heaven.<br><br>"The gods said, If thou longest to be there, go then, O son, without<br>delay. At the command of the chief of the deities, we are ready to do<br>what is agreeable to thee.<br><br>Vaishampayana continued: Having said so, the gods then ordered the<br>celestial messenger, O scorcher of foes, saying, Do thou show unto<br>Yudhishthira his friends and kinsmen. Then the royal son of Kunti and the<br>celestial messenger proceeded together, O foremost of kings, to that<br>place where those chiefs of men (whom Yudhishthira had wished to see)<br>were. The celestial messenger proceeded first, the king followed him<br>behind. The path was inauspicious and difficult and trodden by men of<br>sinful deeds. It was enveloped in thick darkness, and covered with hair<br>and moss forming its grassy vesture. Polluted with the stench of sinners,<br>and miry with flesh and blood, it abounded with gadflies and stinging<br>bees and gnats and was endangered by the inroads of grisly bears. Rotting<br>corpses lay here and there. Overspread with bones and hair, it was<br>noisome with worms and insects. It was skirted all along with a blazing<br>fire. It was infested by crows and other birds and vultures, all having<br>beaks of iron, as also by evil spirits with long mouths pointed like<br>needles. And it abounded with inaccessible fastnesses like the Vindhya<br>mountains. Human corpses were scattered over it, smeared with fat and<br>blood, with arms and thighs cut off, or with entrails torn out and legs<br>severed.<br><br>"Along that path so disagreeable with the stench of corpses and awful<br>with other incidents, the righteous-souled king proceeded, filled with<br>diverse thoughts. He beheld a river full of boiling water and, therefore,<br>difficult to cross, as also a forest of trees whose leaves were sharp<br>swords and razors. There were plains full of fine white sand exceedingly<br>heated, and rocks and stones made of iron. There were many jars of iron<br>all around, with boiling oil in them. Many a Kuta-salmalika was there,<br>with sharp thorns and, therefore, exceedingly painful to the touch. The<br>son of Kunti beheld also the tortures inflicted upon sinful men.<br><br>"Beholding that inauspicious region abounding with every sort of<br>foulness, Yudhishthira asked the celestial messenger, saying, How far<br>shall we proceed along a path like this? It behoveth thee to tell me<br>where those brothers of mine are. I desire also to know what region is<br>this of the gods?<br><br><br><br>"Hearing these words of king Yudhishthira the just, the celestial<br>messenger stopped in his course and replied, saying, Thus far is your<br>way. The denizens of Heaven commanded me that having come thus far, I am<br>to stop. If thou art tired, O king of kings, thou mayst return with me.<br><br>"Yudhishthira, however, was exceedingly disconsolate and stupefied by the<br>foul odour. Resolved to return, O Bharata, he retraced his steps.<br>Afflicted by sorrow and grief, the righteous-souled monarch turned back.<br>Just at that moment he heard piteous lamentations all around, O son of<br>Dharma, O royal sage, O thou of sacred origin, O son of Pandu, do thou<br>stay a moment for favouring us. At thy approach, O invincible one, a<br>delightful breeze hath begun to blow, bearing the sweet scent of thy<br>person. Great hath been our relief at this. O foremost of kings,<br>beholding thee, O first of men, great hath been our happiness. O son of<br>Pritha, let that happiness last longer through thy stay here, for a few<br>moments more. Do thou remain here, O Bharata, for even a short while. As<br>long as thou art here, O thou of Kurus race, torments cease to afflict<br>us. These and many similar words, uttered in piteous voices by persons in<br>pain, the king heard in that region, wafted to his ears from every side.<br><br>"Hearing those words of beings in woe, Yudhishthira of compassionate<br>heart exclaimed aloud, Alas, how painful! And the king stood still. The<br>speeches of those woe-begone and afflicted persons seemed to the son of<br>Pandu to be uttered in voices that he had heard before although he could<br>not recognise them on that occasion.<br><br>"Unable to recognise voices, Dharmas son, Yudhishthira, enquired, saying,<br>Who are you? Why also do you stay here?<br><br>"Thus addressed, they answered him from all sides, saying, I am Karna! I<br>am Bhimasena! I am Arjuna! I am Nakula! I am Sahadeva! I am<br>Dhrishtadyumna! I am Draupadi! We are the sons of Draupadi! Even thus, O<br>king, did those voices speak.<br><br>"Hearing those exclamations, O king, uttered in voices of pain suitable<br>to that place, the royal Yudhishthira asked himself What perverse destiny<br>is this? What are those sinful acts which were committed by those<br>high-souled beings, Karna and the sons of Draupadi, and the<br>slender-waisted princess of Pancala, so that their residence has been<br>assigned in this region of foetid smell and great woe? I am not aware of<br>any transgression that can be attributed to these persons of righteous<br>deeds. What is that act by doing which Dhritarashtras son, king<br>Suyodhana, with all his sinful followers, has become invested with such<br>prosperity? Endued with prosperity like that of the great Indra himself,<br>he is highly adored. What is that act through the consequence of which<br>these (high-souled ones) have fallen into Hell? All of them were<br>conversant with every duty, were heroes, were devoted to truth and the<br>Vedas; were observant of Kshatriya practices; were righteous in their<br>acts; were performers of sacrifices; and givers of large presents unto<br>brahmanas. Am I asleep or awake? Am I conscious or unconscious? Or, is<br>all this a mental delusion due to disorders of the brain?<br><br>"Overwhelmed by sorrow and grief, and with his senses agitated by<br>anxiety, king Yudhishthira indulged in such reflections for a long time.<br>The royal son of Dharma then gave way to great wrath. Indeed,<br>Yudhishthira then censured the gods, as also Dharma himself. Afflicted by<br>the very foul odour, he addressed the celestial messenger, saying, Return<br>to the presence of those whose messenger thou art. Tell them that I shall<br>not go back to where they are, but shall stay even here, since, in<br>consequence of my companionship, these afflicted brothers of mine have<br>become comforted. Thus addressed by the intelligent son of Pandu, the<br>celestial messenger returned to the place where the chief of the deities<br>was, viz., he of a hundred sacrifices. He represented unto him the acts<br>of Yudhishthira. Indeed, O ruler of men, he informed Indra of all that<br>Dharmas son had said!
