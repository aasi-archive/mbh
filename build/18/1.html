                            Om! Having bowed down into Narayana, and to Nara, the foremost of men, as<br>also to the goddess Sarasvati, should the word "Jaya" be uttered.<br><br>Janamejaya said, "Having attained to Heaven, what regions were<br>respectively attained by my grandsires of old, viz., the Pandavas and the<br>sons of Dhritarashtra? I desire to hear this. I think that thou art<br>conversant with everything, having been taught by the great Rishi Vyasa<br>of wonderful feats.<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "Listen now to what thy grandsires, Yudhishthira and<br>others, did after having attained to Heaven, that place of the deities.<br>Arrived at Heaven, king Yudhishthira the just, beheld Duryodhana endued<br>with prosperity and seated on an excellent seat. He blazed with<br>effulgence like the sun and wore all those signs of glory which belong to<br>heroes. And he was in the company of many deities of blazing effulgence<br>and of Sadhyas of righteous deeds. Yudhishthira, beholding Duryodhana and<br>his prosperity, became suddenly filled with rage and turned back from the<br>sight.<br><br>"He loudly addressed his companions, saying, I do not desire to share<br>regions of felicity with Duryodhana who was stained by cupidity and<br>possessed of little foresight. It was for him that friends, and kinsmen,<br>over the whole Earth were slaughtered by us whom he had afflicted greatly<br>in the deep forest. It was for him that the virtuous princess of Pancala,<br>Draupadi of faultless features, our wife, was dragged into the midst of<br>the assembly before all our seniors. Ye gods, I have no desire to even<br>behold Suyodhana. I wish to go there where my brothers are.<br><br>"Narada, smiling, told him, It should not be so, O king of kings. While<br>residing in Heaven, all enmities cease. O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, do<br>not say so about king Duryodhana. Hear my words. Here is king Duryodhana.<br>He is worshipped with the gods by those righteous men and those foremost<br>of kings who are now denizens of Heaven. By causing his body to be poured<br>as a libation on the fire of battle, he has obtained the end that<br>consists in attainment of the region for heroes. You and your brothers,<br>who were veritable gods on Earth, were always persecuted by this one. Yet<br>through his observance of Kshatriya practices he has attained to this<br>region. This lord of Earth was not terrified in a situation fraught with<br>terror.<br><br>"O son, thou shouldst not bear in mind the woes inflicted on thee on<br>account of the match at dice. It behoveth thee not to remember the<br>afflictions of Draupadi. It behoveth thee not to remember the other woes<br>which were yours in consequence of the acts of your kinsmen,the woes,<br>viz., that were due to battle or to other situations. Do thou meet<br>Duryodhana now according to the ordinances of polite intercourse. This is<br>Heaven, O lord of men. There can be no enmities here.<br><br>"Though thus addressed by Narada, the Kuru king Yudhishthira, endued with<br>great intelligence, enquired about his brothers and said, If these<br>eternal regions reserved for heroes be Duryodhanas, that unrighteous and<br>sinful wight, that man who was the destroyer of friends and of the whole<br>world, that man for whose sake the entire Earth was devastated with all<br>her horses and elephants and human beings, that wight for whose sake we<br>were burnt with wrath in thinking of how best we might remedy our wrongs,<br>I desire to see what regions have been attained by those high-souled<br>heroes, my brothers of high vows, steady achievers of promises, truthful<br>in speech, and distinguished for courage. The high-souled Karna, the son<br>of Kunti, incapable of being baffled in battle, Dhrishtadyumna, Satyaki,<br>the sons of Dhrishtadyumna and those other Kshatriyas who met with death<br>in the observance of Kshatriya practices, where are those lords of Earth,<br>O Brahmana? I do not see them here, O Narada. I desire to see, O Narada,<br>Virata and Drupada and the other great Kshatriyas headed by Dhrishtaketu,<br>as also Shikhandi, the Pancala prince, the sons of Draupadi, and<br>Abhimanyu, irresistible in battle.
