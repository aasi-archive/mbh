                            Janamejaya said, "Bhishma and Drona, those two high-souled persons, king<br>Dhritarashtra, and Virata and Drupada, and Sankha and Uttara.<br>Dhrishtaketu and Jayatsena and king Satyajit, the sons of Duryodhana, and<br>Shakuni the son of Subala, Karnas sons of great prowess, king Jayadratha,<br>Ghatotkaca and others whom thou hast not mentioned, the other heroic<br>kings of blazing formstell me for what period they remained in Heaven. O<br>foremost of regenerate persons, was theirs an eternal place in Heaven?<br>What was the end attained to by those foremost of men when their acts<br>came to an end? I desire to hear this, O foremost of regenerate persons,<br>and therefore have I asked thee. Through thy blazing penances thou seest<br>all things.<br><br>Sauti said: Thus questioned, that regenerate Rishi, receiving the<br>permission of the high-souled Vyasa, set himself to answer the question<br>of the king.<br><br>Vaishampayana said, "Every one, O king of men, is not capable of<br>returning to his own nature at the end of his deeds. Whether this is so<br>or not, is, indeed a good question asked by thee. Hear, O king, this<br>which is a mystery of the gods, O chief of Bharatas race. It was<br>explained (to us) by Vyasa of mighty energy, celestial vision and great<br>prowess, that ancient ascetic, O Kauravya, who is the son of Parasara and<br>who always observes high vows, who is of immeasurable understanding, who<br>is omniscient, and who, therefore knows the end attached to all acts.<br><br>"Bhishma of mighty energy and great effulgence attained to the status of<br>the Vasus. Eight Vasus, O chief of Bharatas race, are now seen. Drona<br>entered into Brihaspati, that foremost one of Angirasas descendants.<br>Hridikas son Kritavarma entered the Maruts. Pradyumna entered Sanatkumara<br>whence he had issued. Dhritarashtra obtained the regions, so difficult of<br>acquisition, that belong to the Lord of treasures. The famous Gandhari<br>obtained the same regions with her husband Dhritarashtra. With his two<br>wives, Pandu proceeded to the abode of the great Indra. Both Virata and<br>Drupada, the king Dhrishtaketu, as also Nishatha, Akrura, Samva,<br>Bhanukampa, and Viduratha, and Bhurishrava and Sala and king Bhuri, and<br>Kansa, and Ugrasena, and Vasudeva, and Uttara, that foremost of men, with<br>his brother Sankhaall these foremost of persons entered the deities.<br>Somas son of great prowess, named Varchas of mighty energy, became<br>Abhimanyu, the son of Phalguna, that lion among men. Having fought,<br>agreeably to Kshatriya practices, with bravery such as none else had ever<br>been able to show, that mighty-armed and righteous-souled being entered<br>Soma. Slain on the field of battle, O foremost of men, Karna entered<br>Surya. Shakuni obtained absorption into Dwapara, and Dhrishtadyumna into<br>the deity of fire. The sons of Dhritarashtra were all Rakshasas of fierce<br>might. Sanctified by death caused by weapons, those high-souled beings of<br>prosperity all succeeded in attaining to Heaven. Both Kshattri and king<br>Yudhishthira entered into the god of Righteousness. The holy and<br>illustrious Ananta (who had taken birth as Balarama) proceeded to the<br>region below the Earth. Through the command of the Grandsire, he, aided<br>by his Yoga power, supported the Earth. Vasudeva was a portion of that<br>eternal god of gods called Narayana. Accordingly, he entered into<br>Narayana. 16,000 women had been married to Vasudeva as his wives. When<br>the time came, O Janamejaya, they, plunged into the Sarasvati. Casting<br>off their (human) bodies there, they re-ascended to Heaven. Transformed<br>into Apsaras, they approached the presence of Vasudeva. Those heroic and<br>mighty car-warriors, Ghatotkaca and others, who were slain in the great<br>battle, attained to the status, some of gods and some of Yakshas. Those<br>that had fought on the side of Duryodhana are said to have been<br>Rakshasas. Gradually, O king, they have all attained to excellent regions<br>of felicity. Those foremost of men have proceeded, some to the abode of<br>Indra, some to that of Kuvera of great intelligence, and some to that of<br>Varuna. I have now told thee, O thou of great splendour, everything about<br>the acts, O Bharata, of both the Kurus and the Pandavas.<br><br>Sauti said: Hearing this, ye foremost of regenerate ones, at the<br>intervals of sacrificial rites, king Janamejaya became filled with<br>wonder. The sacrificial priests then finished the rites that remained to<br>be gone through. Astika, having rescued the snakes (from fiery death),<br>became filled with joy. King Janamejaya then gratified all the Brahmanas<br>with copious presents. Thus worshipped by the king, they returned to<br>their respective abodes. Having dismissed those learned Brahmanas, king<br>Janamejaya came back from Takshasila to the city named after the elephant.<br><br>I have now told everything that Vaishampayana narrated, at the command of<br>Vyasa, unto the king at his snake sacrifice. Called a history, it is<br>sacred, sanctifying and excellent. It has been composed by the ascetic<br>Krishna, O Brahmana, of truthful speech. He is omniscient, conversant<br>with all ordinances, possessed of a knowledge of all duties, endued with<br>piety, capable of perceiving what is beyond the ken of the senses, pure,<br>having a soul cleansed by penances, possessed of the six high attributes,<br>and devoted to Sankhya Yoga. He has composed this, beholding everything<br>with a celestial eye that has been cleansed (strengthened) by varied<br>lore. He has done this, desiring to spread the fame, throughout the<br>world, of the high-souled Pandavas, as also of other Kshatriyas possessed<br>of abundant wealth of energy.<br><br>That learned man who recites this history of sacred days in the midst of<br>a listening auditory becomes cleansed of every sin, conquers Heaven, and<br>attains to the status of Brahma. Of that man who listens with rapt<br>attention to the recitation of the whole of this Veda composed by (the<br>Island-born) Krishna, a million sins, numbering such grave ones as<br>Brahmanicide and the rest, are washed off. The Pitris of that man who<br>recites even a small portion of this history at a Sraddha, obtain<br>inexhaustible food and drink. The sins that one commits during the day by<br>ones senses or the mind are all washed off before evening by reciting a<br>portion of the Mahabharata. Whatever sins a Brahmana may commit at night<br>in the midst of women are all washed off before dawn by reciting a<br>portion of the Mahabharata.<br><br>The high race of the Bharatas is its topic. Hence it is called Bharata.<br>And because of its grave import, as also of the Bharatas being its topic,<br>it is called Mahabharata. He who is versed in interpretations of this<br>great treatise, becomes cleansed of every sin. Such a man lives in<br>righteousness, wealth, and pleasure, and attains to Emancipation also, O<br>chief of Bharatas race.<br><br>That which occurs here occurs elsewhere. That which does not occur here<br>occurs nowhere else. This history is known by the name of Jaya. It should<br>be heard by every one desirous of Emancipation. It should be read by<br>Brahmanas, by kings, and by women quick with children. He that desires<br>Heaven attains to Heaven; and he that desires victory attains to victory.<br>The woman quick with child gets either a son or a daughter highly<br>blessed. The puissant Island-born Krishna, who will not have to come<br>back, and who is Emancipation incarnate, made an abstract of the Bharata,<br>moved by the desire of aiding the cause of righteousness. He made another<br>compilation consisting of sixty lakhs of verses. Thirty lakhs of these<br>were placed in the region of the deities. In the region of the Pitris<br>fifteen lakhs, it should be known, are current; while in that of the<br>Yakshas fourteen lakhs are in vogue. One lakh is current among human<br>beings.<br><br>Narada recited the Mahabharata to the gods; Asita-Devala to the Pitris;<br>Suka to the Rakshasas and the Yakshas; and Vaishampayana to human beings.<br>This history is sacred, and of high import, and regarded as equal to the<br>Vedas. That man, O Saunaka, who hears this history, placing a Brahmana<br>before him, acquires both fame and the fruition of all his wishes. He<br>who, with fervid devotion, listens to a recitation of the Mahabharata,<br>attains (hereafter) to high success in consequence of the merit that<br>becomes his through understanding even a very small portion thereof. All<br>the sins of that man who recites or listens to this history with devotion<br>are washed off.<br><br>In former times, the great Rishi Vyasa, having composed this treatise,<br>caused his son Suka to read it with him, along with these four Verses.<br>Thousands of mothers and fathers, and hundreds of sons and wives arise in<br>the world and depart from it. Others will (arise and) similarly depart.<br>There are thousands of occasions for joy and hundreds of occasions for<br>fear. These affect only him that is ignorant but never him that is wise.<br>With uplifted arms I am crying aloud but nobody hears me. From<br>Righteousness is Wealth as also Pleasure. Why should not Righteousness,<br>therefore, be courted? For the sake neither of pleasure, nor of fear, nor<br>of cupidity should any one cast off Righteousness. Indeed, for the sake<br>of even life one should not cast off Righteousness. Righteousness is<br>eternal. Pleasure and Pain are not eternal. Jiva is eternal. The cause,<br>however, of Jivas being invested with a body is not so.<br><br>That man who, waking up at dawn, reads this Savittri of the Bharata,<br>acquires all the rewards attached to a recitation of this history and<br>ultimately attains to the highest Brahma. As the sacred Ocean, as the<br>Himavat mountain, are both regarded as mines of precious gems, even so is<br>this Bharata (regarded as a mine of precious gems). The man of learning,<br>by reciting to others this Veda or Agama composed by (the Island-born)<br>Krishna, earns wealth. There is no doubt in this that he who, with rapt<br>attention, recites this history called Bharata, attains to high success.<br>What need has that man of a sprinkling of the waters of Pushkara who<br>attentively listens to this Bharata, while it is recited to him? It<br>represents the nectar that fell from the lips of the Island-born. It is<br>immeasurable, sacred, sanctifying, sin-cleansing, and auspicious.
