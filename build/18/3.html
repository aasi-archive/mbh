                            Vaishampayana said, "King Yudhishthira the just, the son of Pritha, had<br>not stayed there for more than a moment when, O thou of Kurus race, all<br>the gods with Indra at their head came to that spot. The deity of<br>Righteousness in his embodied form also came to that place where the Kuru<br>king was, for seeing that monarch. Upon the advent of those deities of<br>resplendent bodies and sanctified and noble deeds, the darkness that had<br>overwhelmed that region immediately disappeared. The torments undergone<br>by beings of sinful deeds were no longer seen. The river Vaitarani, the<br>thorny Salmali, the iron jars, and the boulders of rock, so terrible to<br>behold, also vanished from sight. The diverse repulsive corpses also,<br>which the Kuru king had seen, disappeared at the same time. Then a<br>breeze, delicious and fraught with pleasant perfumes, perfectly pure and<br>delightfully cool, O Bharata, began to blow on that spot in consequence<br>of the presence of the gods. The Maruts, with Indra, the Vasus with the<br>twin Ashvinis, the Sadhyas, the Rudras, the Adityas, and the other<br>denizens of Heaven, as also the Siddhas and the great Rishis, all came<br>there where Dharmas royal son of great energy was.<br><br>"Then Shakra, the lord of the deities, endued with blazing prosperity,<br>addressed Yudhishthira and comforting him, said, O Yudhishthira of mighty<br>arms, come, come, O chief of men. These illusions have ended, O puissant<br>one. Success has been attained by thee, O mighty-armed one, and eternal<br>regions (of felicity) have become thine. Thou shouldst not yield to<br>wrath. Listen to these words of mine. Hell, O son, should without doubt<br>be beheld by every king. Of both good and bad there is abundance, O chief<br>of men. He who enjoys first the fruits of his good acts must afterwards<br>endure Hell. He, on the other hand, who first endures Hell, must<br>afterwards enjoy Heaven. He whose sinful acts are many enjoys Heaven<br>first. It is for this, O king, that desirous of doing thee good, I caused<br>thee to be sent for having a view of Hell. Thou hadst, by a pretence,<br>deceived Drona in the matter of his son. Thou hast, in consequence<br>thereof, been shown Hell by an act of deception. After the manner of<br>thyself, Bhima and Arjuna, and Draupadi, have all been shown the place of<br>sinners by an act of deception. Come, O chief of men, all of them have<br>been cleansed of their sins. All those kings who had aided thee and who<br>have been slain in battle, have all attained to Heaven. Come and behold<br>them, O foremost one of Bharatas race.<br><br>"Karna, the mighty bowman, that foremost of all wielders of weapons for<br>whom thou art grieving, has also attained to high success. Behold, O<br>puissant one, that foremost of men, viz., the son of Surya. He is in that<br>place which is his own, O mighty-armed one. Kill this grief of thine, O<br>chief of men. Behold thy brothers and others, those kings, that is, who<br>had espoused thy side. They have all attained to their respective places<br>(of felicity). Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled. Having endured a<br>little misery first, from this time, O son of Kurus race, do thou sport<br>with me in happiness, divested of grief and all thy ailments dispelled. O<br>mighty-armed one, do thou now enjoy, O king, the rewards of all thy deeds<br>of righteousness of those regions which thou hast acquired thyself by thy<br>penances and of all thy gifts. Let deities and Gandharvas, and celestial<br>Apsaras, decked in pure robes and excellent ornaments, wait upon and<br>serve thee for thy happiness. Do thou, O mighty-armed one, enjoy now<br>those regions (of felicity) which have become thine through the Rajasuya<br>sacrifice performed by thee and whose felicities have been enhanced by<br>the sacrificial scimitar employed by thee. Let the high fruits of thy<br>penances be enjoyed by thee. Thy regions, O Yudhishthira, are above,<br>those of kings. They are equal to those of Hariscandra, O son of Pritha.<br>Come, and sport there in bliss. There where the royal sage Mandhatri is,<br>there where king Bhagiratha is, there where Dushmantas son Bharata is,<br>there wilt thou sport in bliss. Here is the celestial river, sacred and<br>sanctifying the three worlds. It is called Heavenly Ganga. Plunging into<br>it, thou wilt go to thy own regions. Having bathed in this stream, thou<br>wilt be divested of thy human nature. Indeed, thy grief dispelled, thy<br>ailments conquered, thou wilt be freed from all enmities.<br><br>"While, O Kuru king, the chief of the gods was saying so unto<br>Yudhishthira, the deity of Righteousness, in his embodied form, then<br>addressed his own son and said, O king, I am greatly pleased, O thou of<br>great wisdom, with thee, O son, by thy devotion to me, by thy<br>truthfulness of speech, and forgiveness, and self-restraint. This,<br>indeed, is the third test, O king, to which I put thee. Thou art<br>incapable, O son of Pritha, of being swerved from thy nature or reason.<br>Before this, I had examined thee in the Dwaita woods by my questions,<br>when thou hadst come to that lake for recovering a couple of fire sticks.<br>Thou stoodst it well. Assuming the shape of a dog, I examined thee once<br>more, O son, when thy brothers with Draupadi had fallen down. This has<br>been thy third test; thou hast expressed thy wish to stay at Hell for the<br>sake of thy brothers. Thou hast become cleansed, O highly blessed one.<br>Purified of sin, be thou happy.<br><br>O son of Pritha, thy brothers, O king, were not such as to deserve Hell.<br>All this has been an illusion created by the chief of the gods. Without<br>doubt, all kings, O son, must once behold Hell. Hence hast thou for a<br>little while been subjected to this great affliction. O king, neither<br>Arjuna, nor Bhima, nor any of those foremost of men, viz., the twins, nor<br>Karna, ever truthful in speech and possessed of great courage, could be<br>deserving of Hell for a long time. The princess Krishna too, O<br>Yudhishthira, could not be deserving of that place of sinners. Come,<br>come, O foremost one of the Bharatas, behold Ganga who spreads her<br>current over the three worlds.<br><br>"Thus addressed, that royal sage, viz., thy grandsire, proceeded with<br>Dharma and all the other gods. Having bathed in the celestial river<br>Ganga, sacred and sanctifying and ever adored by the Rishis, he cast off<br>his human body. Assuming then a celestial form, king Yudhishthira the<br>just, in consequence of that bath, became divested of all his enmities<br>and grief. Surrounded by the deities, the Kuru king Yudhishthira then<br>proceeded from that spot. He was accompanied by Dharma, and the great<br>Rishis uttered his praises. Indeed, he reached that place where those<br>foremost of men, those heroes, viz., the Pandavas and the Dhartarashtras,<br>freed from (human) wrath, were enjoying each his respective status.
