                            "Sanjaya said, 'O Pandava, the world hath heard thy conduct being<br>righteous. I see it also to be so, O son of Pritha. Life is transient,<br>that may end in great infamy; considering this, thou shouldst not perish.<br>O Ajatasatru, if without war, the Kurus will not yield thy share, I<br>think, it is far better for thee to live upon alms in the kingdom of the<br>Andhakas and the Vrishnis than obtain sovereignty by war. Since this<br>mortal existence is for only a short period, and greatly liable to blame,<br>subject to constant suffering, and unstable, and since it is never<br>comparable to a good name, therefore, O Pandava, never perpetrate a sin.<br>It is the desires, O ruler of men, which adhere to mortal men and are an<br>obstruction to a virtuous life. Therefore, a wise man should beforehand<br>kill them all and thereby gain a stainless fame in the world, O son of<br>Pritha. The thirst after wealth is but like fetter in this world; the<br>virtue of those that seek it is sure to suffer. He is wise who seeketh<br>virtue alone; desires being increased, a man must suffer in his temporal<br>concerns, O sire. Placing virtue before all other concerns of life, a man<br>shineth like the sun when its splendour is great. A man devoid of virtue,<br>and of vicious soul, is overtaken by ruin, although he may obtain the<br>whole of this earth. Thou hast studied the Vedas, lived the life of a<br>saintly Brahman, hast performed sacrificial rites, made charities to<br>Brahmanas. Even remembering the highest position (attainable by beings),<br>thou hast also devoted thy soul for years and years to the pursuit of<br>pleasure. He who, devoting himself excessively to the pleasures and joys<br>of life, never employeth himself in the practice of religious meditation,<br>must be exceedingly miserable. His joys forsake him after his wealth is<br>gone and his strong instincts goad him on towards his wonted pursuit of<br>pleasure. Similarly, he who, never having lived a continent life,<br>forsaketh the path of virtue and commiteth sin, hath no faith in<br>existence of a world to come. Dull as he is after death he hath torment<br>(for his lot). In the world to come, whether one's deeds be good or evil<br>these deeds are in no case, annihilated. Deeds, good and evil, precede<br>the agent (in his journey to the world to come); the agent is sure to<br>follow in their path. Your work (in this life) is celebrated by all as<br>comparable to that food, savoury and dainty, which is proper to be<br>offered with reverence to the Brahmanas&#8212;the food which is offered in<br>religious ceremonies with large donations (to the officiating priests).<br>All acts are done, so long as this body lasts, O son of Pritha. After<br>death there is nothing to be done. And thou hast done mighty deeds that<br>will do good to thee in the world to come, and they are admired by<br>righteous men. There (in the next world) one is free from death and<br>decrepitude and fear, and from hunger and thirst, and from all that is<br>disagreeable to the mind; there is nothing to be done in that place,<br>unless it be to delight one's senses. Of this kind, O ruler of men, is<br>the result of our deeds. Therefore, do not from desire act any longer in<br>this world. Do not, O Pandu's son, betake to action in this world and<br>thereby thus take leave of truth and sobriety and candour and humanity.<br>Thou mayst perform the Rajasuya and the Aswamedha sacrifices, but do not<br>even come near an action which in itself is sin! If after such a length<br>of time, ye sons of Pritha, you now give way to hate, and commit the<br>sinful deed, in vain, for virtue's sake, did ye dwell for years and years<br>in the woods in such misery! It was in vain that you went to exile, after<br>parting with all your army; for this army was entirely in your control<br>then. And these persons who are now assisting you, have been always<br>obedient to you,&#8212;this Krishna, and Satyaki, and Virata of the golden<br>car, of Matsya land, with his son at the head of martial warriors. All<br>the kings, formerly vanquished by you would have espoused your cause at<br>first. Possessed of mighty resources, dreaded by all, having an army, and<br>followed behind by Krishna and Arjuna, you might have slain your foremost<br>of foes on the field of battle. You might have (then) brought low<br>Duryodhana's pride. O Pandava, why have you allowed your foes to grow so<br>powerful? Why have you weakened your friends? Why have you sojourned in<br>the woods for years and years? Why are you now desirous of fighting,<br>having let the proper opportunity slip? An unwise or an unrighteous man<br>may win prosperity by means of fighting; but a wise and a righteous man,<br>were he free from pride to betake to fight (against better instinct),<br>doth only fall away from a prosperous path. O Pritha's son, your<br>understanding inclines not to an unrighteous course. From wrath you ever<br>committed a sinful act. Then what is the cause, and what is the reason,<br>for which you are now intent to do this deed, against the dictates of<br>wisdom? Wrath, O mighty king, is a bitter drug, though it has nothing to<br>do with disease; it brings on a disease of the head, robs one of his fair<br>fame, and leads to sinful acts. It is drunk up (controlled) by those that<br>are righteous and not by those that are unrighteous. I ask you to swallow<br>it and to desist from war. Who would incline himself to wrath which leads<br>to sin? Forbearance would be more beneficial to you than love of<br>enjoyments where Bhishma would be slain, and Drona with his son, and<br>Kripa, and Somadatta's son, and Vikarna and Vivingsati, and Karna and<br>Duryodhana. Having slain all these, what bliss may that be, O Pritha's<br>son, which you will get? Tell me that! Even having won the entire<br>sea-girt earth, you will never be free from decrepitude and death,<br>pleasure and pain, bliss and misery. Knowing all this, do not be engaged<br>in war. If you are desirous of taking this course, because your<br>counsellors desire the same, then give up (everything) to them, and run<br>away. You should not fall away from this path which leads to the region<br>of the gods!'"
