                            "Arjuna said, 'Thou art now, O Kesava, the best friend of all the Kurus.<br>Related with both the parties, thou art the dear friend of both. It<br>behoveth thee to bring about peace between the Pandavas and the sons of<br>Dhritarashtra. Thou, O Kesava, art competent and, therefore, it behoveth<br>thee to bring about a reconciliation. O lotus-eyed one, proceeding hence<br>for peace, O slayer of foes, say unto our ever-wrathful brother<br>Suyodhana, what, indeed, should be said, 'If the foolish Duryodhana doth<br>not accept thy auspicious and beneficial counsels fraught with virtue and<br>profit, he will surely then be the victim of his fate.'<br><br>"The holy one said, 'Yes, I will go to king Dhritarashtra, desirous of<br>accomplishing what is consistent with righteousness, what may be<br>beneficial to us, and what also is for the good of the Kurus.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The night having passed away, a bright sun<br>arose in the east. The hour called Maitra set in, and the rays of the sun<br>were still mild. The month was (Kaumuda Kartika) under the constellation<br>Revati. It was the season of dew, Autumn having departed. The earth was<br>covered with abundant crops all around. It was at such a time that<br>Janardana, the foremost of mighty persons, in enjoyment of excellent<br>health, having heard the auspicious, sacred-sounding and sweet words of<br>gratified Brahmanas, like Vasava himself hearing the adorations of the<br>(celestial) Rishis,&#8212;and having also gone through the customary acts and<br>rites of the morning, purified himself by a bath, and decked his person<br>with unguents and ornaments, worshipped both the Sun and Fire. And having<br>touched the tail of a bull and reverently bowed to the Brahmanas, walked<br>round the sacred fire, and cast his eyes on the (usual) auspicious<br>articles placed in view, Janardana recollected Yudhishthira's word and<br>addressed Sini's grandson Satyaki, seated near, saying, 'Let my car be<br>made ready and let my conch and discus along with my mace, and quivers<br>and darts and all kinds of weapons, offensive and defensive, be placed on<br>it, for Duryodhana and Karna and Suvala's son are all of wicked souls,<br>and foes, however contemptible, should never be disregarded by even a<br>powerful person. Understanding the wishes of Kesava, the wielder of the<br>discus and the mace, his attendants immediately addressed themselves to<br>yoke his car. And that car resembled in effulgence the fire that shows<br>itself at the time of the universal dissolution, and itself in speed. And<br>it was provided with two wheels that resembled the sun and the moon in<br>lustre. And it bore emblazonments of moons, both crescent and full, and<br>of fishes, animals, and birds and it was adorned with garlands of diverse<br>flowers and with pearls and gems of various kinds all around. And endued<br>with the splendour of the rising sun, it was large and handsome. And<br>variegated with gems and gold, it was furnished with an excellent<br>flag-staff bearing beautiful pennons. And well-supplied with every<br>necessary article, and incapable of being resisted by the foe, it was<br>covered with tiger-skins, and capable of robbing the fame of every foe,<br>it enhanced the joy of the Yadavas. And they yoked unto it those<br>excellent steeds named Saivya and Sugriva and Meghapushpa and Valahaka,<br>after these had been bathed and attired in beautiful harness. And<br>enhancing the dignity of Krishna still further, Garuda, the lord of the<br>feathery creation, came and perched on the flag-staff of that car<br>producing a terrible rattle. And Saurin then mounted on that car, high as<br>the summit of the Meru, and producing a rattle, deep and loud as the<br>sound of the kettle-drum or the clouds and which resembled the celestial<br>car coursing at the will of the rider. And taking Satyaki also upon it,<br>that best of male beings set out, filling the earth and the welkin with<br>the rattle of his chariot-wheels. And the sky became cloudless, and<br>auspicious winds began to blow around, and the atmosphere freed from the<br>dust became pure. Indeed, as Vasudeva set out, auspicious animals and<br>birds, whirling by the right side, began to follow him, and cranes and<br>peacocks and swans all followed the slayer of Madhu, uttering cries of<br>good omens. The very fire, fed with Homa libations in accompaniment with<br>Mantras, freed from smoke blazed up cheerfully, sending forth its flames<br>towards the right. And Vasishtha and Vamadeva, and Bhuridyumna and Gaya,<br>and Kratha and Sukra and Kusika and Bhrigu, and other Brahmarshis and<br>celestial Rishis united together, all stood on the right side of Krishna,<br>that delighter of the Yadavas, that younger brother of Vasava. And thus<br>worshipped by those and other illustrious Rishis and holy men, Krishna<br>set out for the residence of the Kurus. And while Krishna was proceeding,<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, followed him, as also Bhima and Arjuna<br>and those other Pandavas, viz., the twin sons of Madri. And the valiant<br>Chekitana and Dhrishtaketu, the ruler of the Chedis, and Drupada and the<br>king of Kasi and that mighty car-warrior Sikhandin, and Dhrishtadyumna,<br>and Virata with his sons, and the princes of Kekaya also,&#8212;all these<br>Kshatriyas followed that bull of the Kshatriya race to honour him. And<br>the illustrious king Yudhishthira the just, having followed Govinda to<br>some distance, addressed him in these words in the presence of all those<br>kings. And the son of Kunti embraced that foremost of all persons, who<br>never, from desire, or anger, or fear, or purpose of gain committed the<br>least wrong, whose mind was ever steady, who was a stranger to<br>covetousness, who was conversant with morality and endued with great<br>intelligence and wisdom, who knew the hearts of all creatures and was the<br>lord of all, who was the God of gods, who was eternal, who was possessed<br>of every virtue, and who bore the auspicious mark on his breast. And<br>embracing him the king began to indicate what he was to do.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'That lady who hath brought us from our infancy; who<br>is ever engaged in facts and ascetic penances and propitiatory rites and<br>ceremonies; who is devoted to the worship of the gods and guests; who is<br>always engaged in waiting upon her superiors who is fond of her sons,<br>bearing for them an affection that knows no bounds; who, O Janardana, is<br>dearly loved by us; who, O grinder of foes, repeatedly saved us from the<br>snares of Suyodhana, like a boat saving a ship-wrecked crew from the<br>frightful terrors of the sea; and who, O Madhava, however undeserving of<br>woe herself, hath on our account endured countless sufferings,&#8212;should be<br>asked about her welfare-Salute and embrace, and, oh, comfort her over and<br>over, overwhelmed with grief as she is on account of her sons by talking<br>of the Pandavas. Ever since her marriage she hath been the victim,<br>however undeserving, of sorrow and griefs due to the conduct of her<br>father-in-law, and suffering hath been her position. Shall I, O Krishna,<br>ever see the time when, O chastiser of foes, my afflictions being over, I<br>shall be able to make my sorrowing mother happy? On the eve of our exile,<br>from affection for her children, she ran after us in anguish, crying<br>bitterly. But leaving her behind, we went into the woods. Sorrow doth not<br>necessarily kill. It is possible, therefore, that she is alive, being<br>hospitably entertained by the Anartas, though afflicted with sorrow on<br>account of her sons. O glorious Krishna, salute her for me, the Kuru king<br>Dhritarashtra also, and all those monarchs who are senior to us in age,<br>and Bhishma, and Drona, and Kripa, and king Vahlika, and Drona's son and<br>Somadatta, and in fact, every one of the Bharata race, and also Vidura<br>endued with great wisdom, that counsellor of the Kurus, of profound<br>intellect and intimate acquaintance with morality,&#8212;should all, O slayer<br>of Madhu, be embraced by thee!' Having in the presence of the kings, said<br>these words unto Kesava, Yudhishthira, with Krishna's permission, came<br>back having at first walked round him. Then Arjuna, proceeding a few<br>steps, further said unto his friend, that bull among men, that slayer of<br>hostile heroes, that invincible warrior of Dasarha's race, 'It is known<br>to all the kings, O illustrious Govinda, that at our consultation it was<br>settled that we should ask back the kingdom. If without insulting us, if<br>honouring thee, they honestly give us what we demand, then, O mighty<br>armed one, they would please me greatly and would themselves escape a<br>terrible danger. If, however, Dhritarashtra's son, who always adopts<br>improper means, acts otherwise, then I shall surely, O Janardana,<br>annihilate the Kshatriya race.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'When Arjuna said these words, Vrikodara was<br>filled with delight. And that son of Pandu continually quivered with<br>rage; and while still quivering with rage and the delight that filled his<br>heart upon hearing Dhananjaya's words, he set forth a terrible shout. And<br>hearing that shout of his, all the bowmen trembled in fear and steeds and<br>elephants were seen to pass urine and excreta. And having addressed<br>Kesava then and informed him of his resolution. Arjuna with Janardana's<br>permission, came back, having first embraced him. And after all the kings<br>had desisted following him, Janardana set out with a cheerful heart on<br>his car drawn by Saivya, Sugriva, and others. And those steeds of<br>Vasudeva, urged by Daruka, coursed onwards, devouring the sky and<br>drinking the road. And on his way Kesava of mighty arms met with some<br>Rishis blazing with Brahmic lustre, standing on both sides of the road,<br>And soon alighting from his car, Janardana saluted them reverently. And<br>worshipping them duly, he enquired of them, saying, 'Is there peace in<br>all the world? Is virtue being duly practised? And the other three orders<br>obedient to the Brahmanas? And having duly worshipped them, the slayer of<br>Madhu again said, 'Where have ye been crowned with success? Whither would<br>ye go, and for what object? What also shall I do for yourselves? What has<br>brought your illustrious selves down on the earth?' Thus addressed,<br>Jamadagni's son, the friend of Brahma&#8212;that lord of both gods and<br>Asuras,&#8212;approached Govinda the slayer of Madhu, embraced him, and said,<br>'The celestial Rishis of pious deeds, and Brahmanas of extensive<br>acquaintance with the scriptures, and royal sages, O Dasarha, and<br>venerable ascetic,&#8212;these witnesses, O illustrious one, of the former<br>feats of gods and Asuras,&#8212;are desirous of beholding all the Kshatriyas<br>of the earth assembled from every side as also the counsellors sitting in<br>the assembly, the kings, and thyself the embodiment of truth, O<br>Janardana. O Kesava, we will go thither for beholding that grand sight.<br>We are also anxious, O Madhava, to listen to those words fraught with<br>virtue and profit, which will be spoken by thee, O chastiser of foes,<br>unto the Kurus in the presence of all the kings. Indeed, Bhishma, and<br>Drona, and others, as also the illustrious Vidura and thyself, O tiger<br>among the Yadavas,&#8212;Ye all will be assembled together in conclave! We<br>desire, O Madhava, to hear the excellent, truthful, and beneficial words<br>that thou wilt utter and they also, O Govinda. Thou art now informed of<br>our purpose, O thou of mighty arms. We will meet thee again. Go thither<br>safely, O hero. We hope to see thee in the midst of the conclave, seated<br>on an excellent seat mustering all thy energy and might.'"
