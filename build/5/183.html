                            "Bhishma said, 'After the battle had ceased, my charioteer, well-skilled<br>in such operations, drew out from his own body, from the bodies of my<br>steeds, and from my body as well, the arrows that struck there. Next<br>morning, when the sun rose, the battle commenced again, my horses having<br>(a little while before) been bathed and allowed to roll on the ground and<br>having had their thirst slaked and thereby re-invigorated. And beholding<br>me coming quickly to the encounter attired in a coat of mail and<br>stationed on my car, the mighty Rama equipped his car with great care.<br>And I myself also, beholding Rama coming towards me from desire of<br>battle, placed aside my bow and quickly descended from my car. Saluting<br>Rama I re-ascended it, O Bharata, and desirous of giving battle, stood<br>fearlessly before that son of Jamadagni. I then overwhelmed him with a<br>thick shower of arrows, and he too covered me with an arrowy shower in<br>return. And filled with wrath. Jamadagni's son once more shot at me a<br>number of fierce shafts of great force and blazing mouths looking like<br>veritable snakes! And I too, O king, shooting sharp shafts by hundreds<br>and thousands, repeatedly cut: off Rama's arrows in mid-air before they<br>could come at me. Then the mighty son of Jamadagni began to hurl<br>celestial weapons at me, all of which I repelled, desirous of achieving<br>mightier feats, O thou of strong arms, with-my weapons. And loud was the<br>din that then arose in the welkin all around. At that time, I hurled at<br>Rama the weapon named Vayavya which Rama neutralised, O Bharata, by the<br>weapon called Guhyaka. Then I applied, with proper mantras, the weapon<br>called Agneya but the lord Rama neutralised that weapon of mine by one<br>(of his) called Varuna. And it was in this way that I neutralised the<br>celestial weapons of Rama, and that chastiser of foes, Rama also, endued<br>with great energy and acquainted with celestial weapons, neutralised the<br>weapons shot by me. Then, O monarch, that best of Brahmanas, the mighty<br>son of Jamadagni, filled with wrath, suddenly wheeling to my right,<br>pierced me in the breast. At this, O best of the Bharatas, I swooned on<br>my best of cars. And beholding me, reft of consciousness, my charioteer<br>quickly bore me away from the field. And seeing me afflicted and pierced<br>with Rama's weapons and borne away drooping and in a swoon, all the<br>followers of Rama, including Akritavrana and others and the princess of<br>Kasi, filled with joy, O Bharata, began to shout aloud! Regaining<br>consciousness then, I addressed my charioteer, saying,&#8212;Go where Rama<br>stayeth! My pains have left me, and I am ready for battle!&#8212;Thus<br>instructed, my charioteer soon took me where Rama was, with the aid of<br>those exceedingly handsome steeds of mine that seemed to dance as they<br>coursed (through the plain) and that were endued with the speed of the<br>wind. And approaching Rama then, O thou of Kuru's race, and filled with<br>wrath, from desire of vanquishing his angry self, I overwhelmed him with<br>an arrowy shower! But Rama, shooting three for every single of mine, cut<br>into fragments every one of my straight-going arrows in mid air before<br>any of them could reach him! And beholding those well-furnished arrows of<br>mine by hundreds and thousands, each cut off in twain by Rama's arrows,<br>all the followers of Rama were filled with joy. Impelled then by the<br>desire of slaying him, I shot at Rama, the son of Jamadagni, a<br>good-looking arrow of blazing effulgence with Death's self sitting at its<br>head. Struck very forcibly therewith and succumbing to its impetus, Rama<br>fell into a swoon and dropped down on the ground. And when Rama thus<br>dropped on the ground, exclamations of Oh and Alas arose on all sides,<br>and the whole universe, O Bharata, was filled with confusion and alarm,<br>such as may be witnessed if the sun himself were ever to fall down from<br>the firmament! Then all those ascetics together with the princess of<br>Kasi, quietly proceeded, O son of Kuru's race, with great anxiety towards<br>Rama. And embracing him, O Kaurava, they began to comfort him softly with<br>the touch of their hands, rendered cold by contact with water, and with<br>assurances of victory. Thus comforted, Rama rose up and fixing an arrow<br>to his bow he addressed me in an agitated voice, saying, 'Stay, O<br>Bhishma! Thou art already slain! And let off by him, that arrow quickly<br>pierced my left side in that fierce encounter. And struck therewith, I<br>began to tremble like a tree shaken by the tempest. Slaying my horses<br>then in terrific combat, Rama, fighting with great coolness, covered me<br>with swarms of winged arrows, shot with remarkable lightness of hand. At<br>this, O mighty-armed one, I also began to shoot arrows with great<br>lightness of hand for obstructing Rama's arrowy shower. Then those arrows<br>shot by myself and Rama covering the welkin all around, stayed even there<br>(without failing down). And, thereupon, enveloped by clouds of arrows the<br>very sun could not shed its rays through them. And the very wind,<br>obstructed by those clouds, seemed to be unable to pass through them.<br>Then, in consequence of the obstructed motion of the wind, the rays of<br>the sun, and the clash of the arrows against one another, a conflagration<br>was caused in the welkin. And then those arrows blazed forth in<br>consequence of the fire generated by themselves, and fell on the earth,<br>consumed into ashes! Then Rama, O Kaurava, filled with rage, covered me<br>with hundreds and thousands and hundreds of thousands and hundreds of<br>millions arrows! And I also, O king, with my arrows resembling snakes of<br>virulent poison, cut into fragments all those arrows of Rama and caused<br>them to fall down on the earth like snakes cut into pieces. And it was<br>thus, O best of the Bharatas, that combat took place. When, however, the<br>shades of evening approached, my preceptor withdrew from the fight.'"
