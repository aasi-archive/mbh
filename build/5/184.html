                            "Bhishma said, 'The next day, O bull of Bharata's race, frightful again<br>was the combat that wok place between me and Rama when I encountered him<br>once more. That hero of virtuous soul, conversant with celestial<br>weapons,&#8212;the lord Rama, from day to day, began to use diverse kinds of<br>celestial weapons. Regardless of life itself, which is so difficult of<br>being sacrificed, in that fierce combat, O Bharata, I baffled all those<br>weapons with such of mine as are capable of baffling them. And, O<br>Bharata, when diverse weapons were in this way neutralised and baffled by<br>means of counter-weapons, Rama, of mighty energy began to contend against<br>me in that battle, reckless of his own life. Seeing all his weapons<br>baffled, the high-souled son of Jamadagni then hurled at me a fierce<br>lance, blazing like a meteor, with flaming mouth, filling the whole<br>world, as it were, with its effulgence, and resembling the dart hurled by<br>Death himself! I, however, with my arrows cut into three fragments that<br>blazing dart rushing against me, and resembling in effulgence the sun<br>that rises at end of the Yuga! At this, breezes charged with fragrant<br>odours began to blow (around me). Beholding that dart of his cut off,<br>Rama, burning with anger, hurled a dozen other fierce darts. Their forms,<br>O Bharata, I am incapable of describing in consequence of their great<br>effulgence and speed. How, indeed, shall I describe their forms?<br>Beholding those diverse-looking darts approach me from all sides, like<br>long tongues of fire and blazing forth with fierce energy like the dozen<br>suns that arise at the time of the destruction of the universe, I was<br>filled with fear. Seeing an arrowy net advancing against me, I baffled it<br>with an arrowy downpour of mine, and then sent a dozen shafts by which I<br>consumed those fierce-looking dozen darts of Rama. Then, O king, the<br>high-souled son of Jamadagni showered on me numerous fierce-looking<br>darts, furnished with variegated handles decked with gold, possessed of<br>golden wings, and resembling flaming meteors! Baffling those fierce darts<br>by means of my shield and sword, and causing them in that combat to fall<br>down on the ground, I then, with clouds of excellent arrows, covered<br>Rama's excellent steeds and his charioteer. Then that high-souled smiter<br>of the lord of the Haihayas,[19] beholding those darts of mine equipped<br>with gold-decked handles and resembling snakes emerged out of their<br>holes, and filled with wrath at the sight, had recourse once more to<br>celestial weapons! Then swarms of fierce arrows, looking like flights of<br>locusts fell upon me and overwhelmed me, my steeds, my charioteer, and my<br>car! Indeed, O king, my car, horses, and charioteer, were covered all<br>over with those arrows! And the yoke, shaft, wheels, and the wheel-spokes<br>of my car, overwhelmed with that arrowy shower, at once broke. After that<br>arrowy shower, however, was over, I also covered my preceptor with a<br>thick shower of arrows. Thereupon, that mass of Brahmic merit, mangled<br>with that arrowy downpour, began to bleed copiously, and continuously.<br>Indeed, like Rama afflicted with my clouds of arrows, I too was densely<br>pierced with his arrows. When at last in the evening, the sun set behind<br>the western hills, our combat came to an end.'"
