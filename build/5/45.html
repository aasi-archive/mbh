                            "Sanat-sujata said, 'Sorrow, anger, covetousness, lust, ignorance,<br>laziness, malice, self-importance, continuous desire of gain, affection,<br>jealousy and evil speech,&#8212;these twelve, O monarch, are grave faults that<br>are destructive of men's lives. Each of these, O monarch, wait for<br>opportunities to seize mankind. Afflicted by them, men lose their senses<br>and commit sinful acts. He that is covetous, he that is fierce, he that<br>is harsh of speech, he that is garrulous, he that is given to nursing<br>anger, he that is boastful,&#8212;these six of wicked disposition, on<br>obtaining wealth, cannot treat others with courtesy. He that regardeth<br>sensual gratification as the end of life, he that is self-conceited, he<br>that boasteth having made a gift, he that never spendeth, he that is weak<br>in mind, he that is given to self-admiration, and he that hateth his own<br>wife,&#8212;these seven are counted as wicked men of sinful habits.<br>Righteousness, truth, asceticism, self-restraint, contentment, modesty,<br>renunciation, love of others, gift, acquaintance with the scriptures,<br>patience, and forgiveness,&#8212;these twelve are the practices of a Brahmana.<br>He that doth not fall off from these twelve, may sway the entire earth.<br>He that is endued with three, or two, or even one, of these, doth never<br>regard anything as his own to the exclusion of others. Self-restraint,<br>renunciation, and knowledge,&#8212;in these reside emancipation. These are the<br>attributes of Brahmanas endued with wisdom and regarding Brahman as the<br>highest of all objects of attainment. True or false, it is not laudable<br>for a Brahmana to speak ill of others; they that do this have hell for<br>their abode. Mada hath eighteen faults which have not yet been enumerated<br>by me. They are ill-will towards others, throwing obstacles in the way of<br>virtuous acts, detraction, falsehood in speech, lust, anger, dependence,<br>speaking ill of others, finding out the faults of others for report,<br>waste of wealth, quarrel, insolence, cruelty to living creatures, malice,<br>ignorance, disregard of those that are worthy of regard, loss of the<br>senses of right and wrong, and always seeking to injure others. A wise<br>man, therefore, should not give way to mada, for the accompaniments of<br>mada are censurable. Friendship is said to possess six indications;<br>firstly, friends delight in the prosperity of friends, and secondly, are<br>distressed at their adversity. If any one asketh for anything which is<br>dear to his heart, but which should not be asked for, a true friend<br>surely giveth away even that. Fourthly, a true friend who is of a<br>righteous disposition, when asked, can give away his very prosperity, his<br>beloved sons, and even his own wife. Fifthly, a friend should not dwell<br>in the house of a friend, on whom he may have bestowed everything, but<br>should enjoy what he earneth himself. Sixthly, a friend stoppeth not to<br>sacrifice his own good (for his friend). The man of wealth who seeketh to<br>acquire those good qualities, and who becometh charitable and righteous<br>restraineth his five senses from their respective objects. Such restraint<br>of the senses is asceticism. When it groweth in degree, it is capable of<br>winning regions of bliss hereafter (unlike Knowledge which leadeth to<br>success even here). They that have fallen off from patience (and are<br>incapable, therefore, of attaining to Knowledge) acquire such asceticism<br>in consequence of the purpose they entertain, viz., the attainment of<br>bliss in the high regions hereafter. In consequence of his ability to<br>grasp that Truth (Brahman) from which sacrifices flow, the Yogin is<br>capable of performing sacrifices by the mind. Another performeth<br>sacrifices by Words (Yapa) and another by Work. Truth (Brahman) resides<br>in him who knoweth Brahman as vested with attributes. It dwelleth more<br>completely in him who knoweth Brahman as divested of attributes. Listen<br>now to something else from me. This high and celebrated philosophy should<br>be taught (to disciples). All other systems are only a farrago of words.<br>The whole of this (universe) is established in this Yoga-philosophy. They<br>that are acquainted with it are not subjected to death. O king, one<br>cannot, by Work, however well-accomplished, attain to Truth (Brahman).<br>The man that is destitute of knowledge even if he poureth homa libations<br>or performeth sacrifices, can never, by Work, O king, attain to<br>immortality (emancipation). Nor doth he enjoy great happiness at the end.<br>Restraining all the external senses and alone, one should seek Brahman.<br>Giving up Work, one should not exert mentally. One should also (while<br>thus engaged) avoid experiencing joy at praise or anger at blame. O<br>Kshatriya, by conducting himself in this way according to the successive<br>steps indicated in the Vedas, one may, even here, attain to Brahman.<br>This, O learned one, is all that I tell thee.'"
