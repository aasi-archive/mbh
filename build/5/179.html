                            "Akritavrana said, 'Of these two afflictions of thine, for which, O<br>blessed lady, dost thou seek a remedy? Tell me this. Is it thy wish that<br>the lord of Saubha should be urged to wed thee, the high-souled Rama will<br>certainly urge him from desire of doing thee good? Or, if thou wishest to<br>behold Ganga's son, Bhishma, defeated in battle by intelligent Rama<br>Bhargava will gratify even that wish of thine. Hearing what Srinjaya has<br>to say, and what thou also, O thou of sweet smiles, may have to say, let<br>that be settled this very day what should be done for thee.' Hearing<br>these words, Amva said, 'O holy one, abducted I was by Bhishma acting<br>from ignorance, for, O regenerate one, Bhishma knew not that my heart had<br>been given away to Salwa. Thinking of this in thy mind, let that be<br>resolved upon by thee which is consistent with justice, and let steps be<br>taken for accomplishing that resolution. Do that, O Brahmana, which is<br>proper to be done towards either that tiger among the Kurus, viz.,<br>Bhishma, singly, or towards the ruler of the Salwas, or towards both of<br>them! I have told thee truly about the root of my grief. It behoveth<br>thee, O holy one, to do that which is consistent with reason.'<br><br>"Akritavrana said, 'This, O blessed lady, O thou of the fairest<br>complexion, that thou sayest with eyes fixed upon virtue, is, indeed,<br>worthy of thee. Listen, however, to what I say! If Ganga's son had never<br>taken thee to the city called after the elephant, then, O timid girl,<br>Salwa would have, at Rama's behest, taken thee on his head! It is because<br>Bhishma bore thee away by force that king Salwa's suspicions have been<br>awakened in respect of thee, O thou of slender-waist! Bhishma is proud of<br>his manliness and is crowned with success. Therefore, thou shouldst cause<br>thy vengeance to fall upon Bhishma (and no other)!' Hearing these words<br>of the sage, Amva said, 'O regenerate one, this desire hath been<br>cherished by me also in my heart, viz., that, if possible. Bhishma should<br>be caused by me to be slain in battle! O thou of mighty arms, be it<br>Bhishma or be it king Salwa, punish that man whom thou thinkest to be<br>guilty and through whose act I have been so miserable!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'In conversation such as this, that day passed and<br>the night also, O best of Bharata's race, with its delicious breeze which<br>was neither cold nor hot. Then Rama appeared there, beaming with energy.<br>And that sage wearing matted-locks on his bead and attired in deer-skins<br>was surrounded by his disciples. And endued with magnanimous soul, he had<br>his bow in hand. And bearing also a sword and a battle-axe, that sinless<br>one, O tiger among kings, approached the Srinjaya king (Hotravahana) in<br>that forest. And the ascetics dwelling there and that king also who was<br>endued with great ascetic merit, beholding him, all stood up and waited,<br>O king, with joined hands. And that helpless maiden too did the same. And<br>they all cheerfully worshipped Bhargava with the offer of honey and<br>curds. Being worshipped duly by them, Rama sat with them seated round<br>him. Then, O Bharata, Jamadagni's son and Hotravahana, seated thus<br>together, began to discourse. And after their discourse was over, the<br>sage Hotravahana opportunately said in a sweet voice these words of grave<br>import unto that foremost one of Bhrigu's race, viz., Rama of mighty<br>strength, 'O Rama, this is my daughter's daughter, O lord, being the<br>daughter of the king of Kasi.<br><br>She hath something to be done for her! Oh, listen to it duly, O thou that<br>art skilled in all tasks!' Hearing these words of his friend, Rama<br>addressed that maiden saying. 'Tell me what thou hast to say.' At these<br>words, Amva approached Rama who resembled a blazing fire, and worshipping<br>both his feet with her bent head, touched them with her two hands that<br>resembled, in radiance, a couple of lotuses and stood silently before<br>him. And filled with grief, she wept aloud, her eyes bathed in tears. And<br>she then sought the protection of that descendant of Bhrigu, who was the<br>refuge of all distressed persons. And Rama said, 'Tell me what grief is<br>in thy heart. I will act according to thy words!' Thus encouraged, Amva<br>said, 'O thou of great vows, O holy one, today I seek thy protection! O<br>lord, raise me from this unfathomable ocean of sorrow.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Beholding her beauty and her youthful body and its<br>great delicacy, Rama began to think,&#8212;What will she say? And that<br>perpetuator of Bhrigu's line, thinking inwardly of this, sat long in<br>silence, filled with pity. He then addressed that maiden of sweet smiles<br>again, saying, 'Tell us what thou hast to say!' Thus encouraged, she<br>represented everything truly unto Bhargava. And Jamadagni's son, hearing<br>these words of the princess, and having first settled what he should do,<br>addressed that damsel of the fairest complexion, saying, 'O beautiful<br>lady, I will send word unto Bhishma, that foremost one of Kuru's race.<br>Having beard what my behest is, that king will certainly obey it. If,<br>however, the son of Jahnavi do not act according to my words, I will then<br>consume him in battle, O blessed girl, with all his counsellors! Or, O<br>princess, if thou desirest it, I may even address the heroic ruler of the<br>Salwas to the matter in hand.' Hearing these words of Rama, Amva said,<br>'Dismissed I was by Bhishma, O son of Bhrigu's race, as soon as he heard<br>that my heart had previously been freely given away to the ruler of the<br>Salwas. Approaching then the lord of Saubha, I addressed him in language<br>that was unbecoming. Doubtful of the purity of my conduct, he refused to<br>accept me. Reflecting on all this, with the aid of thy own understanding,<br>it behoveth thee, O son of Bhrigu's race, to do that which should be done<br>in view of these circumstances. Bhishma, however, of great vows is the<br>root of my calamity, for he brought me under his power taking me up (on<br>his car) by violence! Slay that Bhishma, O thou of mighty arms, for whose<br>sake, O tiger of Bhrigu's race, overwhelmed with such distress, I suffer<br>such poignant misery! Bhishma, O thou of Bhrigu's race, is covetous, and<br>mean, and proud of his victory. Therefore, O sinless one, thou shouldst<br>give him his deserts. While, of lord, I was being abducted by him, even<br>this was the desire that I cherished in my heart, viz., that I should<br>cause that hero of great vows to be slain. Therefore, O sinless Rama,<br>gratify this desire of mine! O thou of mighty arms, slay Bhishma, even as<br>Purandara slew Vritra.'"
