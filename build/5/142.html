                            "Sanjaya said, 'Hearing these words of Karna, Kesava, that slayer of<br>hostile heroes, spoke unto him these words smilingly, 'Do not the means<br>of winning an empire recommend themselves to thee. O Karna? Wishest thou<br>not to rule over the whole earth given by me to thee? The victory of the<br>Pandavas, therefore, is very certain. There seems to be no doubt in this.<br>The triumphal banner of Pandu's son, with the fierce ape on it, seems to<br>be already set up. The divine artificer, Bhaumana, hath applied such<br>celestial illusion (in its construction) that it standeth high, displayed<br>like Indra's banner. Various celestial creatures of terrific shape,<br>indicating victory, are seen on that standard. Extending for a yojana<br>upwards and all around, that beautiful standard of Arjuna, resembling<br>fire in radiance, is never, O Karna, when set up, obstructed by hills or<br>trees. When thou wilt behold in battle Arjuna, on his car drawn by white<br>steeds and driven by Krishna, applying Aindra, Agneya and Maruta weapons,<br>and when thou wilt hear the twang of Gandiva piercing the welkin like the<br>very thunder, then all signs of the Krita, the Treta, and the Dwapara<br>ages will disappear (but, instead, Kali embodied will be present). When<br>thou wilt behold in battle Kunti's son, invincible Yudhishthira, devoted<br>to Yapa and Homa and resembling the very sun in brilliance, protecting<br>his own mighty army and burning the army of his foes, then all signs of<br>the Krita, the Treta, and the Dwapara ages will disappear. When thou wilt<br>behold in battle the mighty Bhimasena dancing, after having quaffed the<br>blood of Dussasana, like a fierce elephant with rent temples after having<br>killed a mighty antagonist, then all signs of the Krita, the Treta, and<br>the Dwapara ages will disappear. When thou wilt behold in battle Arjuna<br>checking Drona and Santanu's son and Kripa and king Suyodhana, and<br>Jayadratha of Sindhu's race, all rushing fiercely to the encounter, then<br>all signs of the Krita, the Treta and the Dwapara ages will disappear.<br>When thou wilt behold in battle the two mighty sons of Madri,&#8212;those<br>heroic car-warriors, capable of breaking into pieces all hostile<br>cars,&#8212;agitating, from the very moment when weapons will begin to clash,<br>the army of Dhritarashtra's sons like a couple of infuriated elephants,<br>then all signs of the Krita, the Treta and the Dwapara ages will<br>disappear. Returning hence, O Karna, say unto Drona and Santanu's son and<br>Kripa that the present month is a delightful one, and that food, drink,<br>and fuel are abundant now. All plants and herbs are vigorous now, all<br>trees full of fruits, and flies there are none. The roads are free from<br>mire, and the waters are of agreeable taste. The weather is neither very<br>hot nor very cold and is, therefore, highly pleasant. Seven days after,<br>will be the day of the new moon. Let the battle commence then, for that<br>day, it hath been said, is presided over by Indra. Say also unto all the<br>kings that have come for battling that I will fully accomplish the desire<br>cherished by them. Indeed, all the kings and princes that are obedient to<br>the orders of Duryodhana, obtaining death by weapons, will attain to an<br>excellent state.'"
