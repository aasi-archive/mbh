                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing these words from Bhima, that were fraught<br>with such mildness and that were, as unexpected as if the hills had lost<br>their weight and fire had become cold, Rama's younger brother Kesava of<br>Sura's race and mighty arms, wielding the bow called Saranga, laughed<br>aloud, and as if to stimulate Bhima by his words, like the breeze fanning<br>a fire, addressed him who was then so overwhelmed by the impulse of<br>kindness, saying, 'At other times, O Bhimasena, thou applaudest war only,<br>desirous of crushing the wicked sons of Dhritarashtra that take delight<br>in the destruction of others. O chastiser of foes, thou dost not steep<br>but wakest the whole night, sitting up face downwards. Thou often<br>utterest frightful exclamation of wrath, indicative of the storm within<br>thy heart. Inflamed with the fire of thy own fury, thou sighest, O Bhima<br>with an unquiet heart, like a flame of fire mixed with smoke. Withdrawing<br>from company thou liest down breathing hot sighs, like a weak man pressed<br>down by a heavy load. They, who do not know the cause regard thee as<br>insane. As an elephant breaking into fragments uprooted trees lying on<br>the ground grunteth in rage while trampling them under his feet, so thou<br>also, O Bhima, runnest on, breathing deep sighs and shaking the earth<br>under the tread. Here in the region thou takest no delight in company but<br>passest thy time in privacy. Night or day, Nothing pleases thee so much<br>as seclusion. Sitting apart thou sometimes laughest aloud all on a<br>sudden, and sometimes placing thy head between thy two knees, thou<br>continuest in that posture for a long time with closed eyes. At the other<br>times, O Bhima, contracting thy brows frequently and biting thy lips,<br>thou starest fiercely before thee. All this is indicative of wrath. At<br>one time, thou hadst, in the midst of thy brothers, grasped the mace,<br>uttering this oath, 'As the sun is seen rising in the east displaying his<br>radiance, and as he truly setteth in the west journeying around the Meru,<br>so do I swear that I will certainly slay insolent Duryodhana with this<br>mace of mine, and this oath of mine will never be untrue.' How then doth<br>that same heart of thine, O chastiser of foes, now follow the counsels of<br>peace? Alas, when fear entereth thy heart, O Bhima, it is certain that<br>the hearts of all who desire war are upset when war becometh actually<br>imminent. Asleep or awake, thou beholdest, O son of Pritha, inauspicious<br>omens. Perhaps, it is this for which thou desirest peace. Alas, like a<br>eunuch, thou dost not display any sign indicative of manliness in thee.<br>Thou art overwhelmed by panic, and it is for this that thy heart is<br>upset. The heart trembleth, thy mind is overwhelmed by despair, thy<br>thighs tremble, and it is for this that thou desirest peace. The hearts<br>of mortals, O Partha, are surely as inconstant as the pods of the Salmali<br>seed exposed to the force of the wind. This frame of thy mind is as<br>strange as articulate speech in kine. Indeed, the hearts of thy brothers<br>are about to sink in an ocean of despair,&#8212;like swimmers in the sea<br>without a raft to rescue them. That thou, O Bhimasena, shouldst utter<br>words so unexpected of thee is as strange as the shifting of a hill.<br>Recollecting thy own deeds and the race also in which thou art born,<br>arise, O Bharata, yield not, to grief, O hero, and be firm. Such langour,<br>O repressor of foes, is not worthy of thee, for a Kshatriya never<br>enjoyeth that which he doth not acquire through prowess.'"
