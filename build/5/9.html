                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O foremost of monarchs, I wish to know how it was<br>that great and unparalleled misery had to be endured by the illustrious<br>Indra together with his queen.'<br><br>"Salya said, 'Listen, O king, to me as I relate this ancient story of the<br>events of former days,&#8212;how, O descendant of Bharata, misery befell Indra<br>and his wife. Once Twashtri, the lord of creatures and the foremost of<br>celestials, was engaged in practising rigid austerities. And it is said<br>that from antipathy to Indra he created a son having three heads. And<br>that being of universal form possessed of great lustre hankered after<br>Indra's seat. And possessed of those three awful faces resembling the<br>sun, the moon, and the fire, he read the Vedas with one mouth, drank wine<br>with another, and looked with the third as if he would absorb all the<br>cardinal points. And given to the practice of austerities, and mild being<br>and self-controlled, he was intent upon a life of religious practices and<br>austerities. And his practice of austerities, O subduer of foes, was<br>rigid and terrible and of an exceedingly severe character. And beholding<br>the austerities, courage, and truthfulness of this one possessed of<br>immeasurable energy, Indra became anxious, fearing lest that being should<br>take his place. And Indra reflected, 'How may he be made to addict<br>himself to sensual enjoyments; how may he be made to cease his practice<br>of such rigid austerities? For were the three-headed being to wax strong,<br>he would absorb the whole universe.' And it was thus that Indra pondered<br>in his mind; and, O best of Bharata's race, endued with intelligence, he<br>ordered the celestial nymphs to tempt the son of Twashtri. And he<br>commanded them, saying, 'Be quick, and go without delay, and so tempt him<br>that the three-headed being may plunge himself into sensual enjoyment to<br>the utmost extent. Furnished with captivating hips, array yourselves in<br>voluptuous attires, and decking yourselves in charming necklaces, do ye<br>display gestures and blandishments of love. Endued with loveliness, do ye<br>tempt him and alleviate my dread. I feel restless in my heart, O lovely<br>damsels. Avert ye, ladies, this awful peril that hangs over me. Good<br>betide you.'<br><br>"Then the nymphs said, 'O Indra, O slayer of Vala, we shall so endeavour<br>to allure him that thou wilt have nothing to fear at his hands. That very<br>receptacle of austerities, sitting now as if scorching everything with<br>his eyes, O god, we are going together to tempt. We shall try to bring<br>him under our control, and to put an end to your fears.'<br><br>"Salya continued, 'Commanded by Indra, they then went to the three-headed<br>being. And arriving there, those lovely damsels tempted him with various<br>gestures of love, displaying their fine figures. But engaged in the<br>practice of exceedingly severe austerities, although he looked at them,<br>yet he was not influenced by desire. Of subdued senses he was like the<br>ocean, full to the brim, in gravity. And the nymphs after having tried<br>their best, came back to Indra. And they all with joined hands spoke to<br>the lord of the celestials, saying, 'O, that unapproachable being is<br>incapable of being disturbed by us. O highly gifted being, thou mayst do<br>what now may seem proper to thee.' The high-minded Indra honoured the<br>nymphs and then dismissed them reflecting, O Yudhishthira, solely upon<br>other means of destroying his foe. And endued with intelligence, he fixed<br>upon a contrivance for destroying the three-headed being. And he said,<br>'Let me today hurt my thunderbolt at him. By this means he will speedily<br>be killed. Even a strong person should not overlook a rising foe,<br>contemptible though he may be.' And thus reflecting upon the lessons<br>inculcated in treatises of learning, he was firmly resolved upon slaying<br>that being. Then Indra, enraged, hurled at the three-headed being his<br>thunderbolt which looked like fire and was terrible to behold, and which<br>inspired dread. And forcibly struck by that thunderbolt, he was slain and<br>fell down, as falls on the earth the loosened summit of a hill. And<br>beholding him slain by the thunderbolt, and lying down huge as a hill,<br>the chief of the celestials found no peace, and felt as if scorched by<br>the effulgent appearance of the dead; for though slain, he had a blazing<br>and effulgent appearance and looked like one alive. And, strange to say,<br>though lifeless, his heads seemed to be alive as they were beheld lying<br>low on the field. And exceedingly afraid of that lustre, Indra remained<br>plunged in thought. And at that time, O great king, bearing an axe on his<br>shoulder, a carpenter came to the forest and approached the spot where<br>lay that being. And Indra, the lord of Sachi, who was afraid, saw the<br>carpenter come there by chance. And the chastiser of Paka said unto him<br>immediately, 'Do this my behest. Quickly cut off this one's heads.' The<br>carpenter thereupon said, 'His shoulders are broad: this axe will not be<br>able to cut them off. Nor shall I be able to do what is condemned by<br>righteous persons.' And Indra said, 'Do not fear, quickly do what I say.<br>At my command thy axe shall equal the thunderbolt.' The carpenter said,<br>'Whom am I to take thee to be who hast done this frightful deed today?<br>This I wish to learn, tell me the exact truth.' And Indra said, 'O<br>carpenter, I am Indra, the chief of the gods. Let this be known to thee.<br>Do thou act just as I have told thee. Do not hesitate, O carpenter! The<br>carpenter said, 'O Indra, how is it that thou art not ashamed of this thy<br>inhuman act? How it is that thou hast no dread of the sin of slaying a<br>Brahmana, after having slain this son of a saint?' Indra said, 'I shall<br>afterwards perform some religious ceremony of a rigorous kind to purify<br>myself from this taint. This was a powerful enemy of mine whom I have<br>killed with my thunderbolt. Even now I am uneasy, O carpenter; I, indeed,<br>dread him even now. Do thou quickly cut off his heads, I shall bestow my<br>favour upon thee. In sacrifices, men will give thee the head of the<br>sacrificial beast as thy share. This is the favour I confer on thee. Do<br>thou quickly perform what I desire.'<br><br>"Salya said, 'Hearing this, the carpenter, at the request of the great<br>Indra, immediately severed the heads of the three-headed one with his<br>axe. And when the heads were cut off, out flew therefrom a number of<br>birds, viz., partridges, quails and sparrows. And from the mouth<br>wherewith he used to recite the Vedas and to drink the Soma-juice, came<br>out partridges in quick succession. And, O king, O son of Pandu, from the<br>mouth with which he used to look at the cardinal points as if absorbing<br>them all, a number of quails came forth. And from that mouth of the<br>three-headed being which used to drink wine, out flew a number of<br>sparrows and hawks. And the heads having been cut off Indra was freed<br>from his trepidation, and went to heaven, glad at heart. And the<br>carpenter also went back to his house. And the slayer of Asuras, having<br>killed his foe, considered his object gained. Now when the lord of<br>creatures, Twashtri, heard that his son had been slain by Indra, his eyes<br>became red with ire, and he spoke the following words, 'Since Indra hath<br>killed my son who had committed no offence at all, who was constantly<br>engaged in the practice of austerities, who was merciful, possessed of<br>self-control, and of subdued passions, therefore, for the destruction of<br>Indra, I will create Vritra. Let the worlds behold what power I possess,<br>and how mighty is the practice of austerities! Let that inhuman,<br>wicked-minded lord of the gods also witness the same!' And saying this,<br>that enraged one, famous for his austerities, washed his mouth with<br>water, made offerings on the fire, created the terrible Vritra, and spoke<br>to him, saying, 'O destined slayer of Indra, grow in might even from the<br>strength of my austere rites.' And that Asura grew in might, towering<br>towards the firmament, and resembling the son of fire. And he asked,<br>'Risen like the doomsday sun, what am I to do?' 'Kill Indra,' was the<br>reply. And then he departed towards the celestial regions. And next<br>ensued a great fight between Vritra and Indra, both fired with wrath. And<br>there took place a terrible combat, O best of Kuru's race. And the heroic<br>Vritra seized the celestial lord who had performed a hundred sacrifices.<br>And filled with wrath, he whirled Indra and threw him into his mouth. And<br>when Indra was swallowed up by Vritra, the terrified senior gods,<br>possessed of great might, created Jrimbhika to kill Vritra. And as Vritra<br>yawned and his mouth opened the slayer of the Asura, Vala contracted the<br>different parts of his body, and came out from within Vritra's mouth. And<br>thenceforth the yawn attaches itself to the living breath of animated<br>beings in three worlds. And the gods rejoiced at the egress of Indra. And<br>once again commenced the terrible fight between Vritra and Indra, both<br>full of ire. And it was waged for a long while, O best of Bharata's race.<br>And when Vritra, inspired with the mighty spirit of Twashtri and himself<br>endowed with strength, got the upper hand in fight, Indra turned back And<br>on his retreat, the gods became exceedingly distressed. And all of them<br>together with Indra were overpowered by the might of Twashtri. And they<br>all consulted with the saints, O descendant of Bharata. And they<br>deliberated as to what was proper to be done, and were overwhelmed with<br>dread. And seated on the top of the Mandara mountain, and bent on killing<br>Vritra, they only bethought themselves of Vishnu, the indestructible one.'
