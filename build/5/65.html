                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Consider, O Duryodhana, O dear son, what I tell<br>thee. Like an ignorant traveller thou thinkest, the wrong path to be the<br>right one, since thou art desirous of robbing the energy of the five sons<br>of Pandu, who are even as the five elements of the universe in their<br>subtle form upholding all mobile and immobile things. Without the certain<br>sacrifice of thy life thou art unable to vanquish Yudhishthira, the son<br>of Kunti, who is the foremost of all virtuous persons in this world.<br>Alas, like a tree defying the mighty tempest, thou chafest at Bhimasena<br>who hath not his peer (among men) in might and who is equal unto Yama<br>himself in battle. What man of sense would encounter in battle the<br>wielder of Gandiva, who is the foremost of all wielders of weapons, as<br>the Meru among mountains? What man is there whom Dhrishtadyumna, the<br>prince of Panchala, cannot overthrow, shooting his arrows among the foes,<br>like the chief of the celestials hurling his thunderbolt? That honoured<br>warrior among the Andhakas and the Vrishnis, the irresistible Satyaki,<br>ever engaged in the good of the Pandavas, will also slaughter thy host.<br>What man of sense, again, would encounter the lotus-eyed Krishna, who, as<br>regards the measure of his energy and power, surpasseth the three worlds?<br>As regards Krishna, his wives, kinsmen, relatives, his own soul and the<br>whole earth, put on one scale, weigheth with Dhananjaya on the other.<br>That Vasudeva, upon whom Arjuna relieth, is irresistible, and that host<br>where Kesava is, becometh irresistible everywhere. Listen, therefore, O<br>child, to the counsels of those well-wishers of thine whose words are<br>always for thy good. Accept thou thy aged grandsire, Bhishma, the son of<br>Santanu, as thy guide. Listen thou to what I say, and what these<br>well-wishers of the Kurus, Drona, and Kripa, and Vikarna, and king<br>Vahlika say. These all are as I myself. It behoveth thee to regard them<br>as much as thou regardest me, since, O Bharata, all these are conversant<br>with morality and bear affection to thee as much as I myself do. The<br>panic and rout, before thy eyes, at the city of Virata, of all thy troops<br>with thy brothers, after surrender of the king,&#8212;indeed, that wonderful<br>story that is heard of an encounter at that city between one and many,<br>are sufficient proof (of the wisdom of what I say). When Arjuna singly<br>achieves all that, what will not the Pandavas achieve when united<br>together? Take them by the hands as thy brothers, and cherish them with a<br>share of the kingdom.'"
