                            "Vidula said, 'If, having fallen into such a plight, thou wishest to give<br>up manliness, thou shalt then have, in no time, to tread the path that is<br>trod by those that are low and wretched. That Kshatriya, who, from desire<br>of life, displayeth not his energy according to the best of his might and<br>prowess, is regarded as a thief. Alas, like medicine to a dying man,<br>these words that are fraught with grave import, and are proper and<br>reasonable, do not make any impression on thee! It is true, the king of<br>the Sindhus hath many followers. They are, however, all discounted. From<br>weakness, and ignorance of proper means, they are waiting for the<br>distress of their master (without being able to effect a deliverance for<br>themselves by their own exertions). As regards others (his open enemies),<br>they will come to thee with their auxiliaries if they behold thee put<br>forth thy prowess. Uniting with them, seek refuge now in mountain<br>fastness, waiting for that season when calamity will overtake the foe, as<br>it must, for he is not free from disease and death. By name thou art<br>Sanjaya (the victorious). I do not, however, behold any such indication<br>in thee. Be true to thy name. Be my son. Oh, do not make thy name untrue.<br>Beholding thee while a child, a Brahmana of great foresight and wisdom,<br>said, 'This one falling into great distress will again win greatness.'<br>Remembering his words, I hope for thy victory. It is for that, O son, I<br>tell thee so, and shall tell thee again and again. That man who pursueth<br>the fruition of his objects according to the ways of policy and for the<br>success of whose objects other people strive cordially, is always sure to<br>win success. Whether what I have is gained or lost, I will not desist,<br>with such a resolve, O Sanjaya, O learned one, engage in war, without<br>withdrawing thyself from it. Samvara hath said, 'There is no more<br>miserable state than that in which one is anxious for his food from day<br>to day.' A state such as his hath beer said to be more unhappy than the<br>death of one's husband and sons. That which hath been called poverty is<br>only a form of death. As regards myself, born in a high race, I have been<br>transplanted from one take into another. Possessed of every auspicious<br>thing, and worshipped by my husband, my power extended over all. Staying<br>in the midst of friends, our friends formerly beheld me decked in costly<br>garlands and ornaments, with body well-washed, attired in excellent<br>robes, and myself always cheerful. When thou wilt behold both me and thy<br>wife weakened (from want of food), thou wilt then, O Sanjaya, scarcely<br>desire to live. Of what use will life be to thee when thou wilt behold<br>all our servants engaged in attending on us, our preceptors and our<br>ordinary and extraordinary priests, leaving us from want of sustenance?<br>If, again, I do not now see in thee those laudable and famous<br>achievements in which thou wert formerly engaged, what peace can my heart<br>know? If I have to say&#8212;Nay&#8212;to a Brahmana, my heart will burst, for<br>neither I nor my husband ever said&#8212;Nay&#8212;to a Brahmana before. We were<br>the refuge of others, without ourselves having ever taken refuge with<br>others. Having been such, if I have to support life by depending on<br>another, I will surely cast off my life. Be thou our means of crossing<br>the ocean that is difficult to cross. In the absence of boats, be thou<br>our boat. Make for us a place where place there is none. Revive us that<br>are dead. Thou art competent to encounter all foes if thou dost not<br>cherish the desire of life. If, however, thou art for adopting this mode<br>of life that is fit only for a eunuch, then with troubled soul and<br>depressed heart it would be better for thee to sacrifice thy life. A<br>brave man winneth fame by slaying even a single foe. By slaying Vritra,<br>Indra became the great Indra and acquired the sovereignty of all the gods<br>and the cup for drinking Soma, and the lordship of all the worlds.<br>Proclaiming his name in battle, challenging his foes accoutred in steel,<br>and grinding or slaying the foremost warriors of hostile ranks, when a<br>hero winneth far-extending fame in fair fight, his enemies then are<br>pained and bow down unto him. They that are cowards become helpless and<br>contribute by their own conduct to bestow every object of desire on those<br>that are skilled and brave and that fight reckless of their lives.<br>Whether kingdoms be overtaken by mighty ruin, or whether life itself be<br>endangered, they that are noble never desist till they exterminate the<br>foes within their reach. Sovereignty is either the door of heaven or<br>Amrita. Regarding it as one of these, and bearing it in mind that is now<br>shut against thee, fall thou like a burning brand in the midst of thy<br>foes. O king, slay thy foes in battle. Observe the duties of thy order.<br>Let me not behold thee cheerless, O enhancer of the fears of thy foes.<br>Let me not in dejection behold thee standing in misery, surrounded by our<br>sorrowing selves and rejoicing foes. Rejoice, O son, and make thyself<br>happy in the possession of wealth in the company of the daughters of the<br>Sauviras and do not, in weakness of heart, be ruled over by the daughters<br>of the Saindhavas. If a young man like thee, who is possessed of beauty<br>of person, learning and high birth, and world-wide fame, acteth in such<br>unbecoming a way, like a vicious bull in the matter of bearing its<br>burthen, then that, I think, would be equal to death itself. What peace<br>can my heart know if I behold thee uttering laudatory speeches in honour<br>of others or walking (submissively) behind them? Oh, never was one born<br>in this race that walked behind another. O son, it behoveth thee not to<br>live as a dependant on another. I know what the eternal essence of<br>Kshatriya virtues is as spoken of by the old and the older ones and by<br>those coming late and later still. Eternal and unswerving, it hath been<br>ordained by the Creator himself. He that hath, in this world, been born<br>as a Kshatriya in any high race and hath acquired a knowledge of the<br>duties of that order, will never from fear or the sake of sustenance, bow<br>down to any body on earth. One should stand erect with courage and not<br>bow down, for exertion is manliness. One should rather break in the<br>joints than yield in this world here to any body. A high-souled Kshatriya<br>should always roam like an infuriated elephant. He should, O Sanjaya, bow<br>down unto Brahmanas only, for the sake of virtue. He should rule over all<br>other orders, destroying all evil-doers. Possessed of allies, or<br>destitute of them, he should be so as long as he liveth.'"
