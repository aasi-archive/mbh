                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing the peaceful words of the king that were<br>fraught with both virtue and profit, king Drupada's daughter Krishna, of<br>long black tresses, afflicted with great grief, applauding Sahadeva and<br>that mighty car-warrior Satyaki, addressed Madhava seated by his side.<br>And beholding Bhimasena declare for peace, that intelligent lady,<br>overwhelmed with woe and with eyes bathed in tears, said, 'O slayer of<br>Madhu, it is known to thee, O thou of mighty arms, by what deceitful<br>means, O righteous one, the son of Dhritarashtra with his counsellors<br>robbed the Pandavas, O Janardana. of their happiness. Thou knowest also,<br>O thou of Dasarha's race, what message was privately delivered to Sanjaya<br>by the king. Thou hast also heard all that was said unto Sanjaya. O thou<br>of great effulgence, these words were even these, 'Let only five villages<br>be granted to us, viz., Avishthala, and Vrikasthala, and Makandi, and<br>Varanavata, and for the fifth, any other,&#8212;O thou of mighty arms, O<br>Kesava, even this was the message that was to have been delivered to<br>Duryodhana and his counsellors. But, O Krishna, O thou of Dasarha's race,<br>hearing those words of Yudhishthira, endued with modesty and anxious for<br>peace, Suyodhana hath not acted according to them. If, O Krishna,<br>Suyodhana desireth to make peace without surrendering the kingdom, there<br>is no necessity of going thither for making such a peace. The Pandavas<br>with the Srinjayas, O thou of mighty arms, are quite able to withstand<br>the fierce Dhritarashtra host inflamed with rage. When they are no longer<br>amenable to this arts of conciliation, it is not proper, O slayer of<br>Madhu, that thou shouldst show them mercy. Those enemies, O Krishna, with<br>whom peace cannot be established by either conciliation or presents,<br>should be treated with severity by one desirous of saving his life.<br>Therefore, O mighty-armed Achyuta, heavy should be the punishment that<br>deserves to be speedily inflicted upon them by thyself aided by the<br>Pandavas and the Srinjayas. Indeed, even this would become the son of<br>Pritha, and add to thy glory, and if accomplished, will, O Krishna, be a<br>source of great happiness to the whole Kshatriya race. He that is<br>covetous, whether belonging to the Kshatriya or any other order, save of<br>course a Brahmana, even if most sinful, ought surely to be slain by a<br>Kshatriya, who is true to the duties of his own order. The exception in<br>the case of a Brahmana, O sire, is due to a Brahmana's being the<br>preceptor of all the other orders, as also the first sharer of<br>everything. Persons conversant with the scriptures declare, O Janardana,<br>that sin is incurred in slaying one that deserveth not to be slain. So<br>there is equal sin in not slaying one that deserveth to be slain. Act<br>thou, therefore, O Krishna, in such a way with the forces of the Pandavas<br>and the Srinjayas, that sin may not touch thee. From excess of confidence<br>in thee, O Janardana, I will repeat what hath been said again and again.<br>Whatever woman, O Kesava, is there on earth like me? I am the daughter of<br>king Drupada, risen from the sacrificial alter. I am the sister of<br>Dhrishtadyumna, thy dear friend, O Krishna. I have by marriage become a<br>lady of Ajamida's race,&#8212;the daughter-in-law of the illustrious Pandu. I<br>am the queen of Pandu's sons, who resemble five Indras in splendour. I<br>have, by these five heroes, five sons that are all mighty car-warriors,<br>and that are morally bound to thee, O Krishna, as Abhimanyu himself.<br>Being such, O Krishna, I was seized by the hair, dragged into the<br>assembly and insulted in the very sight of the sons of Pandu and in thy<br>life-time. O Kesava, the sons of Pandu, the Panchalas, and the Vrishnis<br>being all alive, exposed to the gaze of the assembly I was treated as a<br>slave by those sinful wretches. And when the Pandavas beholding it all<br>sat silent without giving way to wrath, in my heart I called upon thee. O<br>Govinda, saying,&#8212;Save me, O save me!&#8212;Then the illustrious king<br>Dhritarashtra, my father-in-law, said unto me, 'Ask thou any boon, O<br>princess of Panchala. Thou deservest boons and even honour at my hands.'<br>Thus addressed I said, 'Let the Pandavas be free men with their cars and<br>weapons.' Upon this the Pandavas, O Kesava, were freed but only to be<br>exiled into the woods. O Janardana, thou knowest all these sorrows of<br>mine. Rescue me, O lotus-eyed one, with my husbands, kinsmen, and<br>relatives, from that grief. Morally, O Krishna, I am the daughter-in-law<br>of both Bhishma and Dhritarashtra. Though such, I was yet forcibly made a<br>slave. Fie to Partha's bowmanship, oh, fie to Bhimasena's might since<br>Duryodhana, O Krishna, liveth for even a moment. If I deserve any favour<br>at thy hands, if thou hast any compassion for me, let thy wrath, O<br>Krishna, be directed towards the sons of Dhritarashtra.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said this, the beautiful Krishna of eyes<br>that were black in hue and large like lotus leaves, bathed in tears, and<br>walking like a cow-elephant, approached the lotus-eyed Krishna, and<br>taking with her left hand her own beautiful tresses of curly ends,<br>deep-blue in hue and scented with every perfume, endued with every<br>auspicious mark, and though gathered into a braid, yet soft and glossy<br>like a mighty snake, spake these words, 'Lotus-eyed one that art anxious<br>for peace with the enemy, thou shouldst, in all thy acts, call to thy<br>mind these tresses of mine seized by Dussasana's rude hands! If Bhima and<br>Arjuna, O Krishna, have become so low as to long for peace, my aged<br>father then with his war like sons will avenge for me in battle. My five<br>sons also that are endued with great energy, with Abhimanyu, O slayer of<br>Madhu, at their head, will fight with the Kauravas. What peace can this<br>heart of mine know unless I behold Dussasana's dark arm severed from his<br>trunk and pulverised to atoms? Thirteen long years have I passed in<br>expectation of better times, hiding in my heart my wrath like a<br>smouldering fire. And now pierced by Bhima's wordy darts that heart cf<br>mine is about to break, for the mighty-armed Bhima now casteth his eye on<br>morality. Uttering these words with voice choked in tears, the large-eyed<br>Krishna began to weep aloud, with convulsive sobs, and tears gushed down<br>her cheeks. And that lady, with hips full and round, began to drench her<br>close and deep bosom by the tears she shed which were hot as liquid fire.<br>The mighty-armed Kesava then spoke, comforting her in these words, 'Soon<br>wilt thou, O Krishna, behold the ladies of Bharata's race weep as thou<br>dost. Even they, O timid one, will weep like thee, their kinsmen and<br>friends being slain. They with whom, O lady, thou art angry, have their<br>kinsmen and warriors already slain. With Bhima and Arjuna and the twins,<br>at Yudhishthira's command, and agreeably to fate, and what hath been<br>ordained by the Ordainer, I will accomplish all this. Their hour having<br>arrived, the sons of Dhritarashtra, if they do not listen to my words,<br>will surely lie down on the earth turned as morsels of dogs and jackals.<br>The mountains of Himavat might shift their site, the Earth herself might<br>spilt into a hundred fragments, the firmament itself with its myriads of<br>stars might fall down, still my words can never be futile. Stop thy<br>tears, I swear to thee, O Krishna, soon wilt thou see thy husbands, with<br>their enemies slain, and with prosperity crowning them.'"
