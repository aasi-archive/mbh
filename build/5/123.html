                            "Narada said, 'Sent back to heaven by those righteous kings,<br>distinguished by the liberality of their sacrificial presents, Yayati<br>possessed of daughter's sons, dismissed them and reached the celestial<br>regions. Attaining to the eternal region obtained through the merit of<br>his daughter's sons, and adorned by his own deeds, Yayati, bathed in<br>shower of fragrant flowers and hugged by perfumed and delicious breezes,<br>blazed forth with great beauty. And cheerfully, received back into heaven<br>with sounds of cymbals, he was entertained with songs and dances by<br>various tribes of Gandharvas and Asuras. And diverse celestial and royal<br>Rishis and Charanas began to pay their adorations to him. And deities<br>worshipped him with an excellent Arghya and delighted him with other<br>honours. And after he had thus regained heaven and tranquillity of heart,<br>and had once more become freed from anxiety, the Grandsire, gratifying<br>him by his words said, 'Thou hadst earned the full measure I of virtue by<br>thy earthly deeds, and this region (that thou hadst won) is eternal, as<br>thy deeds are in heaven. Thou hadst, however, O royal sage, destroyed thy<br>acquisition by thy vanity alone, and thereby covered the hearts of all<br>the denizens of heaven with darkness in consequence of which none of them<br>could recognise thee. And since thou couldst not be recognised, thou wert<br>hurled hence! Saved once more by the love and affection of thy daughter's<br>sons, thou hast once more arrived here, and regained this unchangeable,<br>eternal, sacred, excellent, stable, and indestructible region won before<br>by thy own deeds.' Thus addressed, Yayati said, 'O holy one, I have a<br>doubt, which, it behoveth thee, to dispel. O Grandsire of all the worlds,<br>it behoveth me not to ask any one else. Great was my merit, augmented by<br>a (virtuous) rule over my subjects for many thousands of years and won by<br>innumerable sacrifices and gifts. How could merit (so great) be exhausted<br>so soon in consequence of which I was hurled hence? Thou knowest, O holy<br>one, that the regions created for me were all eternal. Why were all those<br>regions of mine destroyed, O thou of great effulgence? The Grandsire<br>answered, saying, 'Thy merit, augmented by a (virtuous) rule over thy<br>subjects for many thousands of years and won by innumerable sacrifices<br>and gifts, was exhausted by only one fault, in consequence of which thou<br>wert hurled (from this region). That fault, O king of kings, was thy<br>vanity for which thou hadst become an object of contempt with all the<br>residents of heaven. O royal sage, this region can never be rendered<br>eternal by vanity, or pride of strength, or malice, or deceitfulness, or<br>deception. Never disregard those that are inferior, or superior, or in<br>the middle station. There is not a greater sinner than he who is consumed<br>by the fire of vanity. Those men that will converse upon this fall and<br>re-ascension of thine, will, without doubt, be protected even if<br>overtaken by calamity.'<br><br>"Narada continued, 'O monarch, even such was the distress into which<br>Yayati fell in consequence of vanity, and such was the distress into<br>which Galava fell owing to his obstinacy. They that desire their own good<br>should listen to friends that wish them well. Obstinacy should never be<br>entertained, for obstinacy is always the root of ruin. For this reason, O<br>son of Gandhari, forsake vanity and wrath, O hero, make peace with the<br>sons of Pandu. Avoid anger, O king, that which is given away, that which<br>is done, the austerities that are practised, the libations that are<br>poured on fire, nor one of these is ever destroyed or suffereth any<br>diminution. None else, again, enjoyeth the fruits of these save he that<br>is their agent. He that succeedeth in understanding this truly superior<br>and excellent history, that is approved by persons of great learning as<br>well as by those that are freed from anger and lust, and that is enforced<br>by various references to scriptures and reason, obtaineth a knowledge of<br>virtue and profit and desire, and enjoyeth the sovereignty of the whole<br>world!'"
