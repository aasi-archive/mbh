                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'They say, O Sanjaya, that the Pandavas have arrived<br>at Upaplavya. Go thou and enquire after them. Thou must greet Ajatasatru<br>in the following words, 'By good luck it is that (emerged from the woods)<br>thou hast reached such a city. And to all of them thou must say, O<br>Sanjaya, these words. Are ye well, having spent that harassing period of<br>sojourn, ye who were unworthy of such harassment?' In no time will they<br>be appeased towards us, for though treated treacherously (by foes), yet<br>they are righteous and good. In no case, O Sanjaya, have I ever met with<br>any untruthfulness on the part of the Pandavas. It was by their own<br>valour that they had won all their prosperity, and (yet) they were ever<br>dutiful to me. Though I scrutinized their conduct, I could never find<br>fault with them,&#8212;no, not even a single fault for which we might blame<br>them. They always act mindful of virtue and wealth; they never give way<br>to love of sensual enjoyments, or cold, or hunger, or thirst; they subdue<br>steep and laziness and wrath and joy and heedlessness. The sons of<br>Pritha, mindful of both virtue and wealth, are ever pleasant to all. On<br>proper occasions they part with their wealth to friends. Friendship with<br>them never loses its ardour on account of length of time; for they bestow<br>honours and wealth on every one according to his deserts. Not a soul in<br>the race of Ajamida ever entertains hatred for them excepting this vile,<br>capricious, dull-headed Duryodhana, and excepting also the still more<br>mean-minded Karna. These two always enhance the energy of those<br>high-souled ones who have been divested of both friends and happiness.<br>Enterprising and brought up in every indulgence, Duryodhana reckons all<br>that to be well-done. It is childish on Duryodhana's part to think that<br>it is possible to rob the Pandavas of their just share so long as they<br>are alive. It is wise to yield to Yudhishthira his due share before the<br>war,&#8212;to him whose steps are followed by Arjuna and Krishna and Bhima and<br>Satyaki and the two sons of Madri and the warriors of the Srinjaya race.<br>That wielder of the Gandiva, Savyasachin, seated on his car, would alone<br>be able to devastate the whole world. And likewise the victorious and<br>high-souled Krishna, the lord of the three worlds, incapable of defeat is<br>able to do the same. What mortal would stand before him who is the one<br>worthiest person in all the worlds and who discharges his multitude of<br>arrows that roar like the clouds, covering all sides, like flights of<br>swiftly-coursing locusts? Alone on his car, holding the Gandiva, he had<br>conquered the northern regions as also the Kurus of the north and brought<br>away with him all their wealth. He converted the people of the Dravida<br>land to be a portion of his own army. It was Falguna, the wielder of the<br>Gandiva, who defeating in the Khandava woods all the gods together with<br>Indra, made offerings to Agni, enhancing the honour and fame of the<br>Pandavas. Of all wielders again of the mace, there is none equal to<br>Bhima; and there is none also who is so skilful a rider of elephants. On<br>car, they say, he yields not to even Arjuna; and as to might of arms, he<br>is equal to ten thousand elephants. Well-trained and active, he who hath<br>again been rendered bitterly hostile, would in anger consume the<br>Dhartarashtras in no time. Always wrathful, and strong of arms, he is not<br>capable of being subdued in battle by even Indra himself. Of great heart,<br>and strong, and endued with great lightness of hand, the two (twin)<br>brothers, sons of Madri, carefully trained by Arjuna, would leave not a<br>foe alive, like to a pair of hawks preying upon large flocks of birds.<br>This our army, so full, to tell thee the truth, will be nowhere when it<br>will encounter them. In their side will be Dhrishtadyumna, endued with<br>great activity,&#8212;one who is regarded as one of the Pandavas themselves.<br>The chief of the Somaka tribe, with his followers, is, I have heard, so<br>devoted to the cause of the Pandavas that he is ready to lay down his<br>very life for them. Who would be able to withstand Yudhishthira who hath<br>the best of the Vrishni tribe (Krishna) for his leader? I have heard that<br>Virata, the chief of the Matsyas, with whom the Pandavas had lived for<br>some time and whose wishes were fulfilled by them, old in years, is<br>devoted, along with his sons to the Pandava cause, and hath become an<br>adherent of Yudhishthira. Deposed from the throne of the Kekaya land, and<br>desirous of being reinstated thereon, the five mighty brothers from that<br>land, wielding mighty bows, are now following the sons of Pritha ready to<br>fight. All who are valiant among the lords of the earth have been brought<br>together and are devoted to the Pandava cause. I hear that they are bold,<br>worthy, and respectful,&#8212;they who have allied themselves to the virtuous<br>king Yudhishthira from feelings of attachment to him. And many warriors<br>dwelling on the hills and inaccessible fastnesses, and many that are high<br>in lineage and old in years, and many Mlechcha tribes also wielding<br>weapons of various kinds, have been assembled together and are devoted to<br>the cause of the Pandavas. And there hath come Pandya also, who, hardly<br>inferior to Indra on the field of battle, is followed when he fights by<br>numberless warriors of great courage. Remarkably heroic and endued with<br>prowess and energy that have no parallel, he is devoted to the Pandava<br>cause. That same Satyaki who, I have heard, obtained weapons from Drona<br>and Arjuna and Krishna and Kripa and Bhishma, and who is said to be equal<br>to the son of Krishna, is devotedly attached to the Pandava cause. And<br>the assembled kings of the Chedi and the Karusha tribes have all taken<br>the part of the Pandavas with all their resources. That one in their<br>midst, who, having been endued with blazing beauty, shone like the sun,<br>whom all persons deemed unassailable in battle and the very best of all<br>drawers of the bow on earth, was slain by Krishna in a trice, by help of<br>his own great might, and counting for naught the bold spirit of all the<br>Kshatriya kings. Kesava cast his eyes on that Sishupala and smote him,<br>enhancing the fame and honour of the sons of Pandu. It was the same<br>Sishupala who was highly honoured by those kings at whose head stood the<br>king of the Karusha tribe. Then the other kings, deeming Krishna<br>unassailable when seated on his car drawn by Sugriva and other steeds,<br>left the chief of the Chedis and ran away like small animals at the sight<br>of a lion. And it was thus that he, who, from audacity had sought to<br>oppose and encounter Krishna in a combat hand to hand, was slain by<br>Krishna and lay down lifeless, resembling a Karnikara tree uprooted by a<br>gale. O Sanjaya, O son of Gavalgana, what they have told me of the<br>activity of Krishna in cause of Pandu's sons, and what I remember of his<br>past achievements, leave me no peace of mind. No foe whatsoever is<br>capable of withstanding them, who are under the lead of that lion of the<br>Vrishni tribe. My heart is trembling with fear upon learning that the two<br>Krishnas, are seated on the selfsame car. If my dull-headed son forbear<br>to fight with those two, then may he fare well,&#8212;else those two will<br>consume the race of Kuru as Indra and Upendra consume the Daitya hosts.<br>Dhananjaya is, I conceive, equal to Indra, and the greatest of the<br>Vrishni race, Krishna, is the Eternal Vishnu himself. The son of Kunti<br>and Pandu, Yudhishthira, is virtuous and brave and eschews deeds that<br>bring on shame. Endued with great energy, he hath been wronged by<br>Duryodhana. If he were not high-minded, the would in wrath burn the<br>Dhritarashtras. I do not so much dread Arjuna or Bhima or Krishna or the<br>twin brothers as I dread the wrath of the king, O Suta, when his wrath is<br>excited. His austerities are great; he is devoted to Brahmacharya<br>practices. His heart's wishes will certainly be fulfilled. When I think<br>of his wrath, O Sanjaya, and consider how just it is, I am filled with<br>alarm. Go thou speedily on a car, despatched by me, where the troops of<br>the king of the Panchalas are encamped. Thou wilt ask Yudhishthira about<br>his welfare. Thou wilt repeatedly address him in affectionate terms. Thou<br>wilt also meet Krishna, O child, who is the chief of all brave men and<br>who is endued with a magnanimous soul. Him also thou wilt ask on my part<br>as to his welfare, and tell him that Dhritarashtra is desirous of peace<br>with Pandu's sons. O Suta, there is nothing that Yudhishthira, the son of<br>Kunti, would not do at the bidding of Krishna. Kesava is as dear to them<br>as their own selves. Possessed of great learning, he is ever devoted to<br>their cause. Thou wilt also enquire about the welfare of all the<br>assembled sons of Pandu and the Srinjayas and Satyaki and Virata and all<br>the five sons of Draupadi, professing to be a messenger from me. And<br>whatsoever also thou mayst deem to be opportune, and beneficial for the<br>Bharata race, all that, O Sanjaya, thou must say in the midst of those<br>kings,&#8212;everything, in sooth, that may not be unpalatable or provocative<br>of war.'
