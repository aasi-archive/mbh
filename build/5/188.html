                            "Bhishma said, 'When I had formed this resolution, O king, a din of<br>tumultuous voices arose in the sky. And it said,&#8212;O son of Kuru's race,<br>do not let off the Praswapa weapon!&#8212;Notwithstanding this, I still aimed<br>that weapon at Bhrigu's descendant. When I had aimed it, Narada addressed<br>me, saying, 'Yonder, O Kauravya, stay the gods in the sky! Even they are<br>forbidding thee today! Do not aim the Praswapa weapon! Rama is an ascetic<br>possessed of Brahma merit, and he is, again, thy preceptor! Never,<br>Kauravya, humiliate him.' While Narada was telling me this, I beheld<br>those eight utterers of Brahma stationed in the sky. Smilingly, O king,<br>they said unto me slowly,&#8212;O chief of the Bharatas, do even what Narada<br>sayeth. Even that, O best of Bharata's race, is highly beneficial to the<br>world!' I then withdrew that great weapon called Praswapa and invoked<br>according to the ordinance the weapon called Brahma in the combat.<br>Beholding the Praswapa weapon withdrawn, O lion among kings, Rama was in<br>great huff, and suddenly exclaimed, 'Wretch that I am, I am vanquished, O<br>Bhishma!' Then Jamadagni's son behold before him his venerable father and<br>his father's fathers. They stood surrounding him there, and addressed him<br>in these words of consolation, 'O sire, never display such 'rashness<br>again, the rashness, viz., of engaging in battle with Bhishma, or<br>especially with any Kshatriya, O descendant of Bhrigu's race, to fight is<br>the duty of a Kshatriya! Study (of the Vedas) and practice of vows are<br>the highest wealth of Brahmanas! For some reason, before 'this, thou<br>hadst been ordered by us to take up weapons. Thou hadst then perpetrated<br>that terrible and unbecoming feat. Let this battle with Bhishma be thy<br>very last, for enough of it thou hadst already. O thou of mighty arms,<br>leave the combat. Blessed be thou, let this be the very last instance of<br>thy taking up the bow! O invincible one, throw thy bow aside, and<br>practice ascetic austerities, O thou of Bhrigu's race! Behold, Bhishma,<br>the son of Santanu, is forbidden by all the gods! They are endeavouring<br>to pacify him, repeatedly saying,&#8212;Desist from this battle! Do not light<br>with Rama who is thy preceptor. It is not proper for thee, O perpetuator<br>of Kuru's race, to vanquish Rama in battle! O son of Ganga, show this<br>Brahmana every honour on the field of battle! As regards thee, we are thy<br>superiors and therefore forbid thee! Bhishma is one of the foremost of<br>Vasus! O son, it is fortunate, that thou art still alive! Santanu's son<br>by Ganga&#8212;a celebrated Vasu as he is,&#8212;how can he be defeated by thee?<br>Desist, therefore, O Bhargava! That foremost of the Pandavas, Arjuna, the<br>mighty son of Indra, hath been ordained by the Self-create to be the<br>slayer of Bhishma!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by his own ancestors, Rama answered<br>them, saying, 'I cannot give up the combat. Even this is the solemn vow I<br>have made. Before this, I never left the field, giving up battle! Ye<br>grandsires, if you please, cause Ganga's son to desist from the fight! As<br>regards myself, I can, by no means, desist from the combat!' Hearing<br>these words of his, O king, those ascetics with Richika at their head,<br>coming to me with Narada in their company, told me, 'O sire, desist from<br>battle! Honour that foremost of Brahmanas!' For the sake of Kshatriya<br>morality, I replied unto them, saying. Even this is the vow I have taken<br>in this world, viz., that I would never desist from battle turning my<br>back, or suffer my back to be wounded with arrows! I cannot, from<br>temptation or distress, or fear, or for the sake of wealth, abandon my<br>eternal duty! Even this is my fixed resolution! Then all those ascetics<br>with Narada at their head, O king, and my mother Bhagirathi, occupied the<br>field of battle (before me). I, however, stayed quietly with arrows and<br>bow as before, resolved to fight. They then once more turned towards Rama<br>and addressed him, saying. 'The hearts of Brahmanas are made of butter.<br>Be pacified, therefore, O son of Bhrigu's race! O Rama, O Rama, desist<br>from this battle, O best of Brahmanas! Bhishma is incapable of being<br>slain by thee, as indeed, thou, O Bhargava, art incapable of being slain<br>by him!' Saying these words while they stood obstructing the field, the<br>Pitris caused that descendant of Bhrigu's race to place aside his<br>weapons. Just at this time I once more beheld those eight utterers of<br>Brahma, blazing with effulgence and resembling bright stars risen on the<br>firmament. Stationed for battle as I was, they said these words unto me<br>with great affection, 'O thou of mighty arms, go unto Rama who is thy<br>preceptor! Do what is beneficial to all the worlds. Beholding then that<br>Rama had desisted owing to the words of his well-wishers, I also, for the<br>good of the worlds, accepted the words of my well-wishers. Though mangled<br>exceedingly, I still approached Rama and worshipped him. The great<br>ascetic Rama then, smilingly, and with great affection, said unto me,<br>'There is no Kshatriya equal to thee on the earth! Go now, O Bhishma, for<br>in this combat thou hast pleased me highly'! Summoning then in my<br>presence that maiden (the daughter of Kasi), Bhargava sorrowfully said<br>unto her these words in the midst of all those high-souled persons.'"
