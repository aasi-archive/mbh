                            "Kanwa said, 'When Matali was wending his way, he saw the great Rishi<br>Narada proceeding at his pleasure to pay a visit to Varuna (the god of<br>the waters). And beholding Matali, Narada asked him, saying, 'Whither<br>dost thou go? Is it, O charioteer, on any mission of thy own, or is it at<br>Satakratu's command, that this journey of thine is undertaken?' Thus<br>addressed on the way by Narada who was proceeding towards his<br>destination, Matali duly informed Narada, of his mission. And the Rishi,<br>informed of everything, then said unto Matali, 'We shall go together. As<br>regards myself, it is to see the Lord of the waters that I am proceeding,<br>having left the heavens, searching the nether regions, I shall tell you<br>everything. After a good search there, we shall select a bridegroom, O<br>Matali! And penetrating then into nether regions, that illustrious<br>couple, Matali and Narada, beheld that Regent of the world&#8212;the Lord of<br>the waters. And there Narada received worship due to a celestial Rishi,<br>and Matali received that equal to what is offered to the great Indra. And<br>both of them skilful in business, informed Varuna of their purpose, and<br>obtaining his leave they began to wander in that region of the Nagas. And<br>Narada who knew all the residents of the nether regions then began to<br>describe in detail unto his companion all about the dwellers of the Naga<br>world.'<br><br>"And Narada said, 'Thou hast, O charioteer, seen Varuna surrounded by his<br>sons and grandsons. Behold the dominions of the Lord of the waters. It is<br>delightful all round, and full of riches. The son, endued with great<br>wisdom, of Varuna, the Lord of the Ocean, is even much distinguished for<br>his conduct and disposition and for his holiness. Possessed of eyes like<br>lotus leaves, this Pushkara is, indeed, Varuna's much-loved son, endued<br>with great beauty and delightful to behold. He has been chosen by Soma's<br>daughter as her husband. That daughter of Soma, equal in beauty unto a<br>second Sree, is known by the name of Jyotsnakali. Indeed, it is said,<br>that she had once before chosen the eldest and foremost of Aditi's son as<br>her lord. Behold now, O companion of the Lord of the celestials, that<br>abode, made entirely of gold, and full of the wine called Varuni. Indeed,<br>having obtained that wine, the gods acquired their god-heads. These<br>blazing weapons also of every kind that thou seest, belonged, O Matali,<br>to the Daityas who have been deprived of their sovereignty. These weapons<br>are incapable of deterioration, and when hurled at the foe always return<br>into the hand that hurleth them. Obtained by the gods as the booty of<br>war, they require considerable mental energy to be used against foes.<br>Here dwelt in days of yore many tribes of Rakshasas and Daityas,<br>possessed of many kinds of celestial weapons, but they were all<br>vanquished by the gods. Behold, there, in Varuna's lake is that fire of<br>blazing flames, and that discus of Vishnu surrounded by the lustrous<br>splendour of mighty caloric. Behold, there lieth that knotty bow that was<br>created for the destruction of the world. It is always protected with<br>great vigilance by the gods, and it is from this bow that the one wielded<br>by Arjuna hath taken its name. Endued with the strength of hundred<br>thousand bows, the power it assumes at the hour of battle is<br>indescribably great. It punishes all punishable wicked kings endued with<br>the nature of Rakshasas. This fierce weapon was first created by Brahman,<br>the utterer of the Vedas. The great preceptor Sukra hath said that this<br>weapon is a terrible one in respect of all kings. Endued with great<br>energy, it is held by the sons of the Lord of waters. Behold, there in<br>the umbrella-room is the umbrella of the Lord of the waters. It droppeth<br>refreshing showers like the clouds. The water dropped from this umbrella,<br>though pure as the moon, is yet enveloped by such darkness that it cannot<br>be seen by anybody. There, in these regions, O Matali, innumerable are<br>the wonders to be seen. Your business, however, will suffer if we spend<br>more time here. We will, therefore, leave this region soon.'"
