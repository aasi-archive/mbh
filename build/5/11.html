                            "Salya said, 'Then all the Rishis and the superior gods said, "Let the<br>handsome Nahusha be crowned as king of the gods. He is powerful and<br>renowned, and devoted to virtue ever more.' And they all went and said to<br>him, 'O lord of the earth, be thou our king.' And Nahusha intent on his<br>welfare, spoke to those gods and saints accompanied by the progenitors<br>(of mankind), 'I am feeble; I am not capable of protecting you; it is a<br>powerful person who should be your king; it is Indra who hath always been<br>possessed of strength.' And all the gods, led by the saints, spoke again<br>to him, 'Aided by the virtue of our austerities, rule thou the kingdom of<br>heaven. There is no doubt that we have all our respective fears. Be<br>crowned, O lord of monarchs, as the king of heaven. Whatever being may<br>stand within thy sight, whether he be a god, an Asura, a Yaksha, a saint,<br>a Pitri, or a Gandharva, thou shalt absorb his power and (thereby) wax<br>strong. Always placing virtue before (all other things), be thou the<br>ruler of the worlds. Protect also the Brahmarsis (Brahmana saints) and<br>the gods in heaven.' Then, O lord of monarchs, Nahusha was crowned king<br>in heaven. And placing virtue before (everything else), he became the<br>ruler of all the worlds. And though always of a virtuous disposition, yet<br>when he obtained that precious boon and the kingdom of heaven, Nahusha<br>assumed a sensual turn of mind. And when Nahusha became the king of the<br>gods, he surrounded himself with celestial nymphs, and with damsels of<br>celestial birth, and took to enjoyments of various kinds, in the Nandana<br>groves, on mount Kailasa, on the crest of Himavat, on Mandara. the White<br>hill Sahya, Mahendra and Malaya, as, also upon seas and rivers. And he<br>listened to various divine narratives that captivated both the ear and<br>the heart, and to the play of musical instruments of different sorts, and<br>to sweet vocal strains. And Viswavasu and Narada and bevies of celestial<br>nymphs and bands of Gandharvas and the six seasons in living shapes,<br>attended upon the king of the gods. And fragrant breezes, refreshingly<br>cool, blew round him. And while that wretch was thus enjoying himself, on<br>one occasion the goddess who was the favourite queen of Indra came in his<br>sight. And that vicious soul, having looked at her, said to the<br>courtiers, 'Why doth not this goddess, the queen of Indra, attend upon<br>me? I am the monarch of the gods, and also the ruler of the worlds. Let<br>Sachi make haste and visit me at my house.' Saddened at hearing this, the<br>goddess said to Vrihaspati, 'Protect me, O Brahmana, from this Nahusha. I<br>come to you as my refuge. You always say, O Brahmana, that I have got on<br>my person all the auspicious marks, being the favourite of the divine<br>king; that I am chaste, devoted to my lord, and destined never to become<br>a widow. All this about me you have said before. Let your words be made<br>true. O possessor of great powers, O lord, you never spoke words that<br>were vain. Therefore, O best of Brahmanas, this that you have said ought<br>to be true.' Then Vrihaspati said to the queen of Indra who was beside<br>herself through fear, 'What thou hast been told by me will come to be<br>true, be sure, O goddess. Thou shalt see Indra, the lord of the gods, who<br>will soon come back here. I tell thee truly, thou hast no fear from<br>Nahusha; I shall soon unite thee with Indra.' Now Nahusha came to hear<br>that Indra's queen had taken refuge with Vrihaspati, the son of Angiras.<br>And at this, the king became highly enraged.'
