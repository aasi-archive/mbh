                            "Salya said, 'Now then Nahusha, the king of the gods, looked at her and<br>said, 'O thou of sweet smiles, I am the Indra of all the three worlds. O<br>thou of beautiful thighs and fair complexion, accept me as thy lord!'<br>That chaste goddess, thus addressed by Nahusha, was terrified and quaked<br>like a plantain-stalk at a breezy spot. She bowed her head to Brahma, and<br>joining her hands spoke to Nahusha, the king of the gods, of awful mien,<br>said, 'O lord of the deities, I desire to obtain time. It is not known<br>what hath become of Indra, or where he is. Having enquired into the truth<br>regarding him, if, O lord, I obtain no news of him, then I shall visit<br>thee; this tell I thee for truth.' Thus addressed by Indra's queen,<br>Nahusha was pleased. And Nahusha said, 'Let it be so, O lady of lovely<br>hips, even as thou art telling me. Thou wilt come, after having<br>ascertained the news. I hope thou wilt remember thy plighted truth.'<br>Dismissed by Nahusha, she of auspicious looks stepped out; and that<br>famous lady went to the abode of Vrihaspati. And, O best of kings, the<br>gods with Agni at their head, when they heard her words, deliberated,<br>intent upon what would promote the interests of Indra. And they then<br>joined the powerful Vishnu, the God of gods. And skilled in making<br>speeches, the uneasy gods spoke the following words to him, 'Indra, the<br>lord of all the gods, hath been overpowered by the sin of Brahmanicide.<br>Thou, O lord of the gods, art the first-born, the ruler of the universe,<br>and our refuge. Thou hadst assumed the form of Vishnu for the protection<br>of all beings. When Vritra was killed through thy energy, Indra was<br>overwhelmed by the sin of Brahmanicide. O best of all the gods, prescribe<br>the means of setting him free.' Having heard these words of the gods,<br>Vishnu said, 'Let Indra. offer sacrifice to me. Even I shall purify the<br>holder of the thunderbolt. The chastiser of Paka, having performed the<br>holy horse-sacrifice, will fearlessly regain his dignity as lord of the<br>gods. And the wicked-minded Nahusha will be led to destruction by his<br>evil deeds. For a certain period, ye gods, ye must be patient, being<br>vigilant at the same time.' Having heard these words of Vishnu, words<br>that were true, and pleasant like ambrosia to their ears, the gods, with<br>their preceptor, and with the Rishis proceeded to that spot where Indra<br>was uneasy with fear. And there, O king, was performed a great<br>horse-sacrifice, capable of removing the sin of Brahmanicide, for the<br>purification of the high-minded and great Indra. And the lord of the<br>gods,&#8212;O Yudhishthira, divided the sin of Brahmanicide among trees and<br>rivers and mountains and the earth and women. And having distributed it<br>thus among those beings and parted with it, Indra was free from fever.<br>And rid of his sin, he came to himself. And at that place, the slayer of<br>the Asura Vala, quaked when he looked at Nahusha, before whom all<br>animated beings felt cowed, and who was unapproachable by virtue of the<br>boon the Rishis had granted to him. And the divine husband of Sachi<br>vanished from sight once again. And invisible to all beings, he wandered<br>biding his time. And Indra having disappeared, Sachi fell into grief. And<br>exceedingly miserable, she bewailed, 'Alas! O Indra, if ever I have made<br>a gift, or made offering to the gods, or have propitiated my spiritual<br>guides, if there is any truth in me, then I pray that my chastity may<br>remain inviolate. I bow myself to this goddess Night,&#8212;holy, pure,<br>running her course during this the northern journey of the sun,[1] let my<br>desire be fulfilled.' Saying this, she, in a purified condition of body<br>and soul, worshipped the goddess Night. And in the name of her chastity<br>and truth she had recourse to divination.[2] And she asked, 'Show me the<br>place where the king of the gods is. Let truth be verified by truth.' And<br>it was thus that she addressed the goddess of Divination.'
