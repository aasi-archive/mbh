                            "Bhishma said, 'Hearing, O bull of Bharata's race, those words of<br>Sikhandini, afflicted by destiny, that Yaksha, said after reflecting in<br>his mind, these words, 'Indeed, it was ordained to be so, and, O Kaurava,<br>it was ordained for my grief!' The Yaksha said, 'O Blessed lady, I will<br>certainly do what thou wishest! Listen, however, to the condition I make.<br>For a certain period I will give thee my manhood. Thou must, however,<br>come back to me in due time. Pledge thyself to do so! Possessed of<br>immense power, I am a ranger of the skies, wandering at my pleasure, and<br>capable of accomplishing whatever I intend. Through my grace, save the<br>city and thy kinsmen wholly! I will bear thy womanhood, O princess!<br>Pledge thy truth to me, I will do what is agreeable to thee!' Thus<br>addressed, Sikhandini said unto him, 'O holy one of excellent vows, I<br>will give thee back thy manhood! O wanderer of the night, bear thou my<br>womanhood for a short time! After the ruler of the Dasarnakas who is<br>cased in a golden mail will have departed (from my city) I will once more<br>become a maiden and thou wilt become a man!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Having said this (unto each other), they both. O<br>king, made a covenant, and imparted unto each other's body their sexes.<br>And the Yaksha Sthuna, O Bharata, became a female, while Sikhandini<br>obtained the blazing form of the Yaksha. Then, O king, Sikhandini of<br>Panchala's race, having obtained manhood, entered his city in great joy<br>and approached his father. And he represented unto Drupada everything<br>that had happened. And Drupada, bearing it all became highly glad. And<br>along with his wife the king recollected the words of Maheswara. And he<br>forthwith sent, O king, messenger unto the ruler of the Dasarnakas,<br>saying, 'This my child is a male. Let it be believed by thee!' The king<br>of the Dasarnakas meanwhile, filled with sorrow and grief, suddenly<br>approached Drupada, the ruler of the Panchalas. And arrived at Kampilya,<br>the Dasarnaka king despatched, after paying him proper honours, an envoy<br>who was one of the foremost of those conversant with the Vedas. And he<br>addressed the envoy, saying, 'Instructed by me, O messenger, say unto<br>that worst of kings the ruler of the Panchalas, these words,&#8212;viz., O<br>thou of wicked understanding, having selected my daughter as a wife for<br>one who is thy daughter, thou shalt today, without doubt, behold the<br>fruit of that act of deception.' Thus addressed and despatched by him, O<br>best of kings, the Brahmana set out for Drupada's city as Dasarnaka's<br>envoy. And having arrived at the city, the priest went unto Drupada's<br>presence. The king of the Panchalas then, with Sikhandin, offered the<br>envoy, O king, a cow and honey. The Brahmana, however, without accepting<br>that worship, said unto him these words that had been communicated<br>through him by the brave ruler of the Dasarnakas who was cased in a<br>golden mail. And he said, 'O thou of vile behaviours, I have been<br>deceived by thee through thy daughter (as the means)! I will exterminate<br>thee with thy counsellors and sons and kinsmen!' Having, in the midst of<br>his counsellors, been made by that priest to hear those words fraught<br>with censure and uttered by the ruler of the Dasarnakas, king Drupada<br>then, O chief of Bharata's race, assuming a mild behaviour from motives<br>of friendship, 'said, The reply to these words of my brother that thou<br>hast said unto me, O Brahmana, will be carried to that monarch by my<br>envoy!' And king Drupada then, sent unto the high-souled Hiranyavarman a<br>Brahmana learned in the Vedas as his envoy. And that envoy, going unto<br>king Hiranyavarman, the ruler of the Dasarnakas, said unto him, 'O<br>monarch, the word that Drupada had entrusted him with.' And he said,<br>'This my child is really a male. Let it be made clear by means of<br>witness! Somebody has spoken falsely to thee. That should not be<br>believed!' Then the king of the Dasarnakas, having heard the words of<br>Drupada, was filled with sorrow and despatched a number of young ladies<br>of great beauty for ascertaining whether Sikhandin was a male or female.<br>Despatched by him, those ladies, having ascertained (the truth) joyfully<br>told the king of the Dasarnakas everything, viz., that Sikhandin, O chief<br>of the Kurus, was a powerful person of the masculine sex. Hearing that<br>testimony, the ruler of the Dasarnakas was filled with great joy, and<br>wending then unto his brother Drupada, passed a few days with him in joy.<br>And the king, rejoiced as he was, gave unto Sikhandin much wealth, many<br>elephants and steeds and kine. And worshipped by Drupada (as long as he<br>stayed), the Dasarnaka king then departed, having rebuked his daughter.<br>And after king Hiranyavarman, the ruler of the Dasarnakas had departed in<br>joy and with his anger quelled, Sikhandin began to rejoice exceedingly.<br>Meanwhile, sometime after (the exchange of sexes had taken place) Kuvera,<br>who was always borne on the shoulders of human beings, in course of a<br>journey (through the earth), came to the abode of Sthuna. Staying (in the<br>welkin) above that mansion, the protector of all the treasures saw that<br>the excellent abode of the Yaksha Sthuna was well-adorned with beautiful<br>garland of flowers, and perfumed with fragrant roots of grass and many<br>sweet scents. And it was decked with canopies, and scented incense. And<br>it was also beautiful with standards and banners. And it was filled with<br>edibles and drink of every kind. And beholding that beautiful abode of<br>the Yaksha decked all over, and filled also with garlands of jewels and<br>gems and perfumed with the fragrance of diverse kinds of flowers, and<br>well-watered, and well-swept, the lord of the Yakshas addressed the<br>Yakshas that followed him, saying, 'Ye that are endued with immeasurable<br>prowess, this mansion of Sthuna is well-adorned! Why, however, doth not<br>that wight of wicked understanding come to me? And since that<br>wicked-souled one, knowing I am here, approacheth me not, therefore, some<br>severe punishment should be inflicted on him! Even this is my intention!'<br>Hearing these words of his, the Yakshas said, 'O king, the royal Drupada<br>had a daughter born unto him, of the name of Sikhandini! Unto her, for<br>some reason, Sthuna had given his own manhood, and having taken her<br>womanhood upon him, he stayeth within his abode having become a woman!<br>Bearing as he doth a feminine form, he doth not, therefore, approach thee<br>in shame! It is for this reason, O king, that Sthuna cometh not to thee!<br>Hearing all this, do what may be proper!' Let the car be stopped here!<br>Let Sthuna be brought to me,&#8212;were the words that the lord of the Yakshas<br>uttered, and repeatedly said,&#8212;I will punish him!&#8212;Summoned then by the<br>Lord of Yakshas, Sthuna bearing a feminine form came thither, O king, and<br>stood before him in shame. Then, O thou of Kuru's race, the giver of<br>wealth cursed him in anger, saying, 'Ye Guhyakas, let the femininity of<br>the wretch remain as it is!' And the high-souled lord of the Yakshas also<br>said, 'Since humiliating all the Yakshas, thou hast, O thou of sinful<br>deeds, given away thy own sex to Sikhandini and taken from her, O thou of<br>wicked understanding, her femininity,&#8212;since, O wicked wretch, thou hast<br>done what hath never been done by anybody,&#8212;therefore from this day, thou<br>shalt remain a woman and she shall remain a man!' At these words of his,<br>all the Yakshas began to soften Vaisravana for the sake of Sthunakarna<br>repeatedly saying, 'Set a limit to thy curse!' The high-souled lord of<br>the Yakshas then said unto all these Yakshas that followed him, from<br>desire of setting a limit to his curse, these words, viz.,&#8212;After<br>Sikhandin's death, ye Yakshas, this one will regain his own form!<br>Therefore, let this high-souled Yaksha Sthuna be freed from his anxiety!<br>Having said this, the illustrious and divine king of the Yakshas,<br>receiving due worship, departed with all his followers who were capable<br>of traversing a great distance within the shortest space of time. And<br>Sthuna, with that curse pronounced on him, continued to live there. And<br>when the time came, Sikhandin without losing a moment came unto that<br>wanderer of the night. And approaching his presence he said, It have come<br>to thee, O holy one!' Sthuna then repeatedly said unto him, 'I am pleased<br>with thee!' Indeed, beholding that prince return to him without guile,<br>Sthuna told Sikhandin everything that had happened. Indeed, the Yaksha<br>said, 'O son of a king, for thee I have been cursed by Vaisravana. Go<br>now, and live happily amongst men as thou choosest. Thy coming here and<br>the arrival of Pulastya's son were, I think, both ordained from<br>beforehand. All this was incapable of being prevented!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by the Kaksha, Sthuna, Sikhandin, O<br>Bharata, came to his city, filled with great joy. And he worshipped with<br>diverse scents and garlands of flower and costly presents persons of the<br>regenerate class, deities, big trees and crossways. And Drupada, the<br>ruler of the Panchalas, along with his son Sikhandin whose wishes had<br>been crowned with success, and with also his kinsmen, became exceedingly<br>glad. And the king then, O bull of Kuru's race, gave his son, Sikhandin,<br>who had been a woman, as a pupil, O monarch, to Drona. An prince<br>Sikhandin obtained, along with yourselves, the whole science of arms with<br>its four divisions. And (his brother) Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race<br>also obtained the same. Indeed, all this way represented unto me, O sire,<br>by the spies, disguised as idiots and as persons without the senses of<br>vision, and hearing whom I had set upon Drupada. It is thus, O king, that<br>that best of Rathas. Sikhandin, the son of Drupada, having first been<br>born a female, subsequently became a person of the other sex. And it was<br>the eldest daughter of the ruler of Kasi, celebrated by the name of Amva,<br>who was, O bull of Bharata's race, born in Drupada's line as Sikhandin.<br>If he approacheth me bow in hand and desirous of fight, I will not look<br>at him even for a moment nor smite him, O thou of unfading glory!<br>Even&#8212;this is my vow, known over all the world, viz., that I will not, O<br>son of Kuru's race, shoot weapons upon a woman, or one that was a woman<br>before or one bearing a feminine name, or one whose form resembleth a<br>woman's. I will not, for this reason, slay Sikhandin. Even this, O sire,<br>is the story that I have ascertained of Sikhandin's birth. I will not,<br>therefore, slay him in battle even if he approacheth me weapon in hand.<br>If Bhishma slayeth a woman the righteous will all speak ill of him. I<br>will not, therefore, slay him even if I behold him waiting for battle!'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing these words of Bhishma, king Duryodhana of<br>Kuru's race, reflecting for a moment, thought even that behaviour was<br>proper for Bhishma.'"
