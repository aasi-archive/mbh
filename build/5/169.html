                            "Bhishma said, 'Both the brothers Achala and Vrisha are Rathas.<br>Invincible (in battle) they will slay thy foes. Endued with great<br>strength, those tigers among men, those foremost of Gandharvas, are firm<br>in wrath. Young and handsome, they are possessed of great strength. As<br>regards this thy ever dear friend, this one who is always boastful of his<br>skill in battle, this one who always urgeth thee, O king, to fight with<br>the Pandavas, this vile braggart, Karna, the son of Surya, this one who<br>is thy counsellor, guide, and friend, this vain wight who is destitute of<br>sense, this Karna, is neither a Ratha nor an Atiratha. Without sense,<br>this one hath been deprived of his natural coat of mail. Always kind, he<br>hath also been deprived of his celestial ear-rings. In consequence of the<br>curse of Rama (his preceptor in arms) as also of the words of a Brahmana<br>(who cursed him on another occasion), owing also to his deprivation of<br>the accoutrements of battle, he, in my judgment, is only half a Ratha.<br>Having approached Falguni (in battle), he will not certainly escape with<br>life!' Hearing this, Drona, that foremost of all wielders of weapons,<br>said, 'It is even so as thou hast said. That is not untrue! He boasteth<br>on the eve of every battle, but yet he is seen to retreat from every<br>engagement. Kind (out of season) and blundering, it is for this that<br>Karna, in my judgment, is only half a Ratha!'<br><br>"Hearing these words, Radha's son, expanding his eyes in rage, and<br>afflicting Bhishma with words like sharp hooks, said unto Ganga's son<br>these words, 'O grandsire, though I am innocent yet from thy aversion to<br>me, thou manglest me thus, according to thy pleasure, with thy wordy<br>arrows at every step. I tolerate, however, all this for the sake of<br>Duryodhana. Indicating me as only half a Ratha, thou regardest me<br>worthless, as if, indeed, I were a coward! What doubt is there in this? I<br>do not speak an untruth when I say that thou, O Ganga's son, art an enemy<br>of the whole universe, and especially of all the Kurus! The king,<br>however, doth not know this! Who else is there that would thus seek to<br>disunite and abate the energy of these kings that are all equal and that<br>are all equally brave, as thou, from thy hatred of merit, seekest to do?<br>O Kaurava, neither years, nor wrinkles, nor wealth, nor possession of<br>friends, would entitle a Kshatriya to be regarded as a Maharatha! It hath<br>been said that a Kshatriya acquireth eminence only through might, as<br>Brahmanas acquire eminence through superiority in mantras, as Vaisyas<br>through wealth, and Sudras through age. Influenced, however, by lust and<br>envy, and acting from ignorance, thou hast indicated Rathas and Atirathas<br>according only to thy own caprice! Blessed be thou, O mighty-armed<br>Duryodhana, judge properly! Let this wicked Bhishma, who only wrongeth<br>thee, be abandoned by thee! Thy warriors, once disunited, can with<br>difficulty be united again. O tiger among men, thy main army, under such<br>circumstances, can with difficulty be united; far greater will the<br>difficulty be in uniting an army gathered from various provinces! Behold,<br>O Bharata, doubt (of success) hath already arisen in the hearts of thy<br>warriors! This Bhishma weakeneth our energy in our very presence! Where<br>is the task of ascertaining the merits of Rathas, and where is Bhishma of<br>little understanding? I alone will withstand the army of Pandavas. Coming<br>in contact with me, whose arrows never go for nothing, the Pandavas and<br>the Panchalas will fly away in all directions like oxen when they come in<br>contact with a tiger! Where, Oh, are battle, the press of armed<br>encounter, good counsels and well-expressed words, and where is Bhishma,<br>who is superannuated and of wicked soul, and who is impelled by the very<br>fates to become their victim? Alone he challengeth the whole universe! Of<br>false vision he regardeth none else as a man. It is true the scriptures<br>teach that the words of the old should be listened to. That, however,<br>doth not refer to those that are very old, for these, in my judgment,<br>become children again. Alone I will exterminate the army of the Pandavas!<br>The fame, however, of such a feat will attach to Bhishma, O tiger among<br>kings, for this Bhishma, O monarch, hath been made by thee the commander<br>of thy forces, and the renown always attacheth to the leader and not to<br>those that fight under him. I will not, therefore, O king, fight as long<br>as Ganga's son liveth! After Bhishma, however, hath been laid low, I will<br>fight with all the Maharathas of the enemy united together!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'This burden, vast as the ocean, in the matter of<br>Duryodhana's battle (with the Pandavas), is about to be taken up by me. I<br>have thought of it for many years. Now that the hour is come for that<br>terrible encounter, dissensions amongst ourselves should not be created<br>by me. It is for this, Suta's son, that thou livest! Else, superannuated<br>though I am and young in years thou art, I would quell thy desire for<br>battle and crush thy hope of life! (Thy preceptor) Rama, the son of<br>Jamadagni, shooting his great weapons, could not cause me the slightest<br>pain. What canst thou, therefore, do to me? They that are good, do not<br>approve self-praise. Infamous wretch of thy race, know that I indulge in<br>little boast because I am enraged. Vanquishing on a single car all the<br>assembled Kshatriyas of the world at the Swayamvara of the daughters of<br>the ruler of Kasi, I abducted those maidens. Alone, I stopped on the<br>field of battle the rush of countless kings with their soldiers!<br>Obtaining thee as embodiment of strife, a great calamity is ready to<br>overtake the Kurus! Strive then for slaying our antagonists. Be a man,<br>fight with that Partha, whom thou so often challengest. O thou of wicked<br>understanding, I desire to see thee come out of that encounter with thy<br>life!'<br><br>"King Duryodhana then said unto Bhishma, of great prowess, 'Cast thy eyes<br>on me, O Ganga's son! Great is the business that is at hand! Think<br>earnestly as how I may be most benefited! Both of you will render me<br>great services! I desire now to bear of the best car-warriors among the<br>enemy, that is, of those that are Atirathas among them and of those that<br>are leaders of car-division. O Kaurava, I desire to hear of the strength<br>and weakness of my foes, since when this night will dawn, our great<br>battle will take place.'"
