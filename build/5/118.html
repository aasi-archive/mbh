                            "Narada said, 'The illustrious Madhavi, faithful to her promise,<br>abandoning that prosperity and once more becoming a maiden, followed the<br>footsteps of the Brahmana Galava. And Galava, whose heart was set upon<br>the accomplishment of his own business, reflecting upon what he should do<br>next then went to the city of the Bhojas for waiting upon king Usinara.<br>And arrived before that king of unbaffled prowess, Galava addressed him,<br>saying, 'This maiden will bear thee two royal sons. And, O king,<br>begetting upon her two sons equal unto the Sun and the Moon, thou mayst<br>attain all thy objects both here and hereafter. As her dower, however, O<br>thou that art conversant with every duty, thou shalt have to give me four<br>hundred steeds of lunar splendour, each having ear black of hue. This<br>effort of mine for obtaining the steeds is only on account of my<br>preceptor, otherwise I myself have nothing to do with them. If thou art<br>able to accept (my terms), do as I bid thee without any hesitation. O<br>royal sage, thou art now childless. Beget, O king, a couple of children.<br>With offspring so begot as a raft, save they Pitris and thyself also. O<br>royal sage, he that hath fruit in the shape of offspring to enjoy, never<br>falleth from heaven. Nor hath such a person to go to that frightful hell<br>whither the childless are doomed to go.' Hearing these and other words of<br>Galava, king Usinara. replied unto him, saying, 'I have heard what thou,<br>O Galava, hast said. My heart also is inclined to do thy bidding. The<br>Supreme Ordainer, however, is all-powerful. I have only two hundred<br>steeds of the kind indicated by thee, O best of Brahmanas. Of other<br>kinds, I have many thousands moving about in my dominions. I will, O<br>Galava, beget only one son upon her, by treading the path that hath been<br>told by others such as Haryyaswa and Divodasa. I will act after their<br>manner in the matter of the dower. O best of Brahmanas, my wealth exists<br>for only my subjects residing in the city and the country, and not for my<br>own comforts and enjoyment. That king, O virtuous one, who giveth away<br>for his own pleasure the wealth that belongeth to others, can never earn<br>virtue or fame. Let this maiden, endued with the radiance of a celestial<br>girl, be presented to me. I will accept her for begetting only one<br>child.' Hearing these and many other words that Usinara spoke, that best<br>of Brahmanas, Galava, then applauded the monarch and gave him the maiden.<br>And making Usinara accept that damsel, Galava went into the woods. And<br>like a righteous man enjoying the prosperity (won by his deeds), Usinara<br>began to sport with and enjoy that damsel in valleys and dales of<br>mountains by fountains and falls of rivers, in mansions, delightful<br>chambers, variegated gardens, forests and woods, agreeable places, and<br>terraces of houses. And, in due time, was born unto him a son of the<br>splendour of the morning sun, who afterwards became an excellent king,<br>celebrated by the name Sivi. And after the birth of that son, the<br>Brahmana Galava came to Usinara, and taking back from him the maiden<br>went, O king, to see the son of Vinata.'"
