                            "Vaisampayana said, 'In the midst, O Bharata, of all those assembled<br>kings, Bhishma, the son of Santanu, then said these words unto<br>Duryodhana, 'Once on a time, Vrihaspati and Sakra went to Brahma. The<br>Maruts also with Indra, the Vasus with Agni, the Adityas, the Sadhyas,<br>the seven celestial Rishis, the Gandharvas, Viswavasu, and the beautiful<br>tribes of the Apsaras, all approached the ancient Grandsire. And having<br>bowed down unto the Lord of the universe, all those dwellers of heaven<br>sat around him. Just then, the two ancient deities, the Rishis Nara and<br>Narayana, as if drawing unto themselves by their own energy the minds and<br>energies of all who were present there, left the place.' Thereupon,<br>Vrihaspati asked Brahma, saying,&#8212;Who are these two that leave the place<br>without worshipping thee? Tell us, O Grandsire, who are they? Thus asked,<br>Brahma said, 'These two, endued with ascetic merit, blazing with<br>effulgence and beauty, illuminating both the earth and the heaven,<br>possessed of great might, and pervading and surpassing all, are Nara and<br>Narayana, dwelling now in the region of Brahman having arrived from the<br>other world. Endued with great might and prowess, they shine in<br>consequence of their own asceticism. By their acts they always contribute<br>to the joy of the world. Worshipped by the gods and the Gandharvas, they<br>exist only for the destruction of Asuras.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Having heard these words, Sakra went to the spot<br>where those two were practising ascetic austerities, accompanied by all<br>the celestials and having Vrihaspati at their head. At that time, the<br>dwellers of heaven had been very much alarmed in consequence of a war<br>raging between themselves and the Asuras. And Indra asked that<br>illustrious couple to grant him a boon. Thus solicited, O best of the<br>Bharata race, those two said,&#8212;Name thou the boon.&#8212;Upon this Sakra said<br>unto them,&#8212;Give us your aid.&#8212;They then said unto Sakra,&#8212;We will do<br>what thou wishest. And then it was with their aid that Sakra subsequently<br>vanquished the Daityas and the Danavas. The chastiser of foes, Nara, slew<br>in battle hundreds and thousands of Indra's foes among the Paulomas and<br>the Kalakhanjas. It was this Arjuna, who, riding on a whirling car,<br>severed in battle, with a broad-headed arrow, the head of the Asura<br>Jambha while the latter was about to swallow him. It was he who afflicted<br>(the Daitya city of Hiranyapura) on the other side of the ocean, having<br>vanquished in battle sixty thousands of Nivatakavachas. It was this<br>conqueror of hostile towns, this Arjuna of mighty arms, that gratified<br>Agni, having vanquished the very gods with Indra at their head. And<br>Narayana also hath, in this world, destroyed in the same way numberless<br>other Daityas and Danavas. Even such are those two of mighty energy that<br>are now seen united with each other. It hath been heard by us that the<br>two heroic and mighty car-warriors, Vasudeva and Arjuna, that are now<br>united with each other, are those same ancient gods, the divine Nara and<br>Narayana. Amongst all on earth they are incapable of being vanquished by<br>the Asuras and the gods headed by Indra himself. That Narayana is<br>Krishna, and that Nara is Falguna. Indeed, they are one Soul born in<br>twain. These two, by their acts, enjoy numerous eternal and inexhaustible<br>regions, and are repeatedly born in those worlds when destructive wars<br>are necessary. For this reason their mission is to fight. Just this is<br>what Narada, conversant with the Vedas, had said unto the Vrishnis. When<br>thou, O Duryodhana, wilt see Kesava with conch-shell and discus, and mace<br>in hand, and that terrible wielder of the bow, Arjuna, armed with<br>weapons, when thou wilt behold those eternal and illustrious ones, the<br>two Krishnas seated on the same car, then wilt thou, O child, remember<br>these my words. Why should not such danger threaten the Kurus when thy<br>intellect, O child, hath fallen off from both profit and virtue? If thou<br>heedest not my words, thou shalt then have to hear of the slaughter of<br>many, for all the Kauravas accept thy opinion. Thou art alone in holding<br>as true the opinion, O bull of the Bharata race, only three persons,<br>viz., Karna, a low-born Suta's son cursed by Rama, Sakuni, the son of<br>Suvala, and thy mean and sinful brother Dussasana.'<br><br>'Karna said. 'It behoveth thee not, O blessed grandsire, to use such<br>words towards me, for I have adopted the duties of the Kshatriya order<br>without falling off from those of my own. Besides, what wickedness is<br>there in me? I have no sin known to any one of Dhritarashtra's people. I<br>have never done any injury to Dhritarashtra's son; on the other hand, I<br>will slay all the Pandavas in battle. How can they that are wise make<br>peace again with those that have before been injured? It is always my<br>duty to do all that is agreeable to king Dhritarashtra, and especially to<br>Duryodhana, for he is in possession of the kingdom.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having listened to these words of Karna,<br>Bhishma the son of Santanu, addressing king Dhritarashtra, again said,<br>'Although this one often boasteth saying,&#8212;I shall slay the<br>Pandavas,&#8212;yet he is not equal to even a sixteenth part of high-souled<br>Pandavas. Know that the great calamity that is about to overtake thy sons<br>of wicked souls, is the act of this wretched son of a Suta! Relying upon<br>him, thy foolish son Suyodhana hath insulted those heroes of celestial<br>descent, those chastiser of all foes. What, however, is that difficult<br>feat achieved by this wretch before that is equal to any of those<br>achieved of old by every one of the Pandavas? Beholding in the city of<br>Virata his beloved brother slain by Dhananjaya who displayed such<br>prowess, what did this one then do? When Dhananjaya, rushing against all<br>the assembled Kurus, crushed them and took away their robes, was this one<br>not there then? When thy son was being led away as a captive by the<br>Gandharvas on the occasion of the tale of the cattle, where was this son<br>of a Suta then who now belloweth like a bull? Even there, it was Bhima,<br>and the illustrious Partha, and the twins, that encountered the<br>Gandharvas and vanquished them. Ever beautiful, and always unmindful of<br>both virtue and profit, these, O bull of the Bharata race, are the many<br>false things, blessed be thou, that this one uttereth.'<br><br>'Having heard these words of Bhishma, the high-souled son of Bharadwaja,<br>having paid due homage unto Dhritarashtra and the assembled kings, spoke<br>unto him these words, 'Do that, O king, which the best of the Bharatas,<br>Bhishma, hath said. It behoveth thee not to act according to the words of<br>those that are covetous of wealth. Peace with the Pandavas, before the<br>war breaks out, seems to be the best. Everything said by Arjuna and<br>repeated here by Sanjaya, will, I know, be accomplished by that son of<br>Pandu, for there is no bowman equal unto him in the three world!' Without<br>regarding, however, these words spoken by both Drona and Bhishma, the<br>king again asked Sanjaya about the Pandavas. From that moment, when the<br>king returned not a proper answer to Bhishma and Drona, the Kauravas gave<br>up all hopes of life.'"
