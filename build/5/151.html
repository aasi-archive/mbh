                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing these words of Janardana, king Yudhishthira<br>the Just, of virtuous soul, addressed his brothers in the presence of<br>Kesava and said, 'Ye have heard all that had happened in the court of the<br>assembled Kurus. Ye have also understood the words uttered by Kesava. Ye,<br>best of men, draw up, therefore, my troops now in battle-array in which<br>they are to fight. Here are seven Akshauhinis of troops assembled for our<br>victory. Hear the names of those seven celebrated warriors that would<br>lead those seven Akshauhinis. They are Drupada, and Virata, and<br>Dhristadyumna, and Sikhandin, and Satyaki, Chekitana, and Bhimasena of<br>great energy. Those heroes will be the leaders of my troops. All of them<br>are conversant with the Vedas. Endued with great bravery, all of them<br>have practised excellent vows. Possessed of modesty, all of them are<br>conversant with policy, and accomplished in war. Well-skilled in arrows<br>and weapons, all of them are competent in the use of every kind of<br>weapon. Tell us now, O Sahadeva, O son of Kuru's race, who that warrior,<br>is conversant with all kinds of battle-array, that may become the leader<br>of these seven and may also withstand in battle Bhishma who is like unto<br>a fire having arrows for its flames. Give us thy own opinion, O tiger<br>among men, as who is fit to be our generalissimo.'<br><br>"Sahadeva said, 'Closely related to us, sympathising with us in our<br>distress, endued with great might, conversant with every virtue, skilled<br>in weapons, and irresistible in battle, the mighty king of the Matsyas,<br>Virata, relying upon whom we hope to recover our share of the kingdom,<br>will be able to bear in battle both Bhishma and all those mighty<br>car-warriors.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'After Sahadeva had said this, eloquent Nakula<br>then said these words, 'He that in years, in knowledge of scriptures, in<br>perseverance, in family and birth, is respectable; he that is endued with<br>modesty, strength, and prosperity; he that is well-versed in all branches<br>of learning; he that studied the science of weapons (with the sage<br>Bharadwaja); he, who is irresistible and firmly devoted to truth; he that<br>always challenges Drona and mighty Bhishma; he that belongs to one of the<br>foremost of royal houses; he that is a famous leader of hosts; he that<br>resembles a tree of hundred branches in consequence of sons and grandsons<br>that surround him; that king, who, with his wife, performed, moved by<br>wrath, the austerest of penances for the destruction of Drona; that hero,<br>who is an ornament of assemblies; that bull among monarchs who always<br>cherishes us like a father; that father-in-law of ours, Drupada, should<br>be our generalissimo. It is my opinion that he will be able to withstand<br>both Drona and Bhishma rushing to battle, for that king is the friend of<br>Angira's descendant Drona and is conversant with celestial weapons.'<br><br>'After the two sons of Madri had thus expressed their individual<br>opinions, Vasava's son, Savyasachin, who was equal to Vasava himself,<br>said these words, 'This celestial person of the hue of fire and endued<br>with mighty arms, who sprang into life through the power of ascetic<br>penances and the gratification of sages; who issued from the sacrificial<br>fire-hole armed with bow and sword, accoutred in armour of steel, mounted<br>on a car unto which were yoked excellent steeds of the best breed, and<br>the clatter of whose car-wheels was as deep as the roar of mighty masses<br>of clouds; this hero endued with that energy and strength and resembling<br>the very lion in his frame of body and prowess, and possessed of leonine<br>shoulders, arms, chest, and voice like the lion's roar; this hero of<br>great effulgence; this warrior of handsome brows, fine teeth, round<br>cheeks, long arms, of stout make, excellent thighs, large expansive eyes,<br>excellent legs, and strong frame; this prince who is incapable of being<br>penetrated by weapons of any kind, and who looks like an elephant with<br>rent temples; this Dhrishtadyumna, truthful in speech, and with passions<br>under control, was born for the destruction of Drona. It is this<br>Dhrishtadyumna, I think, that will be able to bear Bhishma's arrows which<br>strike with the vehemence of the thunderbolt and look like snakes with<br>blazing mouths, which resemble the messengers of Yama in speed, and fall<br>like flames of fire (consuming everything they touch), and which were<br>borne before by Rama alone in battle. I do not, O king, see the man<br>except Dhrishtadyumna, who is able to withstand Bhishma of great vows.<br>This is just what I think. Endued with great lightness of hand and<br>conversant with all the modes of warfare, accoutred in coat of mail that<br>is incapable of being penetrated by weapons, this handsome hero,<br>resembling the leader of a herd of elephants, is according to my opinion,<br>fit to be our generalissimo.'<br><br>"Bhima then said, 'That son of Drupada, Sikhandin, who is born for the<br>destruction of Bhishma, as is said, 'O king, by the sages and Siddhas<br>assembled together, whose form on the field of battle, while displaying<br>celestial weapons, will be seen by men to resemble that of the<br>illustrious Rama himself, I see not, O king, the person who is able to<br>pierce with weapons that Sikhandin, when he is stationed for battle on<br>his car, accoutred in mail. Except the heroic Sikhandin, there is no<br>other warrior who is able to slay Bhishma in single combat. It is for<br>this, O king, that I think Sikhandin is fit to be our generalissimo.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O sire, the strength and weakness, might and<br>feebleness, of everything in the universe, and the intentions of every<br>person here, are well-known to virtuous Kesava. Skilled or unskilled in<br>weapons, old or young, let him be the leader of my forces, who may be<br>indicated by Krishna of Dasarha's race. Even he is the root of our<br>success or defeat. In him are our lives, our kingdom, our prosperity and<br>adversity, our happiness and misery. Even he is the Ordainer and Creator.<br>In him is established the fruition of our desires. Let him, therefore, be<br>the leader of our host, who may be named by Krishna. Let that foremost of<br>speakers say, for the night approacheth. Having selected our leader,<br>worshipped our weapons with offerings of flowers and perfumes, we will,<br>at day-break, under Krishna's orders march to the field of battle!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of the intelligent king,<br>Yudhishthira the Just, the lotus-eyed Krishna said, eyeing Dhananjaya,<br>the white, O king, I fully approve of all those powerful warriors whom ye<br>have named for becoming the leaders of thy troops. All of them are<br>competent to withstand thy foes. Indeed, they can frighten Indra himself<br>in great battle, let alone the covetous and wicked-minded sons of<br>Dhritarashtra. O thou of mighty arms, for thy good I made great efforts<br>to prevent the battle by bringing about peace. By that we have been freed<br>from the debt we owed to virtue. Fault-finding persons will not be able<br>to reproach us for anything. Foolish Duryodhana, destitute of<br>understanding, regardeth himself as skilled in weapons, and though really<br>weak thinketh himself to be possessed of strength. Array thy troops soon,<br>for slaughter is the only means by which they can be made to yield to our<br>demands. Indeed, the sons of Dhritarashtra will never be able to keep<br>their ground when they will behold Dhananjaya with Yuyudhana as his<br>second, and Abhimanyu, and the five sons of Draupadi, and Virata, and<br>Drupada, and the other kings of fierce prowess,&#8212;all lords of<br>Akshauhinis. Our army is possessed of great strength, and is invincible<br>and incapable of being withstood. Without doubt, it will slay the<br>Dhartarashtra host. As regards our leader, I would name that chastiser of<br>foes, Dhrishtadyumna.'"
