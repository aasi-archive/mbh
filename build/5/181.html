                            "Bhishma said, 'After he had quartered there, on third day, O king,<br>Jamadagni's son of high vows, sent a message to me, saying, 'I have come<br>here, do what is agreeable to me.' Hearing that Rama, of great might, had<br>come to the confines of our kingdom, I speedily went with a joyous heart<br>to that master who was an ocean of energy. And I went to him, O king,<br>with a cow placed in the van of my train, and accompanied by many<br>Brahmanas, and (ordinary) priests (of our family), and by others,<br>resembling the very gods in splendour, employed by us on special<br>occasions. And beholding me arrived at his presence, Jamadagni's son, of<br>great prowess, accepted the worship I offered unto him and said these<br>words unto me.'<br><br>"Rama said, 'Thyself, divested of desire, with what mood of mind, O<br>'Bhishma, didst thou abduct, on the occasion of her self-choice, his<br>daughter of the king of Kasi and again dismiss her subsequently? By thee<br>hath this famous lady been dissociated from virtue! Contaminated by the<br>touch of thy hands before, who can marry her now? Rejected she hath been<br>by Salwa, because thou, O Bharata, hadst abducted her. Take her<br>therefore, to thyself, O Bharata, at my command. Let this daughter of a<br>king, O tiger among men, be charged with the duties of her sex! O king, O<br>sinless one, it is not proper that this humiliation should be hers!<br><br>'Seeing him plunged into sorrow (on account of the maiden) I said unto<br>him,&#8212;O Brahmana, I cannot, by any means, bestow this girl on my brother.<br>O thou of Bhrigu's race, it was to myself that she said, I am Salwa's!<br>And it was by me that she was permitted to go to Salwa's city. As regards<br>myself, even this is my firm vow that I cannot abandon Kshatriya<br>practices from fear or pity, or avarice of wealth, or lust!&#8212;Hearing<br>these words of mine, Rama addressed me, with eyes rolling in anger,<br>saying, 'If, O bull among, men, thou dost not act according to my words,<br>I will slay thee this very day along with all thy counsellors!' Indeed,<br>with eyes rolling in anger, Rama in great wrath told me these words<br>repeatedly. I, however, O chastiser of foes, then beseeched him in sweet<br>words. But though beseeched by me, he did not cool down. Bowing down with<br>my head unto that best of Brahmanas I then enquired of him the reason for<br>which he sought battle with me. I also said,&#8212;O thou of mighty arms,<br>while I was a child it was thou who instructed me in the four kinds of<br>arms.[18] I am, therefore, O thou of Bhrigu's race, thy disciple! Then<br>Rama answered me with eyes red in anger, 'Thou knowest me, O Bhishma, to<br>be thy preceptor, and yet, O Kauravya, thou acceptest not, for pleasing<br>me, this daughter of the ruler of Kasi! O delighter of the Kurus, I<br>cannot be gratified unless thou actest in this way! O mighty-armed one,<br>take this maiden and preserve thy race! Having been abducted by thee, she<br>obtaineth not a husband. Unto Rama that subjugator of hostile cities, I<br>replied, saying.&#8212;This cannot be, O regenerate Rishi! All thy labour is<br>vain, O son of Jamadagni, remembering thy old preceptorship, I am<br>striving, O holy one, to gratify thee! As regards this maiden, she hath<br>been refused by me before knowing what the faults, productive of great<br>evils, of the female sex are, who is there that would admit into his<br>abode a woman whose heart is another's and who (on that account) is even<br>like a snake of virulent poison? O thou of high vows, I would not, even<br>from fear of Vasava, forsake duty! Be gracious unto me, or do me without<br>delay that which thou hast thought proper. This sloka also, O thou of<br>pure soul, is heard in the Puranas, O lord, sung by the high-souled<br>Marutta, O thou of great intelligence! The renunciation is sanctioned by<br>the ordinance of a preceptor who is filled with vanity, who is destitute<br>of the knowledge of right and wrong, and who is treading in a devious<br>path.&#8212;Thou art my preceptor and it is for this that I have from love<br>reverenced thee greatly. Thou, however, knowest not the duty of a<br>preceptor, and it is for this that I will fight with thee. I would not<br>slay any preceptor in battle, especially again a Brahmana, and more<br>specially one endued with ascetic merit. It was for this that I forgive<br>thee. It is well-known truth, gatherable from the scriptures, that he is<br>not guilty of slaying a Brahmana who killeth in battle a person of that<br>order that taketh up weapons like Kshatriya and fighteth wrathfully<br>without seeking to fly. I am a Kshatriya stationed in the practice of<br>Kshatriya duties. One doth not incur sin, nor doth one incur any harm by<br>behaving towards a person exactly as that person deserveth. When a person<br>acquainted with the proprieties of time and place and well-versed in<br>matters affecting both profit and virtue, feels doubtful, as regards<br>anything, he should without scruples of any kind, devote himself to the<br>acquisition of virtue which would confer the highest benefit on him. And<br>since thou, O Rama, in a matter connected with profit of doubtful<br>propriety, actest unrighteously, I would certainly fight with thee in a<br>great battle. Behold the strength of my arms and my prowess that is<br>superhuman! In view of such circumstances, I shall certainly do, O son of<br>Bhrigu, what I can. I shall fight with thee, O regenerate one, on the<br>field of Kurukshetra! O Rama of great effulgence, equip thyself as thou<br>listest for single combat! Come and station thyself on the field of<br>Kurukshetra where, afflicted with my shafts in great battle, and<br>sanctified by my weapons, thou mayest obtain those regions that have been<br>won by thee (thought for thy austerities). O thou of mighty arms and<br>wealth of asceticism, there I will approach thee for battle,&#8212;thee that<br>art so fond of battle! There, O Rama, where in days of yore thou hadst<br>propitiated thy (deceased) fathers (with oblations of Kshatriya blood),<br>slaying thee there, O son of Bhrigu, I will propitiate the Kshatriya<br>slain by thee! Come there, O Rama, without delay! There, O thou that art<br>difficult of being vanquished, I will curb thy old pride about which the<br>Brahmanas speak! For many long years, O Rama, thou hast boasted,<br>saying,&#8212;I have, single-handed, vanquished all the Kshatriyas of the<br>Earth!&#8212;Listen now to what enabled thee to indulge in that boast! In<br>those days no Bhishma was born, or no Kshatriyas like unto Bhishma!<br>Kshatriyas really endued with valour have taken their births later on! As<br>regards thyself, thou hast consumed only heaps of straw! The person that<br>would easily quell thy pride of battle hath since been born! He, O<br>mighty-armed one, is no other than myself, even Bhishma, that subjugator<br>of hostile cities! Without doubt, O Rama, I shall just quell thy pride of<br>battle!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Hearing these words of mine. Rama addressed me,<br>laughingly saying, 'By good luck it is, O Bhishma, that thou desirest to<br>fight with me in battle! O thou of Kuru's race, even now I go with thee<br>to Kurukshetra! I will do what thou hast said! Come thither, O chastiser<br>of foes! Let thy mother, Jahnavi, O Bhishma, behold thee dead on that<br>plain, pierced with my shafts, and become the food of vultures, crows,<br>and other carnivorous birds! Let that goddess worshipped by Siddhas and<br>Charanas, that blessed daughter of Bhagiratha, in the form of a river,<br>who begat thy wicked self, weep today, O king, beholding thee slain by me<br>and lying miserable on that plain, however undeserving she may be of<br>seeing such a sight! Come, O Bhishma, and follow me, O proud wight,<br>always longing for battle! O thou of Kuru's race, take with thee, O bull<br>of Bharatas' line, thy cars and all other equipments of battle!' Hearing<br>these words of Rama that subjugator of hostile towns, I worshipped him<br>with a bend of my head and answered him, saying,&#8212;So be it! Having said<br>all this, Rama then went to Kurukshetra from desire of combat, and I<br>also, entering our city, represented everything unto Satyavati. Then<br>causing propitiatory ceremonies to be performed (for my victory), and<br>being blessed also by my mother, and making the Brahmanas utter<br>benedictions on me, I mounted on a handsome car made of silver and unto<br>which, O thou of great glory, were yoked steeds white in hue. And every<br>part of that car was well-built, and it was exceedingly commodious and<br>covered on all sides with tiger-skin. And it was equipped with many great<br>weapons and furnished with all necessaries. And it was ridden by<br>charioteer who was well-born and brave, who was versed in horse-lore,<br>careful in battle, and well-trained in his art, and who had seen many<br>encounters. And I was accoutred in a coat of mail, white in hue, and had<br>my bow in hand. And the bow I took was also white in hue. And thus<br>equipped, I set out, O best of Bharata's race! And an umbrella, white in<br>hue, was held over my head. And, O king, I was fanned with fans that also<br>were white in colour. And clad in white, with also a white head-gear, all<br>my adornments were white. And eulogised (with laudatory hymns) by<br>Brahmanas wishing me victory. I issued out of the city named after the<br>elephant, and proceeded to Kurukshetra, which, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>was to be the field of battle! And those steeds, fleet as the mind or the<br>wind, urged by my charioteer, soon bore me, O king, to that great<br>encounter. And arrived in the field of Kurukshetra, both myself and Rama,<br>eager for battle, became desirous of showing each other our prowess. And<br>arrived within view of the great ascetic Rama, I took up my excellent<br>conch and blew a loud blast. And many Brahmanas, O king, and many<br>ascetics having their abodes in the forest, as also the gods with Indra<br>at their head, were stationed there for beholding the great encounter.<br>And many celestial garlands and diverse kinds of celestial music and many<br>cloudy canopies could be noticed there. And all those ascetics who had<br>come with Rama, desiring to become spectators of the fight, stood all<br>around the field. Just at this juncture, O king, my divine mother devoted<br>to the good of all creatures, appeared before me in her own form and<br>said, 'What is this that thou seekest to do? Repairing to Jamadagni's<br>son, O son of Kuru's race, I will repeatedly solicit him saying,&#8212;Do not<br>fight Bhishma who is thy disciple!&#8212;O son, being a Kshatriya do not<br>obstinately set thy heart on an encounter in battle with Jamadagni's son<br>who is a Brahmana!' Indeed, it was thus that she reproved me. And she<br>also said, 'O son, Rama, equal in prowess unto Mahadeva himself, is the<br>exterminator of the Kshatriya order! It is not known to thee, that thou<br>desirest an encounter with him.' Thus addressed by her, I saluted the<br>goddess reverentially and replied unto her with joined hands, giving her,<br>O chief of the Bharatas, an account of all that had transpired in that<br>self-choice (of the daughter of Kasi). I also told her every thing, O<br>king of kings, about how I had urged Rama (to desist from the combat). I<br>also gave her a history of all the past acts of the (eldest) daughter of<br>Kasi. My mother then, the great River, wending to Rama, began, for my<br>sake, to beseech the Rishi of Bhrigu's race. And she said unto him these<br>words, viz.,&#8212;Do not fight Bhishma who is thy disciple!&#8212;Rama, however,<br>said unto her while she was beseeching him thus, 'Go and make Bhishma<br>desist! He doth not execute out my wish! It is for this that I have<br>challenged him!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by Rama, Ganga, from affection<br>for her son, came back to Bhishma. But Bhishma, with eyes rolling in<br>anger, refused to do her bidding. Just at this time, the mighty ascetic<br>Rama, that foremost one of Bhrigu's race, appeared in Bhishma's sight. An<br>then that best of the twice-born ones challenged him to the encounter.'"
