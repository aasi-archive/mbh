                            "Narada said, 'As soon as that bull among men, king Yayati was recognised<br>by those virtuous persons, he rose again to heaven, without having had to<br>touch the surface of the earth. And he regained his celestial form and<br>had all his anxieties entirely dispelled. And he rose again, decked with<br>celestial garlands and robes, adorned with celestial ornaments, sprinkled<br>with celestial scents, and furnished with heavenly attributes, and<br>without having been compelled to touch the earth with his feet.<br>Meanwhile, Vasumanas who was celebrated in the world for his liberality,<br>first addressing the king, uttered these words in a loud voice, 'The<br>merit that I have won on earth by my unblamable conduct towards men of<br>all orders, I give unto thee. Be it all thine, O king. The merit that one<br>winneth by liberality and forgiveness, the merit that is mine in<br>consequence of the sacrifices I have performed, let all that also be<br>thine.' After this, Pratardana, that bull among Kshatriyas, said, 'Ever<br>devoted to virtue as also to war, the fame that hath here been mine as a<br>Kshatriya, in consequence of the appellation of hero (by which I am<br>known),&#8212;be that merit thine. After this, Sivi, the intelligent son of<br>Usinara, said these sweet words, 'Unto children and women in jest,<br>danger, or calamity, in distress, or at dice, I have never spoken a<br>falsehood. By that truth which I never sacrificed ascend thou to heaven.<br>I can, O king, give up all objects of desire and enjoyment, my kingdom,<br>yea, life itself, but truth I cannot give up. By that truth, ascend thou<br>to heaven; that truth for which Dharma, that truth for which agni, that<br>truth for which he of a hundred sacrifices, have each been gratified with<br>me, by that truth ascend thou to heaven.' And lastly, the royal sage<br>Ashtaka, the offspring of Kusika's son and Madhavi, addressing Nahusha's<br>son Yayati who had performed many hundreds of sacrifices, said, 'I have,<br>O lord, performed hundreds of Pundarika, Gosava and Vajapeya sacrifices.<br>Take thou the merit of these. Wealth, gems, robes, I have spared nothing<br>for the performance of sacrifices. By that truth ascend thou to heaven.'<br>And that king thereupon leaving the earth, began to ascend towards<br>heaven, higher and higher, as those daughter's sons of his, one after<br>another, said those words unto him. And it was thus that those kings by<br>their good acts, speedily saved Yayati, who had been hurled from heaven.<br>It was thus that those daughter's sons born in four royal lines, those<br>multipliers of their races, by means of their virtues, sacrifices, and<br>gifts, caused their wise maternal grandfather to ascend again to heaven.<br>And those monarchs jointly said, 'Endued with the attributes of royalty<br>and possessed of every virtue, we are, O king, thy daughter's sons! (By<br>virtue of our good deeds) ascend thou to heaven.'"
