                            "Bhishma said, 'Thus addressed, O king, by that messenger, king Drupada,<br>like a thief caught (in the act), could not speak. He exerted himself<br>greatly, by sending sweet-speeched emissaries with his own instruction to<br>them, saying,&#8212;This is not so,&#8212;in order to pacify his brother. King<br>Hiranyavarman, however, ascertaining once again, that the child of the<br>king of the Panchalas was really a daughter, issued out of his city<br>without losing any time. He then sent messages unto all his powerful<br>friends about that deception practised on his daughter, of which he had<br>heard from her nurses. Then, that best of kings, having mustered a large<br>army, resolved, O Bharata, to march against Drupada. Then, O monarch,<br>king Hiranyavarman held a consultation with his ministers about the ruler<br>of the Panchalas. And it was settled among those high-souled kings that<br>if, O monarch, Sikhandin was really a daughter, they should bind the<br>ruler of the Panchalas and drag him from his city, and installing another<br>king over the Panchalas they should slay Drupada with Sikhandin. Taking<br>that to be the fixed resolution (of all whom he had summoned) king<br>Hiranyavarman once more sent an envoy to the descendant of Prishata,<br>saying 'I will slay thee, be calm.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'King Drupada was not naturally courageous. In<br>consequence, again, of that offence of his, he became filled with fear.<br>Sending his envoys again to the ruler of the Dasarnakas, king Drupada,<br>afflicted with grief, approached his wife and took counsel with her. And<br>possessed with great fright and with heart afflicted with grief, the king<br>of the Panchalas said unto his favourite wife, the mother of Sikhandin,<br>these words, 'My powerful brother, king Hiranyavarman, having mustered a<br>large force, is coming towards me in anger. Fools that we both are, what<br>are we now to do in respect of this our daughter? Thy son, Sikhandin,<br>hath been suspected to be a daughter. Under this suspicion, Hiranyavarman<br>with his allies and followed by his army wisheth to slay me thinking that<br>he hath been received by me! O thou of beautiful hips, tell us now what<br>is true or false in this, O beautiful lady! O blessed lady, hearing from<br>thee first, I will settle how to act. I am very much endangered and this<br>child, Sikhandin, also is equally so. Indeed, O queen, O lady of the<br>fairest complexion, thou too art threatened with danger! For the relief<br>of all, tell me who asketh thee what the truth is! O thou of beautiful<br>hips and sweet smiles, hearing what thou hast to say I shall act<br>suitably. Although I have been deceived by thee as to the duties I owe<br>towards a son, yet, O beautiful lady, from kindness I will act towards<br>you both in a suitable manner. Therefore, do not fear, nor let this<br>daughter of thine fear anything. Indeed, I have deceived the king of the<br>Dasarnakas. Tell me, O highly blessed lady, how may I act towards him so<br>that all may yet turn up well!' Indeed, although the king knew<br>everything, yet he addressed his wife in the presence of others in this<br>way, to proclaim his own innocence before others. His queen then answered<br>him in the following words.'"
