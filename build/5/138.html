                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing the words of Kunti, the mighty car-warriors,<br>Bhishma and Drona, then spoke these words unto the disobedient<br>Duryodhana, 'Hast thou, O tiger among men, heard the fierce words of<br>grave import, excellent and consistent with virtue, that Kunti had spoken<br>in the presence of Krishna? Her sons will act according to them,<br>especially as they are approved by Vasudeva. O Kaurava, they will not<br>assuredly desist, without their share of the kingdom (being given to<br>them). Thou hast inflicted much pain on the sons of Pritha. And Draupadi<br>also was afflicted by thee in the assembly. They were, however, bound<br>then by the bounds of truth and it was for this that, they tolerated that<br>treatment. Obtaining Arjuna now, who is skilled in every weapon, and<br>Bhima of firm resolution, and Gandiva and the couple of (inexhaustible)<br>quivers, and that car (of Arjuna) and that banner (bearing the device of<br>the ape), and Nakula and Sahadeva, both endued with great might and<br>energy, and Vasudeva also, as his allies, Yudhishthira will not forgive<br>(thee). O mighty-armed one, thou hast witnessed with thy own eyes how<br>intelligent Arjuna vanquished us all in battle before, in the city of<br>Virata. Indeed, after this, that Ape-bannered (warrior) consumed in<br>battle, taking up his fierce weapons, those Danavas of terrible deeds<br>called the Nivatakavachas. On the occasion also of the tale of cattle,<br>when captured by the Gandharvas, this Karna and all these thy counsellors<br>and thyself accoutred in mail and on thy car, were all liberated from the<br>grasp of the Gandharvas by that Arjuna. That is a sufficient proof.<br>Therefore, O foremost of the Bharatas, with all thy brothers make peace<br>with the sons of Pandu. Save this whole earth from the Destruction's<br>jaws. Yudhishthira is thy elder brother, virtuous in behaviour,<br>affectionate towards thee, sweet-speeched and learned. Abandoning thy<br>sinful intentions, unite thyself with that tiger among men. If Pandu's<br>son beholdeth thee divested of thy bow, and without the wrinkles of rage<br>on thy brow, and cheerful, even that would be for the good of our race.<br>Approaching with all thy counsellors embrace him fraternally. O repressor<br>of foes, salute the king respectfully as before. And let Yudhishthira,<br>the son of Kunti, the elder brother of Bhima, hold from affection, thy<br>saluting self with his arms. And let that foremost of smiters, Bhima,<br>possessed of leonine shoulders and thighs round, and long, and mighty<br>arms, embrace thee. And then let that son of Kunti, Dhananjaya, called<br>also Partha, of eyes like lotus-petals, and curly hair and conch-like<br>neck salute thee respectfully. Then let those tigers among men, the twin<br>Aswins, unrivalled on earth for beauty, wait on thee with affection and<br>reverence as on their preceptor. And let all the kings with him of<br>Dasarha's race at their head, shed tears of joy. Abandoning thy pride,<br>unite thyself with thy brothers. Rule thou the whole earth, with thy<br>brothers. Let all the kings joyfully return to their respective homes,<br>having embraced one another. There is no need of battle, O king of kings.<br>Listen to the dissuasions of thy friends. In the battle that will ensue a<br>great destruction of the Kshatriyas is certainly indicated. The stars are<br>all hostile. The animals and birds have all assumed fearful aspects.<br>Diverse portents, O hero, are visible, all indicating the slaughters of<br>the Kshatriyas. All these portents, again, are particularly visible in<br>our abodes. Blazing meteors are afflicting thy host. Our animals are all<br>cheerless and seem, O king, to be crying. Vultures are wheeling around<br>thy troops. Neither the city nor the palace looks as before. Jackals,<br>setting forth ominous yells, are running about the four quarters which<br>are ablaze with conflagrations. Obey thou the counsels of thy father and<br>mother as also of ourselves who are thy well-wishers. War and peace, O<br>thou of mighty arms, are within thy control. If, O grinder of foes, thou<br>dost not act according to the words of thy friends, thou shalt have to<br>repent upon beholding thy army afflicted with the arrows of Partha.<br>Hearing in battle the terrible yells uttered by the mighty Bhima and the<br>twang of Gandiva, thou wilt remember our these words. Indeed, if what we<br>say appears unacceptable to thee, then it will be as we say.'"
