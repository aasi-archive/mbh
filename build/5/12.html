                            "Salya said, 'Seeing Nahusha enraged, the gods led by the saints spoke<br>unto him, 'Who was now their king of awful mien? O king of gods, quit thy<br>wrath. When thou art in wrath, O lord, the Universe, with its Asuras and<br>Gandharvas, its Kinnaras, and great snakes, quaketh. Quit this wrath,<br>thou righteous being. Persons like thee do not put themselves out. That<br>goddess is another person's wife. Be pacified, O lord of gods! Turn back<br>thy inclination from the sin of outraging another's wife. Thou art the<br>king of gods, prosperity to thee! Protect thy subjects in all<br>righteousness?' So addressed, he heeded not the saying rendered senseless<br>by lust. And the king spoke to the gods, in allusion to Indra, 'Ahalya of<br>spotless fame, the wife of a saint, was outraged by Indra while her<br>husband was alive. Why did ye not prevent him? Many were the deeds of<br>inhumanity, of unrighteousness, of deceit, committed by Indra in former<br>times. Why did ye not prevent him? Let the goddess do my pleasure; that<br>would be her permanent good. And so the same will ever more rebound to<br>your safety, ye gods!'<br><br>"The gods said, 'We shall bring to thee the queen of Indra even as thou<br>hast laid the command, 'O lord of heaven! Quit this wrath, thou valiant<br>soul! Be pacified, O lord of gods!'<br><br>"Salya continued, 'Thus having spoken to him, the gods with the saint<br>went to inform Vrihaspati and the queen of Indra of the said news. And<br>they said, 'We know, O foremost of Brahmanas, that the queen of Indra<br>hath betaken herself to thy house, for protection, and that thou hast<br>promised her protection, O best of divine saints! But we, the gods and<br>Gandharvas and saints, beseech thee, O thou of great lustre, to give up<br>the queen of Indra to Nahusha. Nahusha, the king of gods, of great<br>effulgence, is superior to Indra. Let her, that lady of choice figure and<br>complexion, choose him as her lord!' Thus addressed, the goddess gave<br>vent to tears; and sobbing audibly, she mourned in piteous accents. And<br>she spoke to Vrihaspati, 'O best of divine saints, I do not desire<br>Nahusha to be my lord. I have betaken myself to thy protection, O<br>Brahmana! Deliver me from this great peril!'<br><br>"Vrihaspati said, 'My resolution is this, I shall not abandon one that<br>hath sought my protection. O thou of unblamable life, I shall not abandon<br>thee, virtuous as thou art and of a truthful disposition! I do not desire<br>to do an improper act, specially as I am a Brahmana knowing what<br>righteousness is, having a regard for truth, and aware also of the<br>precepts of virtue. I shall never do it. Go your ways, ye best of gods.<br>Hear what hath formerly been sung by Brahma with regard to the matter at<br>hand. He that delivereth up to a foe of a person terrified and asking for<br>protection obtaineth no protection when he himself is in need of it. His<br>seed doth not grow at seed-time and rain doth not come to him in the<br>season of rains. He that delivereth up to a foe a person terrified and<br>asking for protection never succeedeth in anything that he undertaketh;<br>senseless as he is, he droppeth paralysed from heaven; the god refuse<br>offerings made by him. His progeny die an untimely death and his<br>forefathers always quarrel (among themselves). The gods with Indra and<br>their head dart the thunderbolt at him. Know it to be so, I shall not<br>deliver up this Sachi here, the queen of Indra, famous in the world as<br>his favourite consort. O ye best of gods, what may be for both her good<br>and mine I ask you to do. Sachi I shall never deliver up!'<br><br>"Salya continued, 'Then the gods and the Gandharvas said these words to<br>the preceptor of the gods, 'O Vrihaspati, deliberate upon something that<br>may be conformable to sound policy!' Vrihaspati said, 'Let this goddess<br>of auspicious looks ask for time from Nahusha in order to make up her<br>mind to his proposal. This will be for the good of Indra's queen, and of<br>us as well. Time, ye gods, may give rise to many impediments. Time will<br>send time onward. Nahusha is proud and powerful by virtue of the boon<br>granted to him!'<br><br>"Salya continued, 'Vrihaspati having spoken so, the gods, delighted then<br>said, 'Well hast thou said, O Brahmana. This is for the good of all the<br>gods. It is no doubt so. Only, let this goddess be propitiated.' Then the<br>assembled gods led by Agni, with a view to the welfare of all the worlds,<br>spoke to Indra's queen in a quiet way. And the gods said, 'Thou art<br>supporting the whole universe of things mobile and immobile. Thou art<br>chaste and true: go thou to Nahusha. That vicious being, lustful after<br>thee, will shortly fall: and Indra, O goddess, will get the sovereignty<br>of the gods!' Ascertaining this to be the result of that deliberation,<br>Indra's queen, for attaining her end, went bashfully to Nahusha of awful<br>mien. The vicious Nahusha also, rendered senseless by lust, saw how<br>youthful and lovely she was, and became highly pleased.'
