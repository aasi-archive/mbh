                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Coming back to Upaplavya from Hastinapura, that<br>chastiser of foes, Kesava, represented unto the Pandavas all that had<br>happened, and conferring with them for a long space of time, and holding<br>repeated consultations, Sauri went to his own quarters for rest. And<br>dismissing all the kings, with Virata and others at their heads, the five<br>brothers&#8212;the Pandavas&#8212;when the sun had set, said their evening prayers.<br>And with hearts ever fixed on Krishna they began to think of him. And, at<br>last, bringing Krishna of Dasarha's race into their midst, they began to<br>deliberate again about what they should do. And Yudhishthira said, 'O<br>thou of eyes like lotus-petals, it behoveth thee to tell us all that thou<br>saidst unto Dhritarashtra's son in the assembly (of the Kurus), having<br>gone to Nagapura.' Vasudeva said, 'Having gone to Nagapura, I addressed<br>Dhritarashtra's son in the assembly such words as were true, reasonable,<br>and beneficial. That wicked minded fellow did not, however, accept them.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'When Duryodhana desired to tread along the wrong<br>path, what did the aged Kuru grandsire say, O Hrishikesa, unto that<br>vindictive prince? What also did the highly-blessed preceptor&#8212;the son of<br>Bharadwaja, say? And what did his parents Dhritarashtra and Gandhari say?<br>What did our junior father Kshattri, who is the foremost of all persons<br>conversant with virtue, and who is always afflicted with sorrow on<br>account of ourselves whom he regards as his sons, say unto<br>Dhritarashtra's son? What also did all the kings who sat in that assembly<br>say? O Janardana, say it all unto us, exactly as it happened. Thou hast<br>already told us all the disagreeable words that the Kuru chiefs (Bhishma<br>and Dhritarashtra) and others in that assembly of the Kurus said unto the<br>wicked Duryodhana who is overwhelmed with lust and covetousness, and who<br>regardeth himself wise. Those words, however, O Kesava, have flitted away<br>from my memory. O Govinda, I desire to hear, O lord, all those words<br>again. Act thou in such a way that the opportunity may not pass away.<br>Thou, O Krishna, art our refuge, thou art our lord, thou art our guide!'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'Hear, O king, the words that were addressed to king<br>Suyodhana in the midst of the assembly of the Kurus, and, O king of<br>kings, bear them in thy mind. After my words were ended, Dhritarashtra's<br>son laughed aloud. Highly incensed at this, Bhishma then said, 'Hear, O<br>Duryodhana, what I say for (the preservation of) our race, and having<br>heard it, O tiger among kings, do what is beneficial to thy own house. O<br>sire, O king, my father Santanu, was widely known in the world. I was, at<br>first, his only son. A desire sprung up in his heart as to how he might<br>obtain a second son, for the wise say that an only son is no son,&#8212;Let<br>not my race be extinct may my fame be spread. Even this was his desire.<br>Knowing this to have been his desire, I procured Kali to become my<br>mother, having myself made a promise highly difficult to observe, for the<br>sake of my father as also for the sake of our race. How, in consequence<br>of that promise I could not be king and have drawn up my vital seed, are,<br>of course, well-known to thee. (I do not grieve for that). Observing that<br>vow of mine, behold, I am living in happiness and joy. In her, O king,<br>was born my younger brother, that mighty-armed and handsome supporter of<br>Kuru's race, viz., Vichitravirya of virtuous soul. After my father's<br>ascension to heaven, I installed Vichitravirya as a ruler of the kingdom,<br>that was mine, while I placed myself under him as a servant of his. O<br>king of kings, I then brought him suitable wives, having vanquished many<br>assembled monarchs. Thou hast heard of it often. Sometime after, I was<br>engaged in a single combat with the (great) Rama. From fear of Rama, my<br>brother fled, the more so as his subject deserted him. During this<br>period, he became very much attached to his wives and accordingly had an<br>attack of phthisis. Upon his death, there was anarchy in the kingdom and<br>the chief of the gods poured not a drop of rain (on the realm).' The<br>subjects then, afflicted by fear of hunger, hastened to me and said, 'Thy<br>subjects are on the point of being exterminated. Be thou our king for the<br>sake of our good. Dispel this drought. Blessed be thou, O perpetuator of<br>Santanu's race. Thy subjects are being greatly afflicted by severe and<br>frightful maladies. Very few of them are still alive. It behoveth thee, O<br>son of Ganga, to save them. Dispel these tortures. O hero, cherish thy<br>subjects righteously. When thou art alive, let not the kingdom go to<br>destruction.' Hearing these words of theirs uttered in a weeping voice,<br>my heart was undisturbed. Remembering the behaviour of good, I desired to<br>maintain my vow. Then, O king, the citizens, my auspicious mother Kali<br>herself, our servants, the priests and the preceptors (of our house), and<br>many Brahmanas of great learning, all afflicted with great woe, solicited<br>me to occupy the throne.' And they said, 'When thou art alive, shall the<br>kingdom, ruled by Pratipa (of old), go to ruin? O thou of magnanimous<br>heart, be thou the king for our good.' Thus addressed by them, I joined<br>my hands together and, myself filled with grief and greatly afflicted, I<br>represented to them the vow I had made from filial respect. I repeatedly<br>informed them that for the sake of our race, I had vowed to live with<br>vital seed drawn up and foreswearing the throne. It was especially for my<br>mother, again, that I did so. I, therefore, begged them not to put me to<br>the yoke. I again joined my hands and conciliated my mother, saying, 'O<br>mother, begot by Santanu and being a member of Kuru's race, I cannot<br>falsify my promise.' I repeatedly told her this. And, O king, I said<br>further, It is for thee especially, O mother, that I took this vow; I am<br>verily thy servant and slave, O mother, thou that art distinguished for<br>parental affection.' Having begged my mother and the people thus, I then<br>solicited the great sage Vyasa for begetting children upon the wives of<br>my brother. Indeed, O king, both myself and my mother gratified that<br>Rishi. At last, O king, the Rishi granted our prayers in the matter of<br>the children. And he begot three sons in all, O best of Bharata's race.<br>Thy father was born blind, and in consequence of this congenital defect<br>of a sense, he could not become king. The high-souled and celebrated<br>Pandu became king. And when Pandu became king, his sons must obtain their<br>paternal inheritance. O sire, do not quarrel, give them half the kingdom.<br>When I am alive, what other man is competent to reign? Do not disregard<br>my words. I only wish that there should be peace amongst you. O sire, O<br>king, I make no distinction between thee and then (but love all of you<br>equally). What I have said unto thee represents also the opinion of thy<br>father, of Gandhari, and also of Vidura. The words of those that are old<br>should always be listened to. Do not disregard these words of mine. Do<br>not destroy all thou hast and the earth also.'"
