                            "The mother said, 'Into whatever calamity a king may fail, he should not<br>still betray it. Beholding the king afflicted with fright, the whole<br>kingdom, the army, the counsellors, all yield to fear, and all the<br>subjects become disunited. Some go and embrace the side of the enemy;<br>others simply abandon the king; and others again, that had before been<br>humiliated, strive to strike. They, however, that are intimate friends<br>wait by his side, and though desiring his welfare yet from inability to<br>do anything wait helplessly, like a cow whose calf hath been tethered. As<br>friends grieve for friends that are plunged into distress, so those<br>well-wishers also grieve upon beholding their lord plunged into grief.<br>Even thou hast many friends whom thou hadst worshipped before. Even thou<br>hast many friends after thy heart, who feel for thy kingdom and who<br>desire to take a state of thy calamities on themselves. Do not frighten<br>those friends, and do not suffer them to abandon thee on beholding thee<br>afflicted with fear. Desiring to test thy might, manliness, and<br>understanding, and wishing also to encourage thee, I have said all this<br>for enhancing thy energy. If thou understandest what I have said, and if<br>all I have said appears proper and sufficient, then, O Sanjaya, muster<br>thy patience and gird up thy lions for victory. We have a large number of<br>treasure-houses unknown to thee. I alone know of their existence, and no<br>other person. I will place all these at thy disposal. Thou hast also, O<br>Sanjaya, more than one friend who sympathise with thee in thy joys and<br>woes, and who, O hero, never retreat from the field of battle. O grinder<br>of foes, allies such as these, always play the part of faithful<br>counsellors to a person who seeketh his own welfare and desireth to<br>acquire what is agreeable to himself.'<br><br>"Kunti continued, 'Hearing this speech of his mother fraught with<br>excellent words, and sense, the despair that had overtaken Sanjaya's<br>heart left instantly, although that prince was not gifted with great<br>intelligence. And the son said, 'When I have thee that are so observant<br>of my future welfare for my guide, I shall certainly either rescue my<br>paternal kingdom that is sunk in water or perish in the attempt. During<br>thy discourse I was almost a silent listener. Now and then only I<br>interposed a word. It was, however, only with the view of drawing thee<br>out, so that I might hear more on the subject. I have not been satiated<br>with thy words, like a person not satiated with drinking amrita. Deriving<br>support from any allies, behold, I gird up my loins for repressing my<br>foes and obtaining victory.'<br><br>"Kunti continued, 'Pierced by the wordy arrows of his mother, the son<br>roused himself like a steed of proud mettle and achieved all that his<br>mother had pointed out. When a king is afflicted by foes and overcome<br>with despair, his minister should make him hear this excellent history<br>that enhanceth energy and inspireth might. Indeed, this history is called<br>Jaya and should be listened to by every one desirous of victory. Indeed,<br>having listened to it, one may soon subjugate the whole earth and grind<br>his foes. This history causeth a woman to bring forth a heroic son, the<br>woman quick with child that listeneth to it repeatedly, certainly giveth<br>birth to a hero. The Kshatriya woman that listeneth to it bringeth forth<br>a brave son of irresistible prowess, one that is foremost in learning,<br>foremost in ascetic austerities, foremost in liberality, devoted to<br>asceticism, blazing forth with Brahmic beauty, enumerable with the good,<br>radiant with effulgence, endued with great might, blessed, a mighty<br>car-warrior, possessed of great intelligence, irresistible (in battle),<br>ever victorious, invincible, a chastiser of the wicked and a protector of<br>all practisers of virtue.'"
