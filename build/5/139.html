                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Thus addressed by them, Duryodhana, contracting the<br>space between his eye-brows, became cheerless, and with face bent down<br>began to cast oblique glances. And he said not a word in reply. Beholding<br>him cheerless, those bulls among men, Bhishma and Drona, looking at each<br>other, once more addressed him, and said (these words).'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'What can be a matter of greater grief to us than that we<br>shall have to light against that Yudhishthira who is devoted to the<br>service of his superiors, destitute of envy, conversant with Brahma, and<br>truthful in speech.'<br><br>"Drona said, 'My affection for Dhananjaya is greater than that which I<br>bear for my son Aswatthaman. There is greater reverence also and humility<br>(towards me) in that Ape-bannered hero (than in Aswatthaman). Alas, in<br>observance of the Kshatriya duties, I shall have to light even against<br>that Dhananjaya who is dearer to me than my son. Fie on the Kshatriya<br>profession. That Vibhatsu who hath no other bowman in the world as his<br>equal, hath, through my grace, acquired this superiority over all bowmen.<br>He that hateth his friends, he that is of wicked disposition, he that<br>denieth Godhead, he that is crooked and deceitful, never obtaineth the<br>worship of the righteous, like an ignorant person present at a sacrifice.<br>Though dissuaded from sin, a sinful man would still wish to commit sinful<br>acts; while he that is righteous, though tempted by sin, would not yet<br>abandon righteousness. Though thou hast conducted thyself with falsehood<br>and deceit towards them, the Pandavas are still desirous of doing what is<br>agreeable to thee. As regards thyself, O thou best of the Bharatas, all<br>thy faults are calculated to bring about disasters on thee. Thou hast<br>been addressed by the eldest of the Kurus, by me, by Vidura, and by<br>Vasudeva. Thou dost not yet understand what is beneficial for thyself. I<br>have a large force,&#8212;with this conviction thou desirest to pierce the<br>Pandava host, abounding with heroes, like the current of the Ganga<br>piercing the ocean abounding with sharks and alligators and makaras.<br>Having obtained Yudhishthira's prosperity like the cast off robes or<br>garlands of another, thou regardest it as thy own. If the son of Pritha<br>and Pandu stayeth even in the woods with Draupadi, and surrounded by his<br>armed brothers, who is there, even in the possession of a kingdom, that<br>is competent to vanquish him? In the presence of even that Ailavila<br>(Kuvera) under whose command all the Yakshas live as servants,<br>Yudhishthira the Just, shone with splendour. Having proceeded to Kuvera's<br>abode and having procured wealth therefrom, the Pandavas are now desirous<br>of attacking thy swelling kingdom and winning sovereignty for themselves.<br>(As regards us two), we have made gifts, poured libations on fire,<br>studied (the scriptures), and gratified the Brahmanas by presents of<br>wealth. The (allotted) periods of our life have also run out. Know that<br>our work has been done. (As regards thyself however), giving up<br>happiness, kingdom, friends, and wealth, great will be thy calamity if<br>thou seekest war with the Pandavas. How canst thou vanquish the son of<br>Pandu, when Draupadi who is truthful in speech and devoted to rigid vows<br>and austerities, prayeth for his success? How wilt thou vanquish that son<br>of Pandu who hath Janardana. for his counsellor, and who hath for a<br>brother that Dhananjaya who is the foremost of wielders of weapons? How<br>wilt thou vanquish that son of Pandu, of severe austerities, who hath for<br>his allies so many Brahmanas, endued with intelligence and mastery over<br>their senses? In accordance with what a prosperity-wishing friend should<br>do when he sees his friends sinking in an ocean of distress, I again tell<br>thee, there is no necessity for war. Make peace with those heroes for the<br>sake of prosperity to the Kurus. Do not court defeat, with thy sons,<br>counsellors, and the army!'"
