                            "Sanat-sujata said, 'The primary Seed (of the universe), called<br>Mahayasas, is destitute of accidents, is pure Knowledge, and blazeth with<br>effulgence. It leadeth the senses, and it is in consequence of that Seed<br>that Surya shineth. That Eternal One endued with Divinity is beheld by<br>Yogins (by their mental eye). It is in consequence of that Seed (which is<br>Joy's self) that Brahman becomes capable of Creation and it is through it<br>that Brahman increaseth in expansion. It is that Seed which entering into<br>luminous bodies giveth light and heat. Without deriving its light and<br>heat from any other thing it is self-luminous, and is an object of terror<br>to all luminous bodies. The Eternal One endued with Divinity is beheld by<br>Yogins (by their mental eye). The body composed of the five grosser<br>elements, that are themselves sprung from the five subtler ones,&#8212;the<br>latter, in their turn, originating in one homogeneous substance called<br>Brahman&#8212;is upheld (realised) in consciousness by both the creature-Soul<br>endued with life and Iswara. (These two, during sleep and the universal<br>dissolution, are deprived of consciousness). Brahman on the other hand,<br>which is never bereft of consciousness, and which is the Sun's Sun,<br>upholdeth both these two and also the Earth and the Heaven. The Eternal<br>One endued with Divinity is beheld by Yogins (by their mental eye). The<br>Seed upholdeth the two gods, the Earth and the Heaven, the Directions,<br>and the whole Universe. It is from that Seed that directions (points of<br>the compass) and rivers spring, and the vast seas also have derived their<br>origin. The Eternal One endued with Divinity is beheld by Yogins (by<br>their mental eye). The body is like a car destined to destruction. Its<br>acts, however, are undying. Tied to the wheels of that car (which are<br>represented by the acts of past lives), the senses, that are as steeds,<br>lead, through the region of consciousness, the man of wisdom towards that<br>Increate and Unchangeable One, that One endued with Divinity is beheld by<br>Yogins (by their mental eye). The form of that One cannot be displayed by<br>any comparison. None ever beholdeth Him by the eye. They that know him by<br>the rapt faculties, the mind, and the heart, become freed from death. The<br>Eternal One endued with Divinity is beheld by Yogins (by their mental<br>eye). The stream of illusion is terrible; guarded by the gods, it hath<br>twelve fruits. Drinking of its waters and beholding many sweet things in<br>its midst, men swim along it to and fro. This stream flows from that<br>Seed. That Eternal One endued with Divinity is beheld by Yogins (by their<br>mental eye). Destined to sojourn to and fro, the creature-Soul, having<br>reflected enjoyeth (in the other world) only half of the fruits of his<br>acts. It is that creature-Soul which is Iswara, pervading everything in<br>the universe. It is Iswara that hath ordained sacrifices. That Eternal<br>One endued with Divinity is beheld by Yogins (by their mental eye). Souls<br>divested of accidents, resorting to Avidya, which is like unto a tree of<br>golden foliage, assume accidents, and take births in different orders<br>according to their propensities. That Eternal One endued with Divinity<br>(in Whom all those Souls are united) is beheld by Yogins (by their mental<br>eye). Accidents (which coming in contact with Brahman make the latter<br>assume many forms) raise the universe in its Fulness from that Brahman<br>which is full. Those accidents also, in their Fulness, arise from Brahman<br>in its Fulness. When one succeeds in dispelling all accidents from<br>Brahman which is ever Full, that which remains is Brahman in its Fulness.<br>That Eternal One endued with Divinity is beheld by Yogins (by their<br>mental eye). It is from that Seed that the five elements have arisen, and<br>it is in it that the power resideth for controlling them. It is from that<br>Seed that both the consumer and the consumed (called Agni and Soma) have<br>sprung, and it is in it that the living organisms with the senses rest.<br>Everything should be regarded to have sprung from it. That Seed called in<br>the Vedas TATH (Tad), we are unable to describe. That Eternal One endued<br>with Divinity is beheld by Yogins (by their mental eye). The vital air<br>called Apana is swallowed up by the Air called Prana; Prana is swallowed<br>up by the Will, and the Will by the Intellect, and the Intellect by the<br>Supreme Soul. That Eternal One endued with Divinity is beheld by Yogins<br>(by their mental eye). The Supreme Soul endued with four legs, called<br>respectively Waking, Dream, profound Sleep, and Turiya, like unto a swan,<br>treading above the unfathomable ocean of worldly affairs doth not put<br>forth one leg that is hid deep. Unto him that beholdeth that leg (viz.,<br>Turiya) as put forth for the purpose of guiding the other three, both<br>death and emancipation are the same. That Eternal One endued with<br>Divinity is beheld by Yogins (by their mental eye). Of the measure of the<br>thumb, ever Full, and different from this eternal organism, coming in<br>contact with the Vital airs, the Will, the Intellect, and the ten Senses,<br>it moveth to and fro. That Supreme Controller, worthy of reverential<br>hymns, capable of everything when vested with accidents and the prime<br>cause of everything, is manifest as Knowledge in creature-Souls. Fools<br>alone do not behold him; that Eternal One endued with Divinity is beheld<br>by Yogins (by their mental eye). Among individuals there are those that<br>have obtained the mastery of their minds, and those that have not. Yet in<br>all men the Supreme Soul may be seen equally. Indeed, it resideth equally<br>in him that is emancipate and in him that is not, with only this<br>difference that they that are emancipate obtain honey flowing in a thick<br>jet. That Eternal One endued with Divinity is beheld by Yogins (by their<br>mental eye). When one maketh life's Sojourn, having attained to the<br>knowledge of Self and Not-Self, then it matters little whether his<br>Agni-hotra is performed or not. O monarch, let not such words as 'I am<br>thy servant' fall from their lips. The Supreme Soul hath another name,<br>viz., Pure Knowledge. They only that have restrained their minds obtain<br>Him. That Eternal One endued with Divinity is beheld by Yogins (by their<br>mental eye). Even such is He. Illustrious and Full, all living creatures<br>are merged into Him. He that knoweth that embodiment of Fullness<br>attaineth to his object (emancipation) even here. That Eternal One endued<br>with Divinity is beheld by Yogins (by their mental eye). That which<br>flieth away stretching forth thousands of wings, yea, if endued with the<br>speed of the mind, must yet come back to the Central Spirit within the<br>living organism (in which the most distant things reside... That Eternal<br>One endued with Divinity) is beheld by Yogins (by their mental eye). His<br>form cannot be an object of sight. They only, that are of pure hearts,<br>can behold him. When one seeketh the good of all, succeedeth in<br>controlling his mind, and never suffereth his heart to be affected by<br>grief, then he is said to have purified his heart. Those again that can<br>abandon the world and all its cares, become immortal. (That Supreme Soul<br>which is undying),&#8212;that Eternal One endued with Divinity&#8212;is beheld by<br>Yogins (by their mental eye). Like serpents concealing themselves in<br>holes, there are persons who following the dictates of their preceptors,<br>or by their own conduct conceal their vices from scrutiny's gaze. They<br>that are of little sense are deceived by these. In fact, bearing<br>themselves outwardly without any impropriety, these deceive their victims<br>for leading them to hell. (Him, therefore, who may be attained by<br>companionship with persons of the very opposite class), that Eternal One<br>endued with Divinity&#8212;is beheld by Yogins (by their mental eye). He that<br>is emancipate thinks,&#8212;this transitory organism can never make me liable<br>to joy and grief and the other attributes inhering to it: nor can there<br>be, in my case, anything like death and birth: and, further, when<br>Brahman, which hath no opposing force to contend against and which is<br>alike in all times and all places, constitutes the resting-place of both<br>realities and unrealities, how can emancipation be mine? It is I alone<br>that am the origin and the end of all causes and effects.&#8212;(Existing in<br>the form of I or Self) that Eternal One endued with Divinity is beheld by<br>Yogins (by their mental eye). The Brahman-knowing person, who is equal<br>unto Brahman itself, is neither glorified by good acts nor defiled by bad<br>ones. It is only in ordinary men that acts, good or bad, produce<br>different results. The person that knoweth Brahman should be regarded as<br>identical with Amrita or the state called Kaivalya which is incapable of<br>being affected by either virtue or vice. One should, therefore, disposing<br>his mind in the way indicated, attain to that essence of sweetness<br>(Brahman). That Eternal One endued with Divinity is beheld by Yogins (by<br>their mental eye). Slander grieveth not the heart of the person that<br>knoweth Brahman not the thought&#8212;I have not studied (the Veda), or, I<br>have not performed my Agni-hotra. The knowledge of Brahman soon imparteth<br>to him that wisdom which they only obtain who have restrained their mind.<br>(That Brahman which freeth the Soul from grief and ignorance)-that<br>Eternal One endued with Divinity-is beheld by Yogins (by their mental<br>eye). He, therefore, that beholdeth his own Self in everything, hath no<br>longer to grieve, for they only have to grieve who are employed in<br>diverse other occupations of the world. As one's purposes (appeasing<br>thirst, etc.) may be served in a well as in a large reservoir or vast<br>expanse, so the various purposes of the Vedas may all be derivable by him<br>that knoweth the Soul. Dwelling in the heart, and of the measure of the<br>thumb, that illustrious One&#8212;the embodiment of Fullness&#8212;is not an object<br>of sight. Unborn he moveth, awake day and night. He that knoweth him,<br>becometh both learned and full of joy. I am called the mother and father.<br>I am again the son. Of all that was, and of all that we will be, I am the<br>Soul. O Bharata, I am the old grandsire, I am the father, I am the son.<br>Ye are staying in my soul, yet ye are not mine, nor am I yours! The Soul<br>is the cause of my birth and procreation. I am the warp and woof of the<br>universe. That upon which I rest is indestructible. Unborn I move, awake<br>day and night. It is I knowing whom one becometh both learned and full of<br>joy. Subtler than the subtle, of excellent eyes capable of looking into<br>both the past and the future, Brahman is awake in every creature. They<br>that knows Him know that Universal Father dwelleth in the heart of every<br>created thing!'"
