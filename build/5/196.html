                            "Sanjaya said, 'When the night passed away and morning came, thy sons<br>once more, in the midst of all the troops, asked their grandsire, saying,<br>'O son of Ganga, this army that is ready for fight, of Pandu's son, that<br>abounds with men, elephants, and steeds, that is crowded with Maharathas,<br>that is protected by these mighty bowmen endued with great strength,<br>viz., Bhima and Arjuna and others headed by Dhrishtadyumna and all<br>resembling the very regents of the world, that is invincible and<br>incapable of being withstood, that resembles the unbounded sea,&#8212;this sea<br>of warriors incapable of being agitated by the very gods in battle, in<br>how many days, O son of Ganga, O thou of great effulgence, canst thou<br>annihilate it, and in what time can that mighty bowman, our preceptor<br>(Drona), in what time also the mighty Kripa, in what time Karna who<br>taketh a pleasure in battle, and in what time that best of Brahmanas,<br>viz., the son of Drona, can each annihilate it? Ye that are in my army<br>are all acquainted with celestial weapons! I desire to know this, for the<br>curiosity I feel in my heart is great! O thou of mighty arms, it behoveth<br>thee to say this to me!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'O foremost one of the Kurus, O lord of the earth, thou<br>enquirest about the strength and weakness of the foe. This, indeed, is<br>worthy of thee. Listen, O king, as I tell thee the utmost limit of my<br>power in battle, or of the energy of my weapons, or of the might of my<br>arms, O thou of mighty arms! As regards ordinary combatants, one should<br>fight with them artlessly. As regards those that are possessed of powers<br>of deception, one should fight with them aided by the ways of deception.<br>Even this is what hath been laid down in respect of the duties of<br>warriors. I can annihilate the Pandava army, O blessed monarch, taking<br>every morning ten thousand (ordinary) warriors and one thousand<br>car-warriors as my share from day to day. Cased in mail and always<br>exerting myself actively, I can, O Bharata, annihilate this large force,<br>according to this arrangement as regards both number and time. If,<br>however, stationed in battle, I shoot my great weapons that slay hundreds<br>and thousands at a time, then I can, O Bharata, finish the slaughter in a<br>month.'<br><br>"Sanjaya continued, 'Hearing these words of Bhishma, king Duryodhana then<br>asked Drona, O monarch, that foremost one of Angira's race, saying, 'O<br>preceptor, in what time canst thou annihilate the troops of Pandu's son?'<br>Thus addressed by him, Drona said smilingly, 'I am old, O mighty-armed<br>one! My energy and activity have both become weak. With the fire of my<br>weapons I can consume the army of the Pandavas, like Santanu's son<br>Bhishma, I think, in a month's time.' Even this is the limit of my power,<br>even this is the limit of my strength.' Then Saradwat's son Kripa said<br>that he could annihilate the foe in two month's time. Dron's son<br>(Aswatthaman) pledged himself to annihilate the Pandava army in ten<br>nights, Karna, however, acquainted as he was with weapons of high<br>efficacy, pledged himself to achieve that feat in five days. Hearing the<br>words of the Suta's son the son of the ocean-going (Ganga) laughed aloud<br>and said, 'As long, O son of Radha, as thou encounterest not in battle<br>Partha with his arrows, conch, and bows and rushing to the combat on his<br>car with Vasudeva in his company, so long mayest thou think so! Why, thou<br>art capable of saying anything, even what thou pleasest!'"
