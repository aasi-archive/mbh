                            "Bhishma said, 'Next morning, O king, when the sun rose brightly, the<br>combat between myself and him of Bhrigu's race, again, commenced. Then<br>Rama, that foremost of smiters, stationed on his quickly-moving car,<br>rained on me a thick downpour of arrows like the clouds on the<br>mountain-breast. My beloved charioteer then, afflicted by that arrowy<br>shower, swerved from his place in the car, filling me with grief on his<br>account. A total unconsciousness then came over him. And thus wounded by<br>that arrowy downpour he fell down upon the earth in a swoon. And<br>afflicted as he had been by Rama's shafts, he soon gave up his life.<br>Then, O great king, fear entered my heart. And when, on the death of my<br>charioteer, I was still lamenting for him with heart unhinged by sorrow,<br>Rama began to shoot at me many death-dealing shafts. Indeed, even when<br>endangered at the death of my charioteer I was lamenting for him, he of<br>Bhrigu's race, drawing the bow with strength, pierced me deep with an<br>arrow! O king, that blood-drinking shaft, falling upon my breast, pierced<br>me through and fell simultaneously with my person upon the earth! Then, O<br>bull of Bharata's race, thinking I was dead, Rama repeatedly roared aloud<br>like the clouds and rejoiced exceedingly! indeed, O king, when thus I<br>fell down on the earth, Rama, filled with joy, sent forth loud shouts<br>along with his followers, while all the Kauravas who stood beside me and<br>all those who came there to witness the combat were afflicted with great<br>woe on seeing me fall. While lying prostrate, O lion among kings, I<br>beheld eight Brahmanas endued with the effulgence of the sun or the fire.<br>They stood surrounding me on that field of battle and supporting me on<br>their arms. Indeed, borne up by those Brahmanas I had not to touch the<br>ground. Like friends they supported me in mid-air while I was breathing<br>heavily. And they were sprinkling me with drops of water. And bearing me<br>up as they stood, they then, O king, repeatedly said unto me, 'Do not<br>fear! Let prosperity be thine!' Comforted then by those words of theirs,<br>I quickly rose up. I then beheld my mother Ganga&#8212;that foremost of the<br>rivers, stationed on my car. Indeed, O king of the Kurus, it was that<br>great river-goddess who had controlled my steeds in the combat (after my<br>charioteer's fall)! Worshipping then the feet of my mother and of the<br>spirits of my ancestors, I ascended my car. My mother then protected my<br>car, steeds, and all the implements of battle. With joined bands I<br>entreated her to go away. Having dismissed her, I myself restrained those<br>steeds endued with the speed of the wind, and fought with Jamadagni's<br>son, O Bharata, till the close of the day! Then, O chief of the Bharatas,<br>in course of that combat, I shot at Rama a powerful and heart-piercing<br>arrow endued with great speed. Afflicted with that shaft, Rama then, his<br>bow loosened from his grasp, fell down upon the earth on his knees, reft<br>of consciousness! And when Rama, that giver of many thousands (of golden<br>coins) fell, masses of clouds covered the firmament, pouring a copious<br>shower of blood! And meteors by hundreds fell, and thunder-rolls were<br>heard, causing everything to tremble! And suddenly Rahu enveloped the<br>blazing sun, and rough winds began to blow! And the earth itself began to<br>tremble. And vultures and crows and cranes began to alight in joy! And<br>the points of the horizon seemed to be ablaze and jackals began<br>repeatedly to yell fiercely! And drums, unstruck (by human hands), began<br>to produce harsh sound! Indeed, when the high-souled Rama embraced the<br>earth, reft of consciousness, all these frightful and alarming omens of<br>evil were seen! Then all on a sudden rising up, Rama approached me once<br>more, O Kaurava, for battle, forgetting everything and deprived of his<br>senses by anger. And that mighty-armed one took up his bow endued with<br>great strength and also a deadly arrow. I, however, resisted him<br>successfully. The great Rishis then (that stood there) were filled with<br>pity at the sight, while he, however, of Bhrigu's race, was filled with<br>great wrath. I then took up a shaft, resembling the blazing fire that<br>appears at the end of the Yuga, but Rama of immeasurable soul baffled<br>that weapon of mine. Then covered by clouds of dust, the splendour of the<br>solar disc was dimmed, and the sun went to the western mount. And night<br>came with its delicious and cool breezes, and then both of us desisted<br>from the fight. In this way, O king, when evening came the fierce battle<br>ceased, and (next day) with the re-appearance of the sun it commenced<br>again. And it lasted for three and twenty days together.'"
