                            "Kunti said, 'Hearing these words of his mother the son said, O ruthless<br>and wrathful mother, O thou that thinkest highly of martial heroism, thy<br>heart is surely made of steel beat into that shape. Fie on Kshatriya<br>practices, in accordance with which thou urgest me to battle, as if I<br>were a stranger to thee, and for the sake of which thou speakest to<br>me&#8212;thy only son&#8212;such words as if thou wert not my mother. If thou<br>beholdest me not, if thou art dissociated with me&#8212;thy son, of what use<br>then would the whole earth be to thee, of what use all thy ornaments and<br>all the means of enjoyment, indeed, of what use would life itself be to<br>thee?'<br><br>"The mother said, 'All the acts of those that are wise, are (undertaken),<br>O son, for the sake of virtue and profit. Eyeing these (virtue and<br>profit) only, I urge thee, O Sanjaya, to battle. The fit hour hath come<br>for exhibiting thy prowess. If at such a time thou dost not resort to<br>action, then disrespected by the people thou wouldst do that which would<br>be most disagreeable to me. If, O Sanjaya, thou art about to be stained<br>with infamy and I do not (from affection) tell thee anything, then that<br>affection, worthless and unreasonable, would be like that of the<br>she-ass's for her young. Do not tread the path that is disapproved by the<br>wise and adopted by the fool. Great is the ignorance here. Innumerable<br>creatures of the world have taken refuge in it. If thou, however,<br>adoptest the behaviour of the wise, thou wilt then be dear to me. Indeed,<br>if thou hast recourse to virtue and profit, if with God above thou<br>reliest upon human exertion, if thy conduct becometh like that of the<br>good, then it is by this and not by any other means that thou wilt become<br>dear to me. He that taketh delight in sons and grandsons that are<br>well-instructed (enjoyeth a delight that is real). He, on the other hand,<br>that taketh delight in a son who is destitute of exertion, refractory,<br>and wicked minded, hath not the very object accomplished for which a son<br>is desired. Those worst of men that never do what is proper and always do<br>what is censurable, do not obtain happiness here or hereafter. A<br>Kshatriya, O Sanjaya, hath been created for battle and victory. Whether<br>he winneth or perisheth, he obtaineth the region of Indra. The happiness<br>that a Kshatriya obtaineth by reducing his foes to subjection is such<br>that the like of it doth not exist in heaven in the sacred region of<br>Indra. Burning with wrath, a Kshatriya of great energy, if vanquished<br>many times, should wait desiring to vanquish his foes. Without either<br>casting away his own life or slaying his foes, how can he obtain peace of<br>mind by any other course? He that is possessed of wisdom regardeth<br>anything little as disagreeable. Unto that person to whom anything little<br>becomes agreeable, that little (ultimately) becometh a source of pain.<br>The man that hath not what is desirable soon becometh wretched. Indeed,<br>he soon feeleth every want and is lost like the Ganga on entering the<br>ocean.'<br><br>"The son said, 'Thou shouldst not, O mother, give expression to such<br>views before thy son. Show him kindness now, staying by his side, like a<br>silent and dumb being.'<br><br>"The mother said, 'Great is my gratification since thou sayest so. I who<br>may be urged (by thee to what is my duty) am thus urged by thee. I shall,<br>therefore, urge thee more (for doing what thou shouldst do). I will,<br>indeed, honour thee then when I will behold thee, crowned with complete<br>success after the slaughter of all the Saindhavas.'<br><br>"The son said, 'Without wealth, without allies, how can success and<br>victory be mine? Conscious of this exceedingly miserable state of mine, I<br>have myself abstained from desire of kingdom, like an evil-doer<br>abstaining from desire of heaven. If, therefore, O thou of mature wisdom,<br>thou seest any means (by which all this can be effected), speak fully of<br>it to me as I ask thee, for I shall do all that thou mayst command me to<br>do.'<br><br>"The mother said, 'Do not disgrace thy soul, O son, by anticipations of<br>failure. Objects unattained have been attained; while those attained have<br>been lost. The accomplishment of objects should never be sought with<br>wrath and folly. In all acts, O son, the attainment of success is always<br>uncertain. Knowing that success is uncertain, people still act, so that<br>they sometimes succeed, and sometimes do not. They, however, who abstain<br>from action, never obtain success. In the absence of exertion, there is<br>but one result, viz., the absence of success. There are, however, two<br>results in the case of exertion, viz., the acquisition of success or its<br>non-acquisition. He, O prince, who hath settled beforehand that all acts<br>are uncertain in respect of their results, maketh both success and<br>prosperity unattainable by himself. This will be,&#8212;with such a belief<br>should one, casting off all sloth, exert and wake up and address himself<br>to every act. That wise king, who, O son, engageth in acts, having<br>performed all auspicious rites and with the gods and the Brahmanas on his<br>side, soon winneth success. Like the sun embracing the east, the goddess<br>of prosperity embraceth him. I see thou hast shown thyself fit for the<br>various suggestions and means and encouraging speeches thou hast had from<br>me. Display (now) thy prowess. It behoveth thee to win, by every<br>exertion, the object thou hast in view. Bring together to thy own side<br>those that are angry (with thy foes), those that are covetous, those that<br>have been weakened (by thy foes), those that are jealous (of thy foes),<br>those that have been humiliated (by them), those that always challenge<br>(them) from excess of pride, and all others of this class. By this means<br>thou wilt be able to break the mighty host (of thy enemy) like an<br>impetuous and fierce-rising tempest scattering the clouds. Give them (thy<br>would be allies) wealth before it is due, seek their food, be up and<br>doing, and speak sweetly unto them all. They will then do the good, and<br>place thee at their head. When the enemy cometh to know that his foe hath<br>become reckless of his life, then is he troubled on the latter's account,<br>from a snake living in his chamber? If, knowing one to be powerful, one's<br>enemy doth not strive to subjugate him, he should at least make one<br>friendly by the application of the arts of conciliation, gift, and the<br>like. Even that would be tantamount to subjugation. Obtaining a respite<br>by means of the art of conciliation, one's wealth may increase. And if<br>one's wealth increaseth, one is worshipped and sought as a refuge by<br>one's friends. If, again, one is deprived of wealth, one is abandoned by<br>friends and relatives, and more than that mistrusted and even despised by<br>them. It is perfectly impossible for him to ever regain his kingdom, who,<br>having united himself with his foe, liveth confidently.'"
