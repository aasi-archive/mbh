                            "Arjuna said, 'O Janardana, Yudhishthira hath already said what should be<br>said. But, O chastiser of foes, hearing what thou hast said, it seemeth<br>to me that thou, O lord, does not think peace to be easily obtainable<br>either in consequence of Dhritarashtra's covetousness or from our present<br>weakness. Thou thinkest also that human prowess alone is fruitless, and<br>also that without putting forth one's prowess one's purposes cannot be<br>achieved. What thou hast said may be true, but at the same time it may<br>not always be true. Nothing, however, should be regarded as<br>impracticable. It is true, peace seemeth to thee to be impossible in<br>consequence of our distressful condition, yet they are still acting<br>against us without reaping the fruits of their acts. Peace, therefore, if<br>properly proposed, O lord, may be concluded. O Krishna, strive thou,<br>therefore, to bring about peace with the foe. Thou, O hero, art the<br>foremost of all friends of both the Pandavas and the Kurus, even as<br>Prajapati is of both the gods and the Asuras. Accomplish thou, therefore,<br>that which is for the good of both the Kurus and the Pandavas. The<br>accomplishment of our good is not, I believe, difficult for thee. If thou<br>strivest, O Janardana, such is this act that it will be soon effected. As<br>soon as thou goest thither, it will be accomplished. If, O hero, thou<br>purposest to treat the evil-minded Duryodhana in any other way, that<br>purpose of thine will be carried out exactly as thou wishest. Whether it<br>be peace or war with the foe that thou wishest, any wish, O Krishna, that<br>thon mayest entertain, will certainly be honoured by us. Doth not the<br>evil-minded Duryodhana with his sons and kinsmen deserve destruction<br>when, unable to bear the sight of Yudhishthira's prosperity and finding<br>no other faultless expedient, that wretch, O slayer of Madhu, deprived us<br>of our kingdom by the sinful expedient of deceitful dice? What bowman is<br>there, who, born in the Kshatriya order, and invited to combat, turneth<br>away from the fight even if he is sure to die? Beholding ourselves<br>vanquished by sinful means and banished to the woods, even then, thou of<br>the Vrishni race, I thought that Suyodhana deserved death at my hands.<br>What thou, however, O Krishna, wishest to do for thy friends is scarcely<br>strange, although it seems inexplicable how the object In view is capable<br>of being effected by either mildness or its reverse. Or, if thou deemest<br>their immediate destruction to be preferable, let it be effected soon<br>without further deliberation. Surely, thou knowest how Draupadi was<br>insulted in the midst of the assembly by Duryodhana of sinful soul and<br>how also we bore it with patience. That Duryodhana, O Madhava, will<br>behave with justice towards the Pandavas is what I cannot believe. Wise<br>counsels will be lost on him like seed sown in a barren soil. Therefore,<br>do without delay what thou, O thou of Vrishni race, thinkest to be proper<br>and beneficial for the Pandavas, or what, indeed, should next be done.'"
