                            "The holy one said, 'I have heard Sanjaya's words and now I have heard<br>thine. I know all about his purposes as also of thyself. Thy heart<br>inclineth to righteousness, whereas their inclination is towards enmity.<br>That which is obtained without war is of great value to thee. A long-life<br>Brahmacharya is not, O lord of earth, the duty of a Kshatriya. Indeed,<br>men of all the four orders have said that a Kshatriya should never<br>subsist on alms; victory or death in battle, hath been eternally ordained<br>by the Creator; even that is the duty of a Kshatriya. Cowardice is not<br>applauded (in a Kshatriya). Subsistence, O Yudhishthira, is not possible<br>by Cowardice, O thou of mighty arms. Display thy prowess, and vanquish, O<br>chastiser of foes, thy enemies. The covetous son of Dhritarashtra, O<br>chastiser of foes, living for a long time (with many kings) has by<br>affection and friendship become very powerful. Therefore, O king, there<br>is no hope of making his peace with thee. They regard themselves strong,<br>having Bhishma and Drona and Kripa and others with them. As long, O king,<br>as thou, O grinder of foes, wilt behave with them mildly, they will<br>withhold thy kingdom. Neither from compassion, nor from mildness, nor<br>from a sense of righteousness, will the sons of Dhritarashtra, O<br>chastiser of foes, fulfil thy wishes. This, O son of Pandu, is another<br>proof that they will not make peace with thee. Having pained thee so<br>deeply by making thee put on a Kaupina, they were not stung with remorse.<br>In the very sight of the Grandsire (Bhishma) and Drona and the wise<br>Vidura, of many holy Brahmanas, the king, the citizens, and all the chief<br>Kauravas, the cruel Duryodhana, deceitfully defeating thee at dice,&#8212;thee<br>that are charitable, gentle, self-restrained, virtuous, and of rigid vows<br>was not, O king, ashamed of his vile act. Do not, O monarch, show any<br>compassion for that wretch of such disposition. They deserve death at the<br>hands of all, how much more then of thee, O Bharata? O Bharata, with what<br>improper speeches did Duryodhana with his brothers, filled with gladness<br>and indulging in many a boast, afflict thee with thy brothers! He said,<br>'The Pandavas now have nothing of their own in this wide earth. Their<br>very names and lineage are extinct. In time, which is never-ending,<br>defeat will be theirs. All their virtues having merged in me, they will<br>now be reduced to the five elements.' While the match at dice was in<br>progress, the wretched Dussasana of most wicked soul, seizing that<br>weeping lady by the hair dragged princess Draupadi, as if she had no<br>protectors, to the assembly of kings, and in the presence of Bhishma and<br>Drona and others, repeatedly called her&#8212;cow, cow! Restrained by thee,<br>thy brothers of terrible prowess, bound also by the bonds of virtue, did<br>nothing to avenge it; and after thou hadst been exiled to the woods,<br>Duryodhana having uttered such and other cruel words, boasted amid his<br>kinsmen. Knowing thee innocent, they that were assembled sat silent in<br>the assembly-house, weeping with choked voice. The assembled kings with<br>the Brahmanas did not applaud him for this. Indeed, all the courtiers<br>present there censured him. To a man of noble descent, O grinder of foes,<br>even censure is death. Death is even many times better than a life of<br>blame. Even then, O king, he died when, upon being censured by all the<br>kings of the earth, he felt no shame! He whose character is so abominable<br>may easily be destroyed even like a rootless tree standing erect on a<br>single weak root. The sinful and evil-minded Duryodhana deserveth death<br>at the hands of every one, even like a serpent. Slay him, therefore, O<br>killer of foes, and hesitate not in the least. It behoveth thee, O<br>sinless one, and I like it too, that thou shouldst pay homage unto thy<br>father Dhritarashtra and also unto Bhishma. Going thither I will remove<br>the doubts of all men who are still undecided as to the wickedness of<br>Duryodhana. Thither in the presence of all kings I will enumerate all<br>those virtues of thine that are not to be met in all men, as also all the<br>vices of Duryodhana. And hearing me speak beneficial words, pregnant with<br>virtue and profit, the rulers of various realms will regard thee as<br>possessed of a virtuous soul, and as a speaker of truth, while at the<br>same time, they will understand how Duryodhana is actuated by avarice. I<br>will also tell the vice of Duryodhana, before both the citizens and the<br>inhabitants of the country, before both the young and the old, of all the<br>four orders that will be collected there. And as thou askest for peace no<br>one will charge thee sinful, while all the chiefs of the earth will<br>censure the Kurus and Dhritarashtra; and when Duryodhana will be dead in<br>consequence of his being forsaken by all men, there will be nothing left<br>to do. Do then what should now be done. Going unto the Kurus, I shall<br>strive to make peace without sacrificing thy interests, and marking their<br>inclination for war and all their proceedings, I will soon come back, O<br>Bharata, for thy victory. I think war with the enemy to be certain. All<br>the omens that are noticeable by me point to that. Birds and animals set<br>up frightful screeches and howls at the approach of dusk. The foremost of<br>elephants and steeds assume horrible shapes; the very fire exhibiteth<br>diverse kinds of terrible hues! This would never have been the case but<br>for the fact of the world-destroying Havoc's self coming into our midst!<br>Making ready their weapons, machines, coats of mail, and cars, elephants,<br>and steeds, let all thy warriors be prepared for battle, and let them<br>take care of their elephants and horses and cars. And, O king, collect<br>everything that thou needest for the impending war. As long as he liveth,<br>Duryodhana will, by no means, be able to give back unto thee. O king,<br>that kingdom of thine which, abounding in prosperity, have before been<br>taken by him at dice!'"
