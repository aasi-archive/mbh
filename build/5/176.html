                            "Bhishma said, 'I then placed the matter before (my mother) Kali,<br>otherwise called Gandhavati, as also all our counsellors, and also before<br>our special and ordinary priests and then permitted, O king, the eldest<br>of those maidens, Amva, to depart. Permitted by me, that maiden then went<br>to the city of the ruler of the Salwas. And she had for her escort a<br>number of old Brahmanas and was also accompanied by her own nurse. And<br>having travelled the whole distance (between Hastinapura and Salwa's<br>city), she approached king Salwa and said these words, 'I come, O thou of<br>mighty arms, expectant of thee, O high-souled one! Unto her, however, O<br>king, the lord of the Salwas said with a laughter, 'O thou of the fairest<br>complexion, I no longer desire to make a wife of thee who wast to be<br>wedded to another. Therefore, O blessed one, go back thither unto<br>Bhishma's presence. I no longer desire thee that was forcibly ravished by<br>Bhishma. Indeed, when Bhishma, having vanquished the kings, took thee<br>away, thou didst go with him cheerfully. When having humiliated and<br>vanquished all the kings of the earth, Bhishma took thee away, I no<br>longer desire thee, O thou of the fairest complexion, for a wife,&#8212;thee<br>that was to have been wedded to another! How can a king like myself, who<br>is acquainted with all branches of knowledge and who lays down laws for<br>the guidance of others, admit (into his abode) a woman who was to have<br>been wedded to another? O blessed lady, go whithersoever thou wishest,<br>without spending thy time in vain!' Hearing these words of his, Amva<br>then, O king, afflicted with the arrows of the god of love, addressed<br>Salwa, saying, 'Say not so, O lord of the earth, for it is not so! O<br>grinder of foes, cheerful I was not when taken away by Bhishma! He took<br>me away by force, having routed all the kings, and I was weeping all the<br>while. An innocent girl that I am and attached to thee, accept me, O lord<br>of the Salwas! The abandonment (by one) of those that are attached (to<br>him) is never applauded in the scriptures. Having solicited Ganga's son<br>who never retreats from battle, and having at last obtained his<br>permission, I come to thee! Indeed, the mighty-armed Bhishma, O king,<br>desireth me not! It hath been heard by me that his action (in this<br>matter) hath been for the sake of his brother. My two sisters Amvika and<br>Amvalika, who were abducted with me at the same time, have, O king, been<br>bestowed by Ganga's son on his younger brother Vichitravirya! O lord of<br>the Salwas, I swear, O tiger among men, by touching my own head that I<br>have never thought of any other husband than thee! I do not, O great<br>king, come to thee as one who was to have been wedded to another! I tell<br>thee the truth, O Salwa, truly swearing by my soul! Take me, O thou of<br>large eyes, me&#8212;a maiden come to thee of her own accord&#8212;one unbetrothed<br>to another, one desirous of thy grace!' Although she spoke in this<br>strain, Salwa, however, O chief of the Bharatas, rejected that daughter<br>of the ruler of Kasi, like a snake casting off his slough. Indeed,<br>although that king was earnestly solicited with diverse expressions such<br>as these, the lord of the Salwas still did not, O bull of the Bharata<br>race, manifest any inclination for accepting the girl. Then the eldest<br>daughter of the ruler of Kasi, filled with anger, and her eyes bathed in<br>tears, said these words with a voice choked with tears and grief, 'Cast<br>off, O king, by thee, whithersoever I may go, the righteous will be my<br>protectors, for truth is indestructible!'<br><br>"It thus, O thou of Kuru's race, that the lord of the Salwas rejected<br>that maiden who addressed him in language such as this and who was<br>sobbing in grief so tenderly. Go, go,&#8212;were the words that Salwa said<br>unto her repeatedly. I am in terror of Bhishma, O thou of fair hips, thou<br>art Bhishma's capture! Thus addressed by Salwa destitute of foresight,<br>that maiden issued out of his city sorrowfully and wailing like a<br>she-osprey.'"
