                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing these words (of the leaders of the Kuru<br>army), Kunti's son Yudhishthira, summoning all his brothers, said unto<br>them these words in private.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'The spies I had placed in the army of<br>Dhritarashtra's son, brought me this news in the morning. Duryodhana.<br>asked Ganga's son of great vows, saying, 'O lord, in what time cant thou<br>annihilate the troops of Pandu's sons?' Indeed, the wicked Duryodhana was<br>answered by him in these words, viz.,&#8212;In a month! Drona also declared<br>that he could do the same feat in about the same time. Gautama (Kripa)<br>indicated twice that period, as hath been heard by us. Drona's son<br>acquainted with weapons of high efficacy declared the period (in his<br>case) to be ten nights. Karna also, acquainted with weapons of high<br>efficacy, asked in the midst of the Kurus, declared that the could<br>complete the slaughter in five days. Therefore, I also, O Arjuna, am<br>desirous of hearing thy words, 'In what time canst thou, O Falguni,<br>exterminate the foe?' Thus addressed by the king, Dhananjaya of curly<br>hair, casting a look upon Vasudeva, said these words, 'All these (Bhishma<br>and others) are high-souled (warriors), accomplished in arms and<br>acquainted with all modes of warfare. Without doubt, O king, they can<br>exterminate (our forces) even thus! Let thy heart's anguish, however, be<br>dispelled. I tell thee truly that with Vasudeva as my ally, I can, on a<br>single car, exterminate the three worlds with even the immortals, indeed,<br>all mobile creatures that were, are, will be, in the twinkling of the<br>eye. This is what I think. That terrible and mighty weapon which the Lord<br>of all creatures (Mahadeva) gave me on the occasion of my hand-to-hand<br>encounter with him (in the guise of) a hunter, still existeth with me.<br>Indeed, O tiger among men, that weapon which the Lord of all creatures<br>useth at the end of Yuga for destroying created things, existeth with me.<br>Ganga's son knoweth not that weapon; nor Drona nor Gautama (Kripa); nor<br>Drona's son, O king! How, therefore, can the Suta's son know it. It is<br>not, however, proper to slay ordinary men in battle by means of celestial<br>weapons. We shall (on the other band) vanquish our foes in a fair fight.<br>Then, these tigers among men, O king, are thy allies! All of them are<br>well-versed in celestial weapons, and all of them are eager for battle.<br>All of them after their initiation in the Vedas, have undergone the final<br>bath in sacrifices. All of them are unvanquished. They are competent, O<br>son of Pandu, to slay in battle the army of even the celestials. Thou<br>hast for thy allies Sikhandin, and Yuyudhana and Dhristadyumna of<br>Prishata's race; and Bhimasena, and these twins, and Yudhamanyu, and<br>Uttamaujas, and Virata and Drupada who are equal in battle unto Bhishma<br>and Drona; and the mighty-armed Sankha, and Hidimva's son of great might;<br>and this latter's son Anjanparvan endued with great strength and prowess;<br>and Sini's descendant of mighty arms and well-versed in battle, and the<br>mighty Abhimanyu and the five sons of Draupadi! Thou art thyself, again,<br>competent to exterminate the three worlds! O thou that art endued with<br>effulgence equal unto that of Sakra himself, I know it, O Kaurava, for it<br>is manifest, that that man upon whom thou mayest cast thy eyes in anger<br>is sure to be annihilated!'"
