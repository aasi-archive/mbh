                            "Vaisampayana said, 'After that night had passed away, king Duryodhana, O<br>Bharata, distributed (in proper order) his eleven Akshauhinis of troops.<br>And arranging his men, elephants, cars, and steeds, into three classes,<br>viz., superior, middling, and inferior, the king distributed them amongst<br>his divisions (by placing them in the van, centre, and rear of the<br>ranks). And furnished with timber and planks for repairing the damages<br>their cars might sustain in the press of battle, with large quivers borne<br>on cars, with tiger-skins and other stiff leather for enveloping the<br>sides of cars, with barbed javelins to be hurled by the hand, with<br>quivers borne on the backs of steeds and elephants, with long-handled<br>spears of iron and missiles, with quivers borne on the backs of<br>foot-soldiers with heavy clubs of woods, with flagstaffs and banners,<br>with long heavy shafts shot from bows, with diverse kinds of nooses and<br>lassoes, with armour of various kinds, with short-pointed clubs of wood,<br>with oil, treacle, and sand, with earthen pots filled with poisonous<br>snakes, with pulverised lac and other inflammable matter, with short<br>spears furnished with tinkling bells, with diverse weapons of iron, and<br>machines, for hurling hot treacle, water, and stones, with whistling<br>clubs of hard wood, with wax and heavy mallets, with clubs of wood having<br>iron spikes, with plough-poles and poisoned darts, with long syringes for<br>pouring warm treacle and planks of cane, with battle-axes and forked<br>lances with spiked gauntlets, with axes and pointed iron-spikes, with<br>cars having their sides covered with skins of tigers, and leopards, with<br>sharp-edged circular planks of wood, with horns, with javelins and<br>various other weapons of attack, with axes of the kuthara species, and<br>spades, with cloths steeped in oil, and with clarified butter, the<br>divisions of Duryodhana, glittering with robes embroidered with gold and<br>decked with various kinds of jewels and gems and consisting of warriors<br>endued with handsome persons, blazed forth like fire. And cased in coats<br>of mail and well-skilled in weapons, accomplished in horse-lore, brave<br>persons of good birth were employed as car-drivers. And all the cars were<br>furnished with various drugs, and with horses having rows of bells and<br>pearls on their heads, and with banners and flagstaffs, and with<br>ornaments gracing their steeples and turrets and with shields, swords,<br>and lances, and javelins and spiked maces. And unto each of those cars<br>were yoked four steeds of the best breed. And upon each of them were kept<br>a hundred bows. And each car had one driver in charge of the couple of<br>steeds in front, and two drivers in charge of the couple of steeds<br>attached to the wheels on the two sides. And both of the last-mentioned<br>drivers were skilled car-warriors, while the car-warrior himself was also<br>skilled in driving steeds. And thousands of cars thus furnished and<br>decked with gold, and protected like fortified town and incapable of<br>being conquered by foes, were stationed on all sides. And the elephants<br>also were furnished with rows of bells and pearls and decked with diverse<br>ornaments. And on the back of each of those animals, mounted seven<br>warriors. And in consequence of such accoutrements those animals looked<br>like hills graced with jewels. And amongst the seven, two were armed with<br>hooks, two were excellent bowmen, two were first-rate swords-men, and<br>one, O king, was armed with a lance and trident. And, O king, the army of<br>the illustrious Kuru king, teemed with innumerable infuriate elephants,<br>bearing on their backs loads of weapons and quivers filled with arrows.<br>And there were also thousands of steeds ridden by brave soldiers<br>accoutred in mail, decked in ornaments, and furnished with flags. And<br>numbering in hundreds and thousands, all those steeds were free from the<br>habit of scratching the ground with their forehoofs. And they were all<br>well-trained, and decked with ornaments of gold, and exceedingly obedient<br>to their riders. And of foot-soldiers, there were hundreds of thousands<br>of diverse mien, accoutred in armours of diverse kinds and armed also<br>with weapons of diverse species, and decked with golden ornaments. And<br>unto each car, were assigned ten elephants, and unto each elephant ten<br>horses, and unto each horse ten foot-soldiers, as protectors. Again, a<br>large body of troops was kept as a reserve for rallying the ranks that<br>would be broken. And this reserve consisted of cars, unto each of which<br>were attached fifty elephants; and unto each elephant were attached a<br>hundred horses; and unto each horse were attached seven foot-soldiers.<br>Five hundred cars, as many elephants (fifteen hundred horses, and two<br>thousand five hundred foot-soldiers) constitute a Sena. Ten Senas<br>constitute a Pritana; and ten Pritanas, a Vahini. In common parlance,<br>however, the words Sena, Vahini, Pritana, Dhwajini, Chamu, Akshauhini,<br>and Varuthini are used in the same sense.<br><br>'It was thus that the intelligent Kaurava arrayed his force. Between the<br>two sides, the total number was eighteen Akshauhinis. Of this, the<br>Pandava force consisted of seven Akshauhinis, while the Kaurava force<br>consisted of ten Akshauhinis and one more. Five times fifty men<br>constitute a Patti. Three Pattis make a Senamukha or Gulma. Three Gulmas<br>make a Gana. In Duryodhana's army, there were thousands and hundred of<br>such Ganas consisting of warriors capable of smiting (the foe) and<br>longing for battle. And the mighty-armed king Duryodhana, selecting from<br>among them brave and intelligent warriors, made them the leaders of his<br>troops. And placing an Akshauhini of troops under each of those best of<br>men, viz., Kripa, Drona, Salya, Jayadratha, the king of the Sindhus,<br>Sudakshina the ruler of the Kamvojas, Kritavarman, Drona's son<br>(Aswatthaman), Karna, Bhurisravas, Sakuni, the son of Suvala, and the<br>mighty Vahlika, the king used to bring them daily before him and at all<br>hours, and speak to them. And he repeatedly offered them worship before<br>his very eyes. And thus appointed, all warriors, with all their<br>followers, became desirous of doing what was most agreeable to the king.'"
