                            "Bhishma said, 'All the five sons of Draupadi, O monarch, are Maharathas.<br>Virata's son Uttara is, in my judgment, one of the foremost of Rathas.<br>The mighty-armed Abhimanyu is a leader of leaders of car-divisions.<br>Indeed, that slayer of foes is equal in battle to Partha himself or<br>Vasudeva. Endued with great lightness of hand in shooting weapons, and<br>acquainted with all the modes of warfare, he is possessed of great energy<br>and is steady in the observance of vows. Remembering the sufferings of<br>his own father, he will put forth his prowess. The brave Satyaki of<br>Madhu's race is a leader of leaders of car-divisions. Foremost among the<br>heroes of the Vrishni race, he is endued with great wrath, and is<br>perfectly dauntless. Uttamaujas also, O king, is an excellent car-warrior<br>in my judgment. And Yudhamanyu, too, of great prowess, is, in my<br>judgment, an excellent car-warrior. All those chiefs own many thousands<br>of cars and elephants and horses, and they will fight, reckless of their<br>very lives, from desire of doing what is agreeable to Kunti's sons.<br>Uniting with the Pandavas, they will, O great king, sweep through thy<br>ranks like fire or the wind, challenging thy warriors. Invincible in<br>battle, those bulls among men, old Virata and old Drupada, both endued<br>with great prowess, are, in my judgment, both Maharathas. Though old in<br>years yet both of them are devoted to the observance of Kshatriya<br>virtues. Treading along the path that is trod by heroes, both of them<br>will exert to the best of their might. In consequence of their<br>relationship (to the Pandavas) and owing also, O king, to their being<br>endued with strength and prowess, those great bowmen devoted to pure<br>vows, have both derived additional strength from the strength of their<br>affection. According as the cause is, all strong-armed men become, O bull<br>of Kuru's race, heroes or cowards. Actuated by a singleness of purpose,<br>both these kings, who are powerful bowmen, will lay down their very lives<br>in causing a great massacre of thy troops to the best of their might, O<br>slayer of foes! Fierce in battle, these distinguished heroes, these<br>mighty bowmen, regardless, O Bharata, of their lives, will, at the head<br>of their respective Akshauhinis, achieve great feats, justifying their<br>relationship and the confidence that is reposed on them (by the<br>Pandavas).'"
