                            "Dhritarashtra said, Yudhishthira the son of Pandu is endued with<br>Kshatriya energy and leadeth the Brahmacharya mode of life from his very<br>youth. Alas, with him these foolish sons of mine desire to fight,<br>disregarding me that am thus bewailing. I ask thee, O Duryodhana, O<br>foremost of the Bharata race, desist from hostility. O chastiser of foes,<br>under any circumstances, war is never applauded. Half the earth is quite<br>enough for the maintenance of thyself and all thy followers. Give back<br>unto the sons of Pandu, O chastiser of foes, their proper share. All the<br>Kauravas deem just this to be consistent with justice, that thou shouldst<br>make peace with the high-souled sons of Pandu. Reflect thus, O son, and<br>thou wilt find that this thy army is for thy own death. Thou<br>understandest not this from thy own folly. I myself do not desire war,<br>nor Vahlika, nor Bhishma, nor Drona, nor Aswatthaman, nor Sanjaya, nor<br>Somadatta, nor Salya, nor Kripa, nor Satyavrata, nor Purumitra, nor<br>Bhurisravas,&#8212;in fact, none of these desireth war. Indeed, those warriors<br>upon whom the Kauravas, when afflicted by the foe, will have to rely, do<br>not approve of the war. O child, let that be acceptable to thee. Alas,<br>thou dost not seek it of thy own will, but it is Karna and the<br>evil-minded Dussasana and Sakuni, the son of Suvala, that are leading<br>thee to it.'<br><br>"Duryodhana said, 'I challenge the Pandavas to battle, without depending<br>upon thyself, Drona, or Aswatthaman, or Sanjaya, or Vikarna, or Kamvoja,<br>or Kripa, or Vahlika, or Satyavrata, or Purumitra, or Bhurisravas, or<br>others of thy party. But, O bull among men, only myself and Karna, O<br>sire, are prepared to celebrate the sacrifice of battle with all the<br>necessary rites, making Yudhishthira the victim. In that sacrifice, my<br>car will be the altar; my sword will be the smaller ladle, my mace, the<br>large one, for pouring libations; my coat of mail will be assembly of<br>spectators; my four steeds will be the officiating priests; my arrows<br>will be the blades of Kusa grass; and fame will be the clarified butter.<br>O king, performing, in honour of Yama, such a sacrifice in battle, the<br>ingredients of which will all be furnished by ourselves, we will return<br>victoriously covered with glory, after having slain our foes. Three of<br>us, O sire, viz., myself and Karna and my brother Dussasana,&#8212;will slay<br>the Pandavas in battle. Either I, slaying the Pandavas, will sway this<br>Earth, or the sons of Pandu, having slain me, will enjoy this Earth. O<br>king, O thou of unfading glory, I would sacrifice my life, kingdom,<br>wealth, everything, but would not be able to live side by side with the<br>Pandavas. O venerable one, I will not surrender to the Pandavas even that<br>much of land which may be covered by the sharp point of a needle.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'I now abandon Duryodhana for ever. 'A nevertheless<br>grieve for you all, ye kings, that will follow this fool who is about to<br>proceed to Yama's abode. Like tigers among a herd of deer, those foremost<br>of smiters-the sons of Pandu,&#8212;will smite down your principal leaders<br>assembled for battle. Methinks, the Bharata host, like a helpless woman,<br>will be afflicted and crushed and hurled to a distance by Yuyudhana of<br>long arms. Adding to the strength of Yudhishthira's army, which without<br>him was already sufficient, Sini's son will take up his stand on the<br>field of battle and scatter his arrows like seeds on a cultivated field.<br>And Bhimasena will take up his position in the very van of the<br>combatants, and all his soldiers will fearlessly stand in his rear, as<br>behind a rampart. Indeed, when thou, O Duryodhana, wilt behold elephants,<br>huge as hills, prostrated on the ground with their tusks disabled, their<br>temples crushed and bodies dyed with gore,&#8212;in fact, when thou wilt see<br>them lying on the field of battle like riven hills, then, afraid of a<br>clash with him, thou wilt remember these my words. Beholding thy host<br>consisting of cars, steeds, and elephants, consumed by Bhimasena, and<br>presenting the spectacle of a wide-spread conflagration's track, thou<br>wilt remember these my words. If ye do not make peace with the Pandavas,<br>overwhelming calamity will be yours. Slain by Bhimasena with his mace, ye<br>will rest in peace. Indeed, when thou wilt see the Kuru host levelled to<br>the ground by Bhima, like a large forest torn up by the roots, then wilt<br>thou remember these my words.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said this unto all those rulers of the<br>earth, the king addressing Sanjaya again, asked him as follows.'"
