                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Having addressed Suyodhana thus, the highly blessed<br>and wise Dhritarashtra again asked Sanjaya, saying, 'Tell me, O Sanjaya,<br>what thou hast not yet said, viz., what Arjuna told thee after the<br>conclusion of Vasudeva's speech, for great is my curiosity to hear it.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Having heard the words spoken by Vasudeva, the<br>irresistible Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, when the opportunity came,<br>said these words in the hearing of Vasudeva. 'O Sanjaya, our grandsire,<br>the son of Santanu, and Dhritarashtra, and Drona, and Kripa, and Karna,<br>and king Vahlika, and Drona's son, and Somadatta, and Sakuni the son of<br>Suvala; and Dussasana, and Sala, and Purumitra, and Vivingsati; Vikarna,<br>and Chitrasena, and king Jayatsena, and Vinda and Anuvinda, the two<br>chiefs of Avanti, and Bhurisravas, and king Bhagadatta, and king<br>Jarasandha and other rulers of the earth, assembled there to fight for<br>the good of the Kauravas, are all on the eve of death. They have been<br>assembled by Dhritarashtra's son for being offered up as libations on the<br>blazing Pandava-fire. In my name, Sanjaya, enquire after the welfare of<br>those assembled kings according to their respective ranks, paying them<br>proper regard at the same time. Thou shouldest also, O Sanjaya, say this,<br>in the presence of all kings, unto Suyodhana-that foremost of all sinful<br>men. Wrathful and wicked, of sinful soul and exceedingly covetous, do<br>thou, O Sanjaya, see that that fool with his counsellors hears all that I<br>say.' And with this preface, Pritha's son Dhananjaya, endued with great<br>wisdom, and possessed of large eyes with red corners, glancing at<br>Vasudeva, then spoke unto me these words pregnant with both virtue and<br>profit, 'Thou hast already heard the measured words spoken by the<br>high-souled chief of the Madhu's race. Say unto the assembled kings that<br>those are also my words. And say this also for me, unto those kings,&#8212;Do<br>ye together try to act in such a way that libations may not have to be<br>poured into the arrowy fire of the great sacrifice of battle, in which<br>the rattle of car-wheels will sound as mantras, and the rank-routing bow<br>will act as the ladle. If, indeed, ye do not give up unto Yudhishthira,<br>that slayer of foes, his own share in the kingdom asked back by him, I<br>shall then, by means of my arrows, send all of you, with cavalry,<br>infantry, and elephants, into the inauspicious regions of departed<br>spirits.' Then bidding adieu unto Dhananjaya and Hari of four arms and<br>bowing unto them both, I have with great speed come hither to convey<br>those words of grave import to thee, O thou that art endued with<br>effulgence equal that of the very gods.'
