                            "The holy one said, 'That, indeed, which should be said by a person of<br>great wisdom: that, indeed, which should be said by one possessed of<br>great foresight; that indeed, which should be said by one like thee to a<br>friend like me; that indeed, which is deserving of thee, being consistent<br>with virtue and profit, and truth; that, O Vidura, hath been said by<br>thee, father and mother-like, unto me. That which thou hast told me is<br>certainly true, worthy of approbation and consistent with reason. Listen,<br>however, with attention, O Vidura, to the reason of my coming. Well<br>knowing the wickedness of Dhritarashtra's son and the hostility of the<br>Kshatriyas that have sided with him. I have still, O Vidura, come to the<br>Kurus. Great will be the merit earned by him who will liberate from the<br>meshes of death the whole earth, with her elephants, cars and steeds,<br>overwhelmed with a dreadful calamity. If a man striving to the best of<br>his abilities to perform a virtuous act meets with failure, I have not<br>the least doubt that the merit of that act becomes his, notwithstanding<br>such failure. This also is known to those that are conversant with<br>religion and scripture, that if a person having intended mentally to<br>commit a sinful act does not actually commit it, the demerit of that act<br>can never be his. I will sincerely endeavour, O Vidura, to bring about<br>peace between the Kurus and the Srinjayas who are about to be slaughtered<br>in battle. That terrible calamity (which hangs over them all) hath its<br>origin in the conduct of the Kurus, for it is directly due to the action<br>of Duryodhana and Karna, the other Kshatriyas only following the lead of<br>these two. The learned regard him to be a wretch who doth not by his<br>solicitation seek to save a friend who is about to sink in calamity.<br>Striving to the best of his might, even to the extent of seizing him by<br>the hair, one should seek to dissuade a friend from an improper act. In<br>that case, he that acteth so, instead of incurring blame, reapeth praise.<br>It behoveth Dhritarashtra's son, therefore, O Vidura, with his<br>counsellors, to accept my good and beneficial counsels that are<br>consistent with virtue and profit and competent to dispel the present<br>calamity. I will, therefore, sincerely endeavour to bring about the good<br>of Dhritarashtra's sons and of the Pandavas, as also of all the<br>Kshatriyas on the face of the earth. If while endeavouring to bring about<br>the good (of my friends), Duryodhana judgeth me wrongly, I shall have the<br>satisfaction of my own conscience, and a true friend is one who assumeth<br>the functions of an intercessor when dissensions break out between<br>kinsmen. In order, again, that unrighteous, foolish, and inimical persons<br>may not afterwards say that though competent, still Krishna did not make<br>any attempt to restrain the angry Kurus and the Pandavas from<br>slaughtering one another I have come here. Indeed, it is to serve both<br>parties that I have come hither. Having striven to bring about peace, I<br>will escape the censure of all the kings. If after listening to my<br>auspicious words, fraught with virtue and profit, the foolish Duryodhana<br>accept them not, he will only invite his fate. If without sacrificing the<br>interests of the Pandavas I can bring about peace among the Kurus, my<br>conduct will be regarded as highly meritorious, O high-souled one, and<br>the Kauravas themselves will be liberated from the meshes of death. If<br>the sons of Dhritarashtra reflect coolly on the words I shall<br>utter&#8212;words fraught with wisdom, consistent with righteousness, and<br>possessed of grave import,&#8212;then that peace which is my object will be<br>brought about and the Kauravas will also worship me (as the agent<br>thereof). If, on the other hand, they seek to injure me, I tell thee that<br>all the kings of the earth; united together, are no match for me, like a<br>herd of deer incapable of standing before an enraged lion.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said these words, that bull of the<br>Vrishni race and delighter of Yadavas, then laid himself down on his soft<br>bed for sleep.'"
