                            "Bhishma said, 'Then all those ascetics (that dwell in Vatsabhumi),<br>beholding the princess of Kasi firmly resolved on ascetic austerities,<br>dissuaded her and enquired of her, saying, 'What is thy business?' Thus<br>addressed, the maiden answered those ascetics, old in ascetic penances,<br>saying, 'Expelled I have been by Bhishma, prevented by him from the<br>virtue that would have been mine by living with a husband! My observance<br>of this vow is for his destruction and not for the sake of regions of<br>bliss, ye that are endued with wealth of asceticism! Having compassed the<br>death of Bhishma, peace will be mine. Even this is my resolve. He for<br>whom mine hath been this state of continuous grief, he for whom I have<br>been deprived of the region that would have been mine if I could obtain a<br>husband, he for whom I have become neither woman nor man, without slaying<br>in battle that son of Ganga I will not desist, ye that are endued with<br>wealth of asceticism. Even this that I have said is the purpose that is<br>in my heart. As a woman, I have no longer any desire. I am, however,<br>resolved to obtain manhood, for I will be revenged upon Bhishma. I should<br>not, therefore, be dissuaded by you.' Unto them she said these words<br>repeatedly. Soon, the divine lord of Uma, bearing the trident, showed<br>himself in his own form unto that female ascetic in the midst of those<br>great Rishis. Being asked to solicit the boon she wished, she begged of<br>the deity my defeat. Thou shalt slay him,&#8212;were the words the god said<br>unto that lady of great force of mind. Thus assured, the maiden, however,<br>once more said unto Rudra, 'How can it happen, O god, that being a woman<br>I shall yet be able to achieve victory in battle. O lord of Uma, as a<br>woman, my heart is quite stilled. Thou hast, however, promised me, O lord<br>of creatures, the defeat of Bhishma. O lord, having the bull for thy<br>mount, act in such a way that promise of thine may become true, that<br>encountering Bhishma, the son of Santanu, in battle I may be able to slay<br>him.' The god of gods, having the bull for his symbol, then said unto<br>that maiden, 'The words I have uttered cannot be false. O blessed lady,<br>true they will be. Thou shalt slay Bhishma, and even obtain manhood. Thou<br>shalt also remember all the incidents (of this life) even when thou shalt<br>obtain a new body. Born in the race of Drupada, thou shalt become a<br>Maharatha. Quick in the use of weapons and a fierce warrior, thou shalt<br>be well-skilled in battle. O blessed lady, all that I have said will be<br>true. Thou shalt become a man at the expiration of sometime (from thy<br>birth)!' Having said so, the god of gods, called also Kapardin, having<br>the bull for his symbol, disappeared then and there, in the very sight of<br>those Brahmanas. Upon this, that faultless maiden of the fairest<br>complexion, the eldest daughter of the king of Kasi, procuring wood from<br>that forest in the very sight of those great Rishis, made a large funeral<br>pyre on the banks of the Yamuna, and having set fire to it herself,<br>entered that blazing fire, O great king, with a heart burning with wrath,<br>and uttering, O king, the words,&#8212;(I do so) for Bhishma's destruction!'"
