                            "Drupada said, 'O mighty-armed one, it will, without doubt, be even as<br>thou hast said! Never will Duryodhana give up the kingdom by peaceful<br>means, and Dhritarashtra, who dotes on his son, will follow him in his<br>wish. And so will Bhishma and Drona from imbecility, and Karna and Sakuni<br>from folly. The words of Valadeva command themselves to my judgment; the<br>course pointed out by him should, indeed, be followed by a man who<br>desires peaceful settlement. But Duryodhana should never be addressed in<br>mild words. Vicious by nature, he, I believe cannot be brought to reason<br>by mildness. In respect of an ass, mildness is in place; but in respect<br>of animals of the bovine species, severity should be resorted to. If any<br>one were to speak mild words to Duryodhana, vicious by nature that wicked<br>wight would consider the speaker to be an imbecile person. If a mild<br>course is adopted towards him, the fool will think that he has won. Let<br>us do even this, let us make preparations; let us send word to our<br>friends that they may collect an army for us. Let speedy messengers go to<br>Salya, and Dhrishtaketu, and Jayatsena, and the prince of the Kekayas.<br>Duryodhana also, on his part, will send word to all the kings,<br>Rightminded persons, however, respond to the request of those that first<br>beseech them. Therefore, I ask you to make haste in first preferring your<br>suit to these rulers of men. Meseems that a great undertaking is awaiting<br>us. Quickly send word to Salya, and to the kings under him, and to king<br>Bhagadatta of immeasurable valour residing on the eastern sea-coast, and<br>to fierce Hardikya, and Ahuka, and the king of the Mallas of powerful<br>understanding, and Rochamana. Let Vrihanta be summoned and king<br>Senavindu, and Vahlika and Mudjakesa and the ruler of the Chedis, and<br>Suparsva, Suvahu; and that great hero, Paurava; and also the kings of the<br>Sakas, the Pahlavas, and the Daradas, and Surari, and Nadija, and king<br>Karnavest, and Nila, and the valiant king Viradharman; and Durjaya, and<br>Dantavakra, and Rukmi, and Janamejaya; and Ashada and Vayuvega, and king<br>Purvapali; and Bhuritejas, and Devaka, and Ekalaya with his sons; and<br>also the kings of the Krausha race, and the valiant Kshemamurti, and the<br>kings of the Kamboja and the Richika tribes, and of the western<br>sea-coast; and Jayatsena and the king of Kashi, and the rulers of the<br>land of the five rivers, and the proud son of Kratha, and the rulers of<br>the mountain regions, and Janaki, and Susarman and Maniman, and<br>Potimatsyaka, and the valiant Dhrishtaketu, and the ruler of the kingdom<br>of Pansu; and Paundra, and Dandadhara, and the brave Vrihatsena; and<br>Aparajita, and Nishada and Srenimat and Vasumat; and Vrihadvala of great<br>strength, and Vahu the conqueror of hostile cities; and the warlike king<br>Samudrasena with his son; and Uddhava, and Kshemaka and king Vatadhana;<br>and Srutayus, and Dridhayus, and the gallant son of Salwa; and the king<br>of the Kalingas, and Kumara, unconquerable in battle. Speedily send word<br>to these. This is what recommends itself to me. And let this my priest,<br>learned Brahmana, be sent, O king, to Dhritarashtra. Tell him the words<br>he is to say and what Duryodhana should be told; and how Bhishma is to be<br>addressed, and how Drona, that best of car-warriors!"
