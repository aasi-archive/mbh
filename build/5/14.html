                            "Salya said, 'Then the goddess of Divination stood near that chaste and<br>beautiful lady. And having beheld that goddess, youthful and lovely,<br>standing before her, Indra's queen, glad at heart, paid respects to them<br>and said, 'I desire to know who thou art, O thou of lovely face.' And<br>Divination said, 'I am Divination, O goddess, come near thee. Since thou<br>art truthful, therefore, O high-minded lady, do I appear in thy sight.<br>Since thou art devoted to thy lord, employed in controlling thyself, and<br>engaged in the practice of religious rites, I shall show thee the god<br>Indra, the slayer of Vritra. Quickly come after me, so may good betide<br>thee! Thou shalt see that best of gods.' Then Divination proceeded and<br>the divine queen of Indra went after her. And she crossed the heavenly<br>groves, and many mountains; and then having crossed the Himavat<br>mountains, she came to its northern side. And having reached the sea,<br>extending over many yojanas, she came upon a large island covered with<br>various trees and plants. And there she saw a beautiful lake, of heavenly<br>appearance, covered with birds, eight hundred miles in length, and as<br>many in breadth. And upon it, O descendant of Bharata, were full-blown<br>lotuses of heavenly appearance, of five colours, hummed round by bees,<br>and counting by thousands. And in the middle of that lake, there was a<br>large and beautiful assemblage of lotuses having in its midst a large<br>white lotus standing on a lofty stalk. And penetrating into the<br>lotus-stalk, along with Sachi, she saw Indra there who had entered into<br>its fibres. And seeing her lord lying there in a minute form, Sachi also<br>assumed a minute form, so did the goddess of divination too. And Indra's<br>queen began to glorify him by reciting his celebrated deeds of yore. And<br>thus glorified, the divine Purandara spoke to Sachi, 'For what purpose<br>hast thou come? How also have I been found out?' Then the goddess spoke<br>of the acts of Nahusha. And she said, 'O performer of a hundred<br>sacrifices, having obtained the sovereignty of the three worlds, powerful<br>and haughty and of a vicious soul, he hath commanded me to visit him, and<br>the cruel wretch hath even assigned me a definite time. If thou wilt not<br>protect me, O lord, he will bring me under his power. For this reason, O<br>Indra, have I come to thee in alarm. O thou of powerful arms, slay the<br>terrible Nahusha of vicious soul. Discover thyself, O slayer of Daityas<br>and Danavas. O lord, assume thy own strength and rule the celestial<br>kingdom.'"
