                            "Karna said, 'Without doubt, O Kesava, thou hast said these words from<br>thy love, affection, and friendship for me, as also in consequence of thy<br>desire of doing me good, O thou of Vrishni's race. I know all that thou<br>hast said unto me. Morally, I am the son of Pandu, as also in consequence<br>of the injunctions of the scriptures, as thou, O Krishna, thinkest. My<br>mother, while a maiden, bore me in her womb, O Janardana, through her<br>connection with Surya. And at the command of Surya himself, she abandoned<br>me as soon as I was born. Even thus, O Krishna, I came into the world.<br>Morally, therefore, I am the son of Pandu. Kunti, however, abandoned me<br>without thinking of my welfare. The Suta, Adhiratha, as soon as he beheld<br>me, took me to his home, and from her affection for me, Radha's breasts<br>were filled with milk that very day, and she, O Madhava, cleansed my<br>urine and evacuations. How can one like us, conversant with duties and<br>ever engaged in listening to scriptures deprive her of her Pinda? So also<br>Adhiratha of the Suta class regardeth me as a son, and I too, from<br>affection, always regard him as (my) father. O Madhava, that Adhiratha, O<br>Janardana, from paternal affection caused all the rites of infancy to be<br>performed on my person, according to the rules prescribed in the<br>scriptures. It is that Adhiratha, again, who caused the name Vasusena to<br>be bestowed upon me by the Brahmanas. When also I attained to youth, I<br>married wives according to his selections. Through them have been born my<br>sons and grandsons, O Janardana. My heart also, O Krishna, and all the<br>bonds of affection and love, are fixed on them. From joy or fear. O<br>Govinda. I cannot venture to destroy those bonds even for the sake of the<br>whole earth or heaps of gold. In consequence also of my connection with<br>Duryodhana of Dhritarashtra's race, I have, O Krishna, enjoyed<br>sovereignty for thirteen years, without a thorn on my side. I have<br>performed many sacrifices, always however in connection with persons of<br>the Suta tribe. All my family rites and marriage rites have been<br>performed with the Sutas. Obtaining me, O Krishna, Duryodhana hath, O<br>thou of Vrishni's race, made this preparations for an armed encounter and<br>provoked hostilities with the sons of Pandu. And it is for this, O<br>Achyuta, that in the battle (that will ensue), I, O Krishna, have been<br>chosen as the great antagonist of Arjuna to advance against him in a<br>single combat. For the sake of death, or the ties of blood, or fear, or<br>temptation, I cannot venture, O Janardana, to behave falsely towards the<br>intelligent son of Dhritarashtra. If I do not now engage in a single<br>combat with Arjuna, this will, O Hrishikesa, be inglorious for both<br>myself and Partha. Without doubt, O slayer of Madhu, thou hast told me<br>all this for doing me good. The Pandavas also, obedient as they are to<br>thee, will, without doubt, do all that thou hast said. Thou must,<br>however, conceal this our discourse for the present, O slayer of Madhu.<br>Therein lies our benefit, I think, O delighter of all the Yadavas. If<br>king Yudhishthira, of virtuous soul and well-controlled senses, cometh to<br>know me as the firstborn son of Kunti, he will never accept the kingdom.<br>If, again, O slayer of Madhu, this mighty and swelling empire becometh<br>mine. I shall, O repressor of foes, certainly make it over to Duryodhana<br>only. Let Yudhishthira of virtuous soul become king for ever. He that<br>hath Hrishikesa for his guide, and Dhananjaya and that mighty car-warrior<br>Bhima for his combatants, as also Nakula and Sahadeva, and the sons of<br>Draupadi, is fit, O Madhava, to rule over the whole earth.<br>Dhrishtadyumna, the prince of the Panchalas, that mighty car-warrior<br>Satyaki, Uttamaujas, Yudhamanyu, the prince of Somakas who is devoted to<br>truth, the ruler of the Chedis, Chekitana, the invincible Sikhandin, the<br>Kekaya brothers, all of the hue of Indragopaka insects, Bhimasena's uncle<br>Kuntibhoja of high soul and possessed of steeds endued with the colours<br>of the rainbow, the mighty car-warrior Syenajit, Sanka the son of Virata,<br>and thyself, O Janardana, like an ocean,&#8212;great is this assemblage, O<br>Krishna, of Kshatriyas (that hath been made by Yudhishthira). This<br>blazing kingdom, celebrated among all the kings of the earth, is already<br>won (by Yudhishthira). O thou of Vrishni's race, a great sacrifice of<br>arms is about to be celebrated by Dhritarashtra's son. Thou, O Janardana,<br>wilt be the Upadrashtri of that sacrifice. The office of Adhyaryu also, O<br>Krishna, in that sacrifice, will be thine. The ape-bannered Vibhatsu<br>accoutred in mail will be the Hotri (his bow), Gandiva will be the<br>sacrificial ladle, and the prowess of the warriors will be the clarified<br>butter (that is to be consumed). The weapons called Aindra, Pasupata,<br>Brahma, and Sthunakarna, applied by Arjuna, will, O Madhava, be the<br>mantras (of that sacrifice). Resembling his father, or perhaps, excelling<br>him in prowess, Subhadra's son (Abhimanyu) will be the chief Vedic hymn<br>to be chanted. That destroyer of elephant ranks that utterer of fierce<br>roars in battle, that tiger among men, the exceedingly mighty Bhima, will<br>be Udgatri and Prastotri in this sacrifice. King Yudhishthira of virtuous<br>Soul, ever engaged in Yapa and Homa, will himself be the Brahma of that<br>sacrifice. The sounds of conchs, tabors, and drums, and the leonine<br>roaring rising high in the welkin, will be the calls upon the invited to<br>eat. The two sons of Madri, Nakula and Sahadeva, of great fame and<br>prowess, will be the slayers of the sacrificial animals; rows of bright<br>cars furnished with standards of variegated hue, will, O Govinda, be<br>stakes (for tying the animals), O Janardana, in this sacrifice. Barbed<br>arrows and Nalikas, and long shafts, and arrows with heads like calf's<br>tooth, will play the part of spoons (wherewith to distribute the Soma<br>juice) while Tomaras will be the vessels of Soma, and bows will be<br>pavitras. The swords will be Kapalas, the heads (of slain warriors) the<br>Purodasas and the blood of warriors the clarified butter. O Krishna, in<br>this sacrifice. The lances and bright maces (of the warriors) will be<br>pokers (for stirring the sacrificial fire) and the corner stakes (for<br>keeping the fire-wood from falling down). The disciples of Drona and<br>Kripa, the son of Saradwat, will be the Sadasyas (assisting priests). The<br>arrows shot by the wielder of Gandiva and by (other) mighty car-warriors,<br>and by Drona and Drona's son, will play the part of ladles for<br>distributing the Soma. Satyaki will discharge the duties of the chief<br>assistant of the Adhyaryu. Of this sacrifice, Dhritarashtra's son will be<br>installed as the performer, while this vast army will be his wife. O thou<br>of mighty arms, when the nocturnal rites of sacrifice will begin, the<br>mighty Ghatotkacha will play the part of the slayer of (devoted) victims.<br>The mighty Dhrishtadyumna, who sprang into life from the sacrificial<br>fire, having for its mouth the rites celebrated with mantras, will, O<br>Krishna, be the Dakshina of that sacrifice. For those harsh words, O<br>Krishna, that I said before unto the sons of Pandu for the gratification<br>of Dhritarashtra's son,&#8212;for that wicked conduct of mine,&#8212;I am consumed<br>with repentance. When O Krishna, thou wilt behold me slain by Arjuna,<br>then will the Punachiti of this sacrifice commence. When the (second) son<br>of Pandu will drink the blood of the loudly roaring Dussasana, then will<br>the Soma-drinking of this sacrifice have taken place! When the two<br>princes of Panchala (Dhrishtadyumna and Sikhandin) will overthrow Drona<br>and Bhishma, then, O Janardana, will this sacrifice be suspended for an<br>interval. When mighty Bhimasena will slay Duryodhana, then, O Madhava,<br>will this sacrifice of Dhritarashtra's son be concluded. When the wives<br>of Dhritarashtra's sons and grandsons assembled together, deprived, O<br>Kesava, of their husbands and sons and without protectors, will indulge<br>in lamentations with Gandhari in their midst, on the field of battle<br>haunted by dogs and vultures and other carnivorous birds, then, O<br>Janardana, will the final bath of this sacrifice take place.<br><br>'I pray to thee, O bull of the Kshatriya race, let not the Kshatriyas,<br>old in learning and old in years, perish miserably, O Janardana, for thy<br>sake. Oh, let this swelling host of Kshatriyas perish by means of weapons<br>on that most sacred of all spots in the three worlds, viz. Kurukshetra, O<br>Kesava. O thou of eyes like lotus-leaves, accomplish on this spot what<br>thou hast in thy mind, so that, O thou of Vrishni's race, the whole<br>Kshatriya order may attain to heaven. As long, O Janardana, as the hills<br>and the rivers will last, so long will the fame of these achievements<br>last. The Brahmanas will recite this great war of the Bharatas. The fame,<br>O thou of Vrishni's race, that they achieve in battles is the wealth that<br>Kshatriyas own. O Kesava, bring Kunti's son (Arjuna) before me for<br>battle, keeping for ever this our discourse a secret, O chastiser of<br>foes.'"
