                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'O thou of great intelligence, tell me again words<br>such as these, consistent with religion and profit. My thirst for hearing<br>them is not quenched. What thou sayst is charming!"<br><br>"Vidura said, 'Ablution in all the holy places and kindness to all<br>creatures,&#8212;these two are equal. Perhaps, kindness to all creatures<br>surpasseth the former. O master, show kindness unto all thy sons, for by<br>that winning great fame in this world, thou wilt have heaven hereafter.<br>As long as a man's good deeds are spoken of in this world, so long, O<br>tiger among men, is he glorified in heaven. In this connection is cited<br>an old story about the conversation between Virochana and Sudhanwan, both<br>suitors for Kesini's hand. Once on a time, O king, there was a maiden of<br>the name of Kesini, unrivalled for beauty; moved by the desire of<br>obtaining a good husband, she resolved to choose her lord in Swayamvara.<br>Then one of the sons of Diti, Virochana by name, went to that spot,<br>desirous of obtaining the maiden. Beholding that chief of the Daityas,<br>Kesini addressed him, saying, 'Are Brahmanas superior, O Virochana, or<br>are the sons of Diti superior? And why also should not Sudhanwan sit on<br>the sofa?' Virochana said, 'Sprung from Prajapati himself, we, O Kesini,<br>are the best and at the top of all creatures, and this world is ours<br>without doubt. Who are the gods, and who are the Brahmanas?' Kesini said,<br>'We will, O Virochana, stay here in this very pavilion. Sudhanwan will<br>come here on the morrow, and let me see both of you sitting together.'<br>Virochana said, 'O amiable and timid girl, I will do what thou sayst.<br>Thou wilt behold Sudhanwan and myself met together in the morning.'<br><br>"Vidura continued, 'When the night had passed away and the solar disc had<br>risen, Sudhanwan, O best of kings, came to that place where, O master,<br>Virochana was waiting with Kesini. And Sudhanwan saw there both<br>Prahlada's son and Kesini. And beholding the Brahmana arrived, Kesini, O<br>bull of the Bharata race, rising up from hers, offered him a seat, water<br>to wash his feet, and Arghya. And asked by Virochana (to share his seat)<br>Sudhanwan said, 'O son of Prahlada, I touch thy excellent golden seat. I<br>cannot, however, suffer myself to be regarded as thy equal, and sit on it<br>with thee.' Virochana said, 'A piece of wooden plank, an animal skin, or<br>a mat of grass or straw,&#8212;these only, O Sudhanwan, are fit for thee. Thou<br>deservest not, however, the same seat with me.' Sudhanwan said, 'Father<br>and son. Brahmanas of the same age and equal learning, two Kshatriyas,<br>two Vaisyas and two Sudras, can sit together on the same seat, Except<br>these, no other can sit together. Your father used to pay his regards to<br>me, taking a seat lower than that occupied by me. Thou art a child,<br>brought tip in every luxury at home and thou understandest nothing.'<br>Virochana said, 'Staking all the gold, kine, horses, and every other kind<br>of wealth that we have among the Asuras, let us, O Sudhanwan, ask them<br>this question that are able to answer.' Sudhanwan said, 'Let alone your<br>gold, kine, and heroes, O Virochana? Making our lives forfeited, we will<br>ask them this question that are competent.' Virochana said, 'Wagering our<br>lives where shall we go? I will not appear before any of the gods and<br>never before any among men.' Sudhanwan said, 'Having wagered our lives,<br>we will approach thy father, for he, Prahlada, will never say an untruth<br>even for the sake of his son.'<br><br>"Vidura continued, 'Having thus laid a wager, Virochana and Sudhanwan,<br>both moved by rage, proceeded to that place where Prahlada was. And<br>beholding them together, Prahlada said, 'These two who had never before<br>been companions, are now seen together coming hither by the same road,<br>like two angry snakes. Have ye now become companions,&#8212;ye who were never<br>companions before? I ask thee, O Virochana, has there been friendship<br>between thee and Sudhanwan?' Virochana said, 'There is no friendship<br>between me and Sudhanwan. On the other hand, we have both wagered our<br>lives. O chief of the Asuras, I shall ask thee a question, do not answer<br>it untruly!' Prahlada said, 'Let water, and honey and curds, be brought<br>for Sudhanwan. Thou deservest our worship, O Brahmana. A white and fat<br>cow is ready for thee.' Sudhanwan said, 'Water and honey and curds, have<br>been presented to me on my way hither. I shall ask thee a question.<br>Prahlada, answer it truly! are Brahmanas superior, or is Virochana<br>superior?' Prahlada said, O Brahmana, this one is my only son. Thou also<br>art present here in person. How can one like us answer a question about<br>which ye two have quarrelled? Sudhanwan said, 'Give unto thy son thy kine<br>and other precious wealth that thou mayst have, but, O wise one, thou<br>shouldst declare the truth when we two are disputing about it.' Prahlada<br>said, 'How doth that misuser of his tongue suffer, O Sudhanwan, who<br>answereth not truly but falsely, a question that is put to him? I ask<br>thee this.' Sudhanwan said, 'The person that misuseth his tongue suffers<br>like the deserted wife, who pineth, at night, beholding her husband<br>sleeping in the arms of a co-wife; like a person who hath lost at dice,<br>or who is weighed down with an unbearable load of anxieties. Such a man<br>hath also to stay, starving outside the citygates, into which his<br>admission is barred. Indeed, he that giveth false evidence is destined to<br>always find his foes. He that speaketh a lie on account of an animal,<br>casteth down from heaven five of his sires of the ascending order. He<br>that speaketh a lie on account of a cow casteth down from heaven ten of<br>his ancestors. A lie on account of a horse causeth the downfall of a<br>hundred; and a lie on account of a human being, the downfall of a<br>thousand of one's sires of the ascending order. An untruth on account of<br>gold ruineth the members of one's race both born and unborn, while an<br>untruth for the sake of land ruineth everything. Therefore, never speak<br>an untruth for the sake of land.' Prahlada said, 'Angiras is superior to<br>myself, and Sudhanwan is superior to thee, O Virochana. Mother also of<br>Sudhanwan is superior to thy mother; therefore, thou, O Virochana, hath<br>been defeated by Sudhanwan. This Sudhanwan is now the master of thy life.<br>But, O Sudhanwan, I wish that thou shouldst grant Virochana his life.'<br>Sudhanwan said, 'Since, O Prahlada, thou hast preferred virtue and hast<br>not, from temptation, said an untruth, I grant thy son his life that is<br>dear to thee. So here is thy son Virochana, O Prahlada, restored by me to<br>thee. He shall, however, have to wash my feet in the presence of the<br>maiden Kesini.'<br><br>"Vidura continued, 'For these reasons, O king of kings, it behoveth thee<br>not to say an untruth for the sake of land. Saying an untruth from<br>affection for thy son, O king, hasten not to destruction, with all thy<br>children and counsellors. The gods do not protect men, taking up clubs in<br>their hands after the manner of herdsmen; unto those, however, they wish<br>to protect, they grant intelligence. There is no doubt that one's objects<br>meet with success in proportion to the attention he directs to<br>righteousness and morality. The Vedas never rescue from sin a deceitful<br>person living by falsehood. On the other hand, they forsake him while he<br>is on his death-bed, like newly fledged birds forsaking their nests.<br>Drinking, quarrels, enmity with large numbers of men, all connections<br>with connubial disputes, and severance of relationship between husband<br>and wife, internal dissensions, disloyalty to the king,&#8212;these and all<br>paths that are sinful, should, it is said, be avoided. A palmist, a thief<br>turned into a merchant, a fowler, a physician, an enemy, a friend, and a<br>minstrel, these seven are incompetent as witness. An Agnihotra performed<br>from motives of pride, abstention from speech, practised from similar<br>motives, study and sacrifice from the same motives,&#8212;these four, of<br>themselves innocent, become harmful when practised unduly. One that<br>setteth fire to a dwelling house, an administerer of poison, a pander, a<br>vendor of the Soma-juice, a maker of arrows, an astrologer, one that<br>injureth friends, an adulterer, one that causeth abortion, a violater of<br>his preceptor's bed, a Brahmana addicted to drink, one that is<br>sharp-speeched, a raker of old sores, an atheist, a reviler of the Vedas,<br>and taker of bribes, one whose investiture with the sacred thread has<br>been delayed beyond the prescribed age, one that secretly slayeth cattle,<br>and one that slayeth him who prayeth for protection,&#8212;these all are<br>reckoned as equal in moral turpitude as the slayers of Brahmanas. Gold is<br>tested by fire; a well-born person, by his deportment; an honest man, by<br>his conduct. A brave man is tested during a season of panic; he that is<br>self-controlled, in times of poverty; and friends and foes, in times of<br>calamity and danger. Decrepitude destroyeth beauty; ambitious hopes,<br>patience; death, life, envy, righteousness, anger, prosperity,<br>companionship with the low, good behaviour; lust, modesty, and pride,<br>everything. Prosperity taketh its birth in good deeds, groweth in<br>consequence of activity, driveth its roots deep in consequence of skill,<br>and acquireth stability owing to self-control. Wisdom, good lineage,<br>self-control, acquaintance with the scriptures, prowess, absence of<br>garrulity, gift to the extent of one's power, and grateful ness,&#8212;these<br>eight qualities shed a lustre upon their possessor. But, O sire, there is<br>one endowment which alone can cause all these attributes to come<br>together; the fact is, when the king honoureth a particular person, the<br>royal favour can cause all these attributes to shed their lustre (on the<br>favourite). Those eight, O king, in the world of men, are indications of<br>heaven. Of the eight (mentioned below) four are inseparably connected,<br>with the good, and four others are always followed by the good. The first<br>four which are inseparably connected with the good, are sacrifice, gift,<br>study and asceticism, while the other four that are always followed by<br>the good, are self-restraint, truth, simplicity, and abstention from<br>injury to all.<br><br>'Sacrifice, study, charity, asceticism, truth, forgiveness, mercy, and<br>contentment constitute the eight different paths of righteousness. The<br>first four of these may be practised from motives of pride, but the last<br>four can exist only in those that are truly noble. That is no assembly<br>where there are no old men, and they are not old who do not declare what<br>morality is. That is not morality which is separated from truth, and that<br>is not truth which is fraught with deceit. Truth, beauty, acquaintance<br>with the scriptures, knowledge, high birth, good behaviour, strength,<br>wealth, bravery, and capacity for varied talk,&#8212;these ten are of heavenly<br>origin. A sinful person, by committing sin, is overtaken by evil<br>consequences. A virtuous man, by practising virtue, reapeth great<br>happiness. Therefore, a man, rigidly resolved, should abstain from sin.<br>Sin, repeatedly perpetrated, destroyeth intelligence; and the man who<br>hath lost intelligence, repeatedly committeth sin. Virtue, repeatedly<br>practised, enhanceth intelligence; and the man whose intelligence hath<br>increased, repeatedly practiseth virtue. The virtuous man, by practising<br>virtue, goeth to regions of blessedness. Therefore, a man should, firmly<br>resolved, practise virtue. He that is envious, he that injureth others<br>deeply, he that is cruel, he that constantly quarreleth, he that is<br>deceitful, soon meeteth with great misery for practising these sins. He<br>that is not envious and is possessed of wisdom, by always doing what is<br>good, never meeteth with great misery; on the other hand, he shineth<br>everywhere. He that draweth wisdom from them that are wise is really<br>learned and wise. And he that is wise, by attending to both virtue and<br>profit, succeedeth in attaining to happiness. Do that during the day<br>which may enable thee to pass the night in happiness; and do that during<br>eight months of the year which may enable thee to pass the season of<br>rains happily. Do that during youth which may ensure a happy old age; and<br>do that during thy whole life here which may enable thee to live happily<br>hereafter. The wise prize that food which is easily digested, that wife<br>whose youth hath passed away, that hero who is victorious and that<br>ascetic whose efforts have been crowned with success. The gap that is<br>sought to be filled by wealth acquired wrongfully, remaineth uncovered,<br>while new ones appear in other places. The preceptor controlleth them<br>whose souls are under their own control; the king controlleth persons<br>that are wicked; while they that sin secretly have their controller in<br>Yama, the son of Vivaswat. The greatness of Rishis, of rivers, of<br>river-banks, of high-souled men, and the cause of woman's wickedness,<br>cannot be ascertained. O king, he that is devoted to the worship of the<br>Brahmanas, he that giveth away, he that behaveth righteously towards his<br>relatives, and the Kshatriya that behaveth nobly, rule the earth for<br>ever. He that is possessed of bravery, he that is possessed of learning,<br>and he that knows how to protect others,&#8212;these three are always able to<br>gather flowers of gold from the earth. Of acts, those accomplished by<br>intelligence are first; those accomplished by the arms, second; those by<br>the thighs, and those by bearing weights upon the head, are the very<br>worst. Reposing the care of thy kingdom on Duryodhana, on Sakuni, on<br>foolish Dussasana, and on Karna, how canst thou hope for prosperity?<br>Possessed of every virtue, the Pandavas, O bull of the Bharata race,<br>depend on thee as their father. O, repose thou on them as on thy sons!"
