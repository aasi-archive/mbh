                            "Duryodhana said, 'The son of Pritha are all as other men, and are, in<br>fact, of earthly birth as other men. Why then dost thou think that they<br>are sure to win victory? Both ourselves and they are equal in energy, in<br>prowess, in age, in intelligence, in knowledge of the scriptures, in<br>weapons, in the art of war, in lightness of hand, and in skill. All of us<br>are of the of same species, all being men by birth. How then, O<br>grandsire, dost thou know that victory will be theirs? I do not seek the<br>accomplishment of my aims by relying upon thee, or Drona, or Kripa or<br>Valhika, or upon the other kings. Myself, and Karna, the son of<br>Vikartana, and my brother Dussasana, will slay in battle the five sons of<br>Pandu by sharpened arrows. Then shall we, O king, gratify Brahmanas by<br>performing great sacrifices of diverse kinds, with abundant Dakshinas,<br>and by gifts of kine and horses and wealth. When my troops will drag by<br>the aid of their mighty arms the Pandavas in battle, like hunters<br>dragging a herd of deer by a net, or whirlpools drawing a crewless boat,<br>then the sons of Pandu, beholding us their foe, supported by crowds and<br>cars and elephants, will give up their pride, and not they alone but<br>Kesava also.' Hearing this, Vidura said, 'Venerable persons of infallible<br>knowledge say that in this world self-restraint is highly beneficial. In<br>the case of Brahmana especially, it is his duty. He whose self-restraint<br>followeth charity, asceticism, knowledge, and study of the Vedas, always<br>winneth success, forgiveness, and the fruit of his gifts. Self-restraint<br>enhanceth energy, and is an excellent and holy attribute. Freed from sin<br>and his energy increased by Self-restraint, one acquireth even Brahma<br>through it. People are always afraid of those that are without<br>self-restraint, as if the latter were very Rakshasas. And it is for<br>keeping these under check that the self-Existent created the Kshatriyas.<br>It hath been said that Self-restraint is an excellent vow for all the<br>four modes of life. I regard those attributes as its indications which<br>woe their origin to self-restraint, Those indications are forgiveness,<br>firmness of mind, abstention from injury, an equal regard for all things,<br>truthfulness of speech, simplicity, control over the senses, patience,<br>gentleness of speech, modesty, steadiness, liberality, mildness,<br>contentment, and faith, he that hath self-restraint casteth off Just,<br>avarice, pride, wrath, sleep, boastfulness, self-esteem, malice, and<br>sorrow. Purity and absence of crookedness and fraud, are the distinctive<br>marks of a man of self-restraint. He that is not covetous, that is<br>satisfied with a little, that regardeth not objects provoking lust, and<br>that is as grave as the ocean, is known as a man of self-restraint. He<br>that is well-behaved, of good disposition and contented soul, that<br>knoweth his own self is possessed of wisdom, winneth great regard here<br>and attaineth to a blissful state hereafter. Possessed of mature wisdom,<br>he that hath no fear of other creatures and whom other creatures fear<br>not, is said to be the foremost of men. Seeking the good of all, he is a<br>universal friend, and no one is made unhappy by him. Endued with gravity,<br>like that of the ocean and enjoying contentment in consequence of his<br>wisdom, such a man is always calm and cheerful. Regulating their conduct<br>according to the acts practised by the righteous olden times and before<br>their eyes, they that are self-restrained, being devoted to peace,<br>rejoice in this world. Or, abandoning Action, because contented in<br>consequence of Knowledge, such a person, with his senses under control<br>moveth quickly in this world, waiting for the inevitable hour and<br>absorption into Brahma. And as the track of feathery creatures in the sky<br>is incapable of being perceived, so the path of the sage enjoying<br>contentment in consequence of Knowledge is not visible. Abandoning, the<br>world he that betaketh himself, in pursuit of emancipation, to the<br>Sannyasa mode of life, hath bright and eternal regions assigned to him in<br>heaven.'"
