                            "Narada said, 'Thus addressed by Suparna in excellent words fraught with<br>truth, that performer of thousand sacrifices, that foremost of givers,<br>that liberal ruler of all the Kasis, the lord Yayati, revolving those<br>words in his mind and reflecting on them coolly, and seeing before him<br>his dear friend, Tarkshya, and that bull among Brahmanas, Galava, and<br>regarding the alms sought as an indication, highly praiseworthy, of<br>(Galava's) ascetic merit, and in view particularly of the fact that those<br>two came to him having passed over all the kings of the Solar race, said,<br>'Blessed is my life today, and the race also in which I am born, hath,<br>indeed, been blessed today. This very province also of mine hath equally<br>been blessed by thee, O sinless Tarkshya. There is one thing, however, O<br>friend, that I desire to say unto thee, and that is, I am not so rich now<br>as thou thinkest, for my wealth hath suffered a great diminution. I<br>cannot, however, O ranger of the skies, make thy advent here a fruitless<br>one. Nor can I venture to frustrate the hopes entertained by this<br>regenerate Rishi. I shall, therefore, give him that which will accomplish<br>his purpose. If one having come for alms, returneth disappointed, he may<br>consume the (host's) race. O son of Vinata, it is said that there is no<br>act more sinful than that of saying, 'I have nothing'&#8212;and thus<br>destroying the hope of one that cometh, saying, 'Give.' The disappointed<br>man whose hopes have been killed and his object not accomplished, can<br>destroy the sons and grandsons of the person that faileth to do him good.<br>Therefore, O Galava, take thou this daughter of mine, this perpetrator of<br>four families. In beauty, she resembleth a daughter of the celestials.<br>She is capable of prompting every virtue. Indeed, owing to her beauty,<br>she is always solicited (at my hands) by gods and men, and Asuras. Let<br>alone twice four hundred steeds each with a black ear, the kings of the<br>earth will give away their whole kingdoms as her dower. Take thou,<br>therefore, this daughter of mine, named Madhavi. My sole desire is that I<br>may have a daughter's son by her. Accepting that daughter in gift, Galava<br>then, with Garuda, went away, saying, 'We will again see thee'. And they<br>took that maiden with them. And Galava's oviparous friend addressed him,<br>saying, 'The means have at last been obtained whereby the steeds may be<br>obtained.' And saying this, Garuda went away to his own abode, having<br>obtained Galava's permission. And after the prince of birds had gone,<br>Galava, with that maiden in his company, began to think of going to some<br>one among the kings who would be able to give (fit) dower for the maiden.<br>And he first thought of that best of kings, Haryyaswa of Ikshaku's race,<br>who ruled at Ayodhya, was endued with great energy, possessed of a large<br>army consisting of four kinds of forces, had a well-filled treasury and<br>abundance of corn, and who was dearly loved by his subjects, and who<br>loved the Brahmanas well. Desirous of offspring, he was living in quiet<br>and peace, and engaged in excellent austerities. And the Brahmana Galava,<br>repairing unto Haryyaswa, said, 'This maiden, O king of kings, will<br>increase the family of her husband by bringing forth offspring. Accept<br>her from me, O Haryyaswa, as thy wife, by giving me a dower. I will tell<br>thee what dower thou shalt have to give. Hearing it, settle what thou<br>shalt do.'"
