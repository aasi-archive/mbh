                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Recollecting the words spoken by Vasudeva,<br>Yudhishthira once more addressed that scion of Vrishni's race, saying,<br>'How, O Kesava, could wicked Duryodhana say it? O thou of unfading glory,<br>what should we do in view of the occasion that hath come? By acting in<br>what way may we keep on the track of our duty? Thou, O Vasudeva, art<br>acquainted with the views of Duryodhana, Karna, and Sakuni, the son of<br>Suvala. Thou knowest also what views are entertained by myself and my<br>brothers. Thou hast heard the words uttered by both Vidura and Bhishma. O<br>thou of great wisdom, thou hast also heard in their entirety the words of<br>wisdom spoken by Kunti. Overlooking all these, tell us, O thou of mighty<br>arms, after reflection, and without hesitation, what is for our good.'<br><br>"Hearing these words of king Yudhishthira the Just, that were fraught<br>with virtue and profit. Krishna replied, in a voice deep as that of the<br>clouds or cymbals, saying, 'Responding to his advantage and consistent<br>with both virtue and profit, those words that were uttered by me in the<br>Kuru court found no response in the Kuru prince Duryodhana with whom<br>deceit supplieth the place of wisdom. That wretch of wicked understanding<br>listeneth not in the least to the counsels of Bhishma or Vidura or mine.<br>He transgresseth everybody. He wisheth not to earn virtue, nor doth he<br>wish for fame. That wicked-souled wight, relying upon Karna, regardeth<br>everything as already won. Indeed, Suyodhana of wicked heart and sinful<br>in his resolves, even ordered my incarceration but he did not, however,<br>obtain the fruition of that wish. Neither Bhishma nor Drona said anything<br>on that subject. Indeed, all of them follow Duryodhana, except Vidura, O<br>thou of unfading glory, Sakuni, the son of Suvala, and Karna, and<br>Dussasana, all equally foolish, gave foolish and vindictive Duryodhana<br>much improper advice regarding thee. Indeed, what use is there in my<br>repeating to thee all that the Kuru prince hath said? In brief, that<br>wicked-souled wight beareth no good will towards thee. Not even in all<br>these kings together, that form thy army, is that measure of sinfulness<br>and wickedness which resideth in Duryodhana alone. As regards ourselves,<br>we do not desire to make peace with the Kauravas by abandoning our<br>property. War, therefore, is that which should now take place.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words uttered by Vasudeva, all<br>the kings (there present), O Bharata, without saying anything, looked at<br>Yudhishthira's face. And Yudhishthira, understanding the intention of<br>those monarchs, said, with Bhima and Arjuna and the twins, 'Draw up the<br>troops in battle array.' And the word of command having been passed, a<br>great uproar rose amongst the Pandava army and all the soldiers were<br>filled with joy. King Yudhishthira the Just, however, beholding the<br>(impending) slaughter of those that deserved not to be slain, began to<br>sigh deeply, and addressing Bhimasena and Vijaya, said, 'That for the<br>sake of which I accepted an exile into the woods and for which I suffered<br>so much misery, that great calamity overtaketh us of a set purpose. That<br>for which we strove so much leaveth us as if on account of our very<br>striving. On the other hand, a great distress overtaketh us, although we<br>did nothing to invite it. How shall we fight with those reverend<br>superiors (of ours) whom we on no account can slay? What kind of victory<br>shall we achieve by slaying our preceptors of venerable age?'<br><br>"Hearing these words of king Yudhishthira the Just, Savyasachin repeated<br>to his elder brother all those words that Vasudeva had said. And<br>addressing Yudhishthira, Arjuna continued, 'Thou hast, O king, certainly<br>understood all the words spoken by Kunti and Vidura, that were repeated<br>to thee by Devaki's son. I know it for certain that neither Vidura nor<br>Kunti would say anything that is sinful. Besides this, O son of Kunti, we<br>cannot withdraw without engaging in battle.'<br><br>"Hearing this speech of Savyasachin, Vasudeva also said unto Partha, 'It<br>is even so (as thou hast said). The sons of Pandu then, O great king,<br>made up their minds for war, and passed that night with their soldiers in<br>great happiness.'"
