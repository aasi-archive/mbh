                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Having heard his words, Bhishma, senior in wisdom,<br>and endued with great effulgence, paid honours to him, and then spoke<br>words suitable to the occasion. And he said, 'How fortunate that they are<br>all well, with Krishna! How fortunate that they have procured aid, and<br>that they are inclined to a virtuous course! How fortunate that those<br>scions of Kuru's race desire peace with their cousins! There is no doubt<br>that what thou hast said is true. Thy words, however, are exceedingly<br>sharp,&#8212;the reason, I suppose, being that thou art a Brahmana. No doubt,<br>the sons of Pandu were much harassed both here and in woods. No doubt, by<br>law they are entitled to get all the property of their father. Arjuna,<br>the son of Pritha, is strong trained in weapons, and is a great<br>car-warrior. Who, in sooth, can withstand in battle Dhananjaya the son of<br>Pandu. Even the wielder himself of the thunderbolt cannot,&#8212;other bowmen<br>are hardly worth mention. My belief is that he is a match for all the<br>three worlds!' And while Bhishma was thus speaking, Karna wrathfully and<br>insolently interrupted his words, and looking at Duryodhana said, 'There<br>is no creature in the world, O Brahmana, who is not informed of all these<br>facts. What is the good of repeating them again and again? On behalf of<br>Duryodhana, Sakuni formerly won in game of dice. Yudhishthira, the son of<br>Pandu went to the woods according to a stipulation. He is now paying no<br>regard to that stipulation, but confident of aid from the Matsyas and<br>Panchalas, he wisheth to get back his ancestral throne. O learned man,<br>Duryodhana would not yield even a single foot of land if thou appealest<br>to his fears, but if justice requires, he would give up the whole earth<br>even to a foe. If they wish to get back their ancestral throne, they<br>should pass the specified period of time in the forest as had been<br>stipulated. Afterwards let them live as the dependants of Duryodhana,<br>safe and sound. From dull-headedness, however, let them not turn their<br>mind towards an absolutely unrighteous course. If, nevertheless,<br>abandoning the path of virtue, they desire war, then when they encounter<br>in battle these praise-worthy Kurus, they will remember these my words.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'What is the use of thy talking, O Radha's son? Thou<br>shouldst remember that occasion when Pritha's son, single-handed,<br>over-powered in battle six car-warriors. If we do not act as this<br>Brahmana hath said, to be sure, we shall be all slain by him in battle!"<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then Dhritarashtra pacified Bhishma with words<br>of entreaty, rebuked the son of Radha, and spoke the following words,<br>What Bhishma, Santanu's son, hath said is salutary for us, as also for<br>the Pandavas, and likewise for the whole universe. I shall, however,<br>after deliberation, send Sanjaya to the sons of Pandu. So thou needst not<br>wait. Go thou to the son of Pandu this very day.' The Kaurava chief then<br>honoured Drupada's priest and sent him back to the Pandavas. And<br>summoning Sanjaya to the council-hall, he addressed him in the following<br>words."
