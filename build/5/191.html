                            "Duryodhana said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, how Sikhandin, O Ganga's son,<br>having before been born a daughter, afterwards became a man, O foremost<br>of warriors.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'O great king, the eldest and beloved queen of king<br>Drupada was, O monarch, childless (at first). During those years, king<br>Drupada, O monarch, paid his adoration to the god Sankara for the sake of<br>offspring, resolving in his mind to compass my destruction and practising<br>the austerest of penances. And he begged Mahadeva, saying, 'Let a son,<br>and not a daughter, be born unto me. I desire, O god, a son for revenging<br>myself upon Bhishma.' Thereupon, that god of gods said unto him, 'Thou<br>shalt have a child who will be a female and male. Desist, O king, it will<br>not be otherwise.' Returning then to his capital, he addressed his wife,<br>saying, 'O great goddess, great hath been the exertion made by me.<br>Undergoing ascetic austerities, I paid my adorations to Siva, and I was<br>told by Sambhu that my child becoming a daughter (first) would<br>subsequently become a male person. And though I solicited him repeatedly,<br>yet Siva said,&#8212;This is Destiny's decree. It will not be otherwise. That<br>which is destined must take place!' Then that lady of great energy, the<br>queen of king Drupada, when her season came, observing all the<br>regulations (about purity), approached Drupada. And in due time the wife<br>of Prishata conceived, agreeably to Destiny's decree, as I was informed,<br>O king, by Narada. And that lady, of eyes like lotus-petals, continued to<br>hold the embryo in her womb. And, O son of Kuru's race, the mighty-armed<br>king Drupada, from paternal affection, attended to every comfort of that<br>dear wife of his. And, O Kaurava, the wife of that lord of earth, the<br>royal Drupada, who was childless, had all her wishes gratified. And in<br>due time, O monarch, that goddess, the queen of Drupada, gave birth to a<br>daughter of great beauty. Thereupon, the strong-minded wife of that king,<br>the childless Drupada, gave out, O monarch, that the child she had<br>brought forth was a son. And then king Drupada, O ruler of men, caused<br>all the rites prescribed for a male child to be performed in respect of<br>that misrepresented daughter, as if she were really a son. And saying<br>that the child was a son, Drupada's queen kept her counsels very<br>carefully. And no other man in the city, save Prishata, knew the sex of<br>that child. Believing these words of that deity of unfading energy, he<br>too concealed the real sex of his child, saying,&#8212;She is a son. And, O<br>king, Drupada caused all the rites of infancy, prescribed for a son, to<br>be performed in respect of that child, and he bestowed the name of<br>Sikhandin on her. I alone, through my spies and from Narada's words, knew<br>the truth, informed as I previously was of the words of the god and of<br>the ascetic austerities of Amva!'"
