                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Whom hast thou, O Sanjaya, seen to have, from<br>affection, arrived there, and who will, on behalf of the Pandavas, fight<br>my son's forces?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'I have seen Krishna, the foremost of the Andhakas and the<br>Vrishnis, arrived there, and Chekitana, as also Satyaki, otherwise called<br>Yuyudhana. And those two mighty car-warriors, proud of their strength and<br>famed over all the world, have joined the Pandavas, each with a separate<br>Akshauhini of troops. And Drupada, the king of the Panchalas, surrounded<br>by his ten heroic sons&#8212;Satyajit and others&#8212;headed by Dhrishtadyumna,<br>and well-protected by Sikhandin, and having furnished his soldiers with<br>every necessary thing, hath come there with a full Akshauhini, desirous<br>of honouring Yudhishthira. And that lord of earth, Virata, with his two<br>sons Sankha and Uttara, as also with those heroes Suryadatta and<br>others&#8212;headed by Madiraksha and surrounded by one Akshauhini of troops,<br>hath thus accompanied by brothers and sons, joined the son of Pritha. And<br>the son of Jarasandha, the king of Magadha, and Dhrishtaketu, the king of<br>the Chedis, have separately come there, each accompanied by an Akshauhini<br>of troops. And the five brothers of Kekaya, all having purple flags, have<br>joined the Pandavas, surrounded by an Akshauhini of troops. Then<br>numbering to this extent, have I seen assembled there, and these, on<br>behalf of the Pandavas, will encounter the Dhartarashtra host. That great<br>car-warrior, Dhrishtadyumna, who is acquainted with human, celestial,<br>Gandharva and Asura arrays of battle, leadeth that host. O king, Bhishma,<br>the son of Santanu, has been assigned to Sikhandin as his share; and<br>Virata with all his Matsya warriors will support Sikhandin. The mighty<br>king of the Madras hath been assigned to the eldest son of Pandu as his<br>share, though some are of opinion that those two are not well-matched.<br>Duryodhana with his sons and his ninety-nine brothers, as also the rulers<br>of the east and the south, have been assigned to Bhimasena as his share.<br>Karna, the son of Vikartana, and Jayadratha the king of the Sindhus, have<br>been assigned to Arjuna as his share. And those heroes also on the earth<br>who are incapable of being withstood and who are proud of their might,<br>have been accepted by Arjuna as his share. And those mighty bowmen, the<br>five royal brothers of Kekaya, will put forth their strength in battle,<br>accepting the Kekaya warriors (on Dhritarashtra's side) as antagonists.<br>And in their share are included the Malavas also, and the Salwakas, as<br>also, the two famous warriors of the Trigarta host who have sworn to<br>conquer or die. And all the sons of Duryodhana and Dussasana, as also<br>king Vrihadvala, have been assigned to Subhadra's son as his share. And<br>those great bowmen, the sons of Draupadi, having cars furnished with<br>gold-embroidered banners, all headed by Dhrishtadyumna, will, O Bharata,<br>advance against Drona. And Chekitana on his car desireth to encounter<br>Somadatta in single combat with him, while Satyaki is anxious to battle<br>against the Bhoja chief, Kritavarman. And the heroic son of Madri,<br>Sahadeva, who setteth up terrible roars in battle, hath intended to take<br>as his share thy brother-in-law, the son of Suvala. And Nakula also, the<br>son of Madravati, hath intended to take as his share the deceitful Uluka<br>and the tribes of the Saraswatas. As for all the other kings of the<br>earth, O Monarch, who will go to battle, the sons of Pandu have, by<br>naming them, distributed them in their own respective shares. Thus hath<br>the Pandava host been distributed into divisions. Do thou now, without<br>delay, with thy sons, act as thou thinkest best.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Alas, all my foolish sons, addicted to deceitful<br>dice, are already dead when it is the mighty Bhima with whom they desire<br>to encounter in the field of battle. All the kings of the earth too,<br>consecrated by Death himself for sacrifice, will rush to the Gandiva,<br>like so many moths into fire. Methinks my host is already put to flight<br>by those illustrious warriors formerly injured by me. Who, indeed, shall<br>follow to battle my warriors, whose ranks will be broken by the sons of<br>Pandu in the encounter? All of them are mighty car-warriors, possessed of<br>great bravery, of famous achievements, endued with great prowess, equal<br>unto the fiery sun in energy, and all victorious in battle. Those that<br>have Yudhishthira for their leader, the slayer of Madhu for their<br>protector, the heroic Savyasachin and Vrikodara for their warriors, and<br>Nakula, and Sahadeva, and Dhrishtadyumna, the son of Prishata, and<br>Satyaki, and Drupada, and Dhrishtaketu with his son, and Uttamaujas, and<br>the unconquerable Yudhamanyu of the Panchalas, and Sikhandin, and<br>Kshatradeva, and Uttara, the son of Virata, and Kasayas, the Chedis, the<br>Matsyas, the Srinjayas, Vabhru the son of Virata, the Panchalas, and the<br>Prabhadrakas, for fighting for them, those, indeed, from whom Indra<br>himself cannot, if they are unwilling, snatch this earth,&#8212;those heroes,<br>cool and steady, in fight, who can split the very mountains&#8212;alas, it is<br>with them that are endued with every virtue and possessed of superhuman<br>prowess that this wicked son of mine, O Sanjaya, desireth to fight,<br>disregarding me even though I am crying myself hoarse!'<br><br>"Duryodhana said, 'Both the Pandavas and ourselves are of the same race;<br>both they and we tread upon the same earth, why dost thou think that<br>victory will declare itself for only the Pandavas? Bhishma, Drona, Kripa,<br>the unconquerable Karna, Jayadratha, Somadatta, and Aswatthaman-all<br>mighty bowmen and endued with great energy,&#8212;are incapable of being<br>vanquished by Indra himself united with the celestials. What sayst thou<br>then, O father of the Pandavas? Ali these noble and heroic kings of the<br>earth, bearing weapons, O father, are quite capable, for my sake, of<br>withstanding the Pandavas, while the latter are not capable of even<br>gazing at my troops. I am powerful enough to encounter in battle the<br>Pandavas with their sons. O Bharata, all those rulers of the earth, who<br>are anxious for my welfare, will certainly seize all the Pandavas like a<br>herd of young deer by means of net. I tell thee, in consequence of our<br>crowds of cars and snares of arrows, the Panchalas and the Pandavas will<br>all be routed.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'O Sanjaya, this my son speaketh like a mad man, for<br>he is incapable of vanquishing in battle Yudhishthira the just. This<br>Bhishma truly knoweth the might of the famous, powerful, virtuous, and<br>high-souled Pandavas and their sons, for he doth not wish a battle with<br>those illustrious ones. But tell me again O Sanjaya, of their movements.<br>Tell me, who are inciting those illustrious and mighty bowmen endued with<br>great activity, like priests enkindling (Homa) fires with libations of<br>clarified butter?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'O Bharata, Dhrishtadyumna is always urging the Pandavas<br>to war, saying, 'Fight ye, best among the Bharatas. Do not entertain the<br>least fear. All those rulers of the earth, who, courted by<br>Dhritarashtra's son, will become in that fierce encounter target of<br>showers of weapons,&#8212;indeed, I alone will encounter all those angry kings<br>assembled together with their relatives, like a whale seizing little<br>fishes from the water. Bhishma and Drona and Kripa and Karna and Drona's<br>son and Salya and Suyodhana,&#8212;them all I withstand, like the bank<br>resisting the swelling sea.' Unto him saying thus, the virtuous king<br>Yudhishthira said, 'The Panchalas and the Pandavas wholly depend upon thy<br>prowess and steadiness. Rescue us safely from the war. I know, O<br>mighty-armed one, that thou art firm in the duties of the Kshatriya<br>order. Thou art, indeed, quite competent to smite alone the Kauravas.<br>When the latter, eager for fight, will stand before us, what thou, O<br>repressor of foes, wilt arrange, will certainly be for our good. Even<br>this is the opinion of those acquainted with the scriptures, that the<br>hero, who, displaying his prowess, relieth those that after the rout run<br>away from the battle-field, seeking for protection, is to be bought with<br>a thousand. Thou, O bull among men, art brave, mighty, and powerful.<br>Without doubt, thou art that deliverer of those that are over-powered<br>with fear on the field of battle.' And when the righteous Yudhishthira<br>the son of Kunti said this, Dhrishtadyumna fearlessly addressed me in<br>these words, 'Go thou, O Suta, without delay, and say unto all those that<br>have come to fight for Duryodhana, say unto the Kurus of the Pratipa<br>dynasty with the Vahlikas, the son of Saradwata and Karna and Drona, and<br>Drona's son, and Jayadratha, and Dussasana, and Vikarna and king<br>Duryodhana, and Bhishma,&#8212;Do not suffer yourselves to be slain by Arjuna,<br>who is protected by the celestials. Before that happens, let some good<br>man approach Yudhishthira and entreat that son of Pandu, that best of<br>men, to accept the kingdom (surrendered by them) without delay. There is<br>no warrior on the earth like unto Savyasachin, son of Pandu, of prowess<br>incapable of being baffled. The celestial car of the holder of Gandiva is<br>protected by the very gods. He is incapable of being vanquished by human<br>beings. Do not, therefore, bend your mind to war!'"
