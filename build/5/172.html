                            "Bhishma said, 'That subjugator of hostile cities, Sikhandin, the son of<br>the king of the Panchalas, is, O king, in my judgment, one of the<br>foremost of Yudhishthira's Rathas. Having divested himself on his former<br>sex, he will fight in battle and earn great fame, O Bharata, among thy<br>troops! He hath a large number of troops,&#8212;Panchalas and<br>Prabhadrakas,&#8212;to support him. With those hosts of cars he will achieve<br>great feats. Dhrishtadyumna also, O Bharata, the leader of all<br>Yudhishthira's army, that mighty car-warrior who is also a disciple of<br>Drona, is, O king, in my judgment, an Atiratha. Afflicting all foes in<br>battle, he will singly sweep the field, like Pinaka,&#8212;bearing God himself<br>in rage on the occasion of the universal dissolution. Even great warriors<br>will speak of his car-divisions, so multitudinous are they, as resembling<br>the very ocean or that of the gods, in battle! Kshattradharman, the son<br>of Dhrishtadyumna, owing to his immature years, as also in consequence of<br>his want of exercise in arms, is, in my judgment, O king, only half a<br>Ratha. That relative of the Pandavas, the mighty bowman Dhrishtaketu, the<br>heroic son of Sisupala, the king of the Chedis, is a Maharatha. That<br>brave ruler of the Chedis will, O king, with his son, achieve feats such<br>as are difficult for even a Maharatha. Kshattradeva, that subjugator of<br>hostile cities, who is devoted to Kshatriya virtues, is, O great king, in<br>my judgment, one of the best Rathas among the Pandavas. Those brave<br>warriors among the Panchalas, viz., Jayanta and Amitaujas and the great<br>car-warrior Satyajit are all, O king, high-souled Maharathas. They will<br>all, O sire, fight in battle like furious elephants. Aja and Bhoja, both<br>endued with great prowess, are both Maharathas. Possessed of great might,<br>those two heroes will fight for the Pandavas. Both of them are endued<br>with great lightness of hand in the use of weapons. Both of them are<br>conversant with all the modes of warfare, both are well-skilled and<br>possessed of firm prowess. The five Kshatriya brothers, O king, who are<br>difficult of being vanquished, and all of whom have blood red banners,<br>are foremost of the Rathas. Kasika, and Sukumara, and Nila, and that<br>other one, viz., Suryadatta, and Sankha, otherwise called Madiraswa, are<br>all in my judgment, the foremost of Rathas. Possessed of every<br>qualification that renders them fit for battle, they are acquainted with<br>all weapons, and all of them are endued with high souls. Vardhakshemi, O<br>king, is in my judgment, a Maharatha. King Chitrayudha is, in my<br>judgment, one of the best of Rathas. He is, besides, an asset in battle<br>and devotedly attached to the diadem-decked (Arjuna). Those mighty<br>car-warriors, those tigers among men, Chekitana, and Satyadhriti, are two<br>of the best Rathas of the Pandavas in my judgment. Vyaghradatta, O<br>monarch, and Chandrasena also, O Bharata, are without doubt two of the<br>best Rathas, as I think, of the Pandavas. Senavindu, O king, otherwise<br>called Krodhahantri by name, who, O lord, is regarded as equal of<br>Vasudeva and of Bhimasena, will contend with great prowess in battle<br>against your warriors. Indeed, that best of kings, ever boasting of his<br>feats in battle, should be regarded by thee, precisely as myself, Drona<br>and Kripa are regarded by thee! That best of men, worthy of praise, viz.,<br>Kasya, is endued with great lightness of hand in the use of weapons.<br>Indeed, that subjugator of hostile cities is known to me as equal to one<br>Ratha. Drupada's son, Satyajit, young in years and displaying great<br>prowess in battle, should be regarded as equal to eight Rathas. Indeed<br>being Dhrishtadyumna's equal, he is an Atiratha. Desirous of spreading<br>the fame of the Pandavas, he will achieve great feats. Devoted to the<br>Pandavas and endued with great bravery, there is another great Ratha of<br>the Pandavas, viz., king Pandya, that bowman of mighty energy. The mighty<br>bowman Dhridadhanwan is another Maharatha of the Pandavas. O subjugator<br>of hostile cities, that foremost of Kurus, viz., Srenimat and king<br>Vasudeva are both, in my judgment, Atirathas.'"
