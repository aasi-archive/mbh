                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'How hast thou, O Sanjaya, been able to know Madhava<br>as the Supreme Lord of the universe? And how is it that I am unable to<br>know Him as such? Tell me this, O Sanjaya.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Listen, O king! Thou hast no Knowledge, whereas my<br>Knowledge hath suffered no diminution. He that is without Knowledge and<br>is shrouded with the darkness of ignorance, knoweth not Kesava. Aided by<br>my knowledge, O sire, I know the slayer of Madhu to be the union of the<br>Gross, the subtle and the Cause; and that He is the Creator of all, but<br>is Himself increate; and also that, endued with Divinity, it is He from<br>whom everything springs and it is He unto whom all things return.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'O son of Gavalgana, what is the nature of that<br>Faith which thou hast in Janardana and in consequence of which thou<br>knowest the slayer of Madhu to be the union of the Gross, the Subtle, and<br>the Cause?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Blessed be thou, O king, I have no regard for the<br>illusion (that is identified with worldly pleasures) and I never practise<br>the useless virtues (of vows and work without reliance on Him and purity<br>of Soul). Having obtained purity of Soul through Faith, I have known<br>Janardana from the scriptures.<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'O Duryodhana, seek thou the protection of<br>Janardana, otherwise called Hrishikesa. O child, Sanjaya is one of our<br>trustiest friends. Seek refuge with Kesava.'<br><br>"Duryodhana said, 'If the divine son of Devaki united in friendship with<br>Arjuna, were to slay all mankind, I cannot, even then, resign myself to<br>Kesava.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'This evil-minded son of thine, O Gandhari, is<br>resolved to sink in misery. Envious, wicked-souled, and vain, he setteth<br>aside the words of all his superiors.'<br><br>"Gandhari said, 'Thou covetous wretch that disregardest the commands of<br>the aged, abandoning thy father and myself and giving up prosperity and<br>life, enhancing the joy of thy foes, and afflicting me with deep<br>distress, thou wilt, O fool, remember thy father's words, when struck by<br>Bhimasena, thou wilt bite the dust.'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'Listen to me, O king! Thou, O Dhritarashtra, art the<br>beloved of Krishna. When Sanjaya hath been thy envoy, he will verily lead<br>thee to thy good. He knoweth Hrishikesa,&#8212;that ancient and exalted One.<br>If thou listenest to him with attention, he will certainly save thee from<br>the great danger that hangs upon thee. O son of Vichitravirya, subject to<br>wrath and joy, men are entangled in various snares. They that are not<br>contented with their own possessions, deprived of sense as they are by<br>avarice and desire, they repeatedly become subject to Death in<br>consequence of their own acts, like blind men (falling into pits) when<br>led by the blind. The path that is trod by the wise is the only one (that<br>leadeth to Brahma). They that are superior, keeping that path of view,<br>overcome death and reach the goal by it.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Tell me, O Sanjaya, of that path without terrors by<br>which, obtaining Hrishikesa, salvation may be mine.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'A man of uncontrolled mind can by no means know Janardana<br>whose soul is under perfect command. The performance of sacrifices<br>without controlling one's senses is even no means to that end.<br>Renunciation of the objects of our excited senses is due to spiritual<br>light; both spiritual light and abstention from injury arise doubtless<br>from true wisdom. Therefore, O king, resolve to subdue thy senses with<br>all possible vigour; let not thy intellect deviate from true knowledge;<br>and restrain thy heart from worldly temptations that surround it. Learned<br>Brahmanas describe this subjugation of the senses to be true wisdom; and<br>this wisdom is the path by which learned men proceed to their goal. O<br>king, Kesava is not obtainable by men who have not subdued their senses.<br>He that hath subdued his senses, desireth spiritual knowledge, awakened<br>by the knowledge of scriptures and the pleasure of Yaga-absorption.'
