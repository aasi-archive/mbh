                            "Bhishma said, 'After the night had passed away, I awoke, O Bharata, and<br>thinking of my dream I was filled with great joy. Then, O Bharata, the<br>combat began between him and me&#8212;a combat that was fierce and unrivalled<br>and that made the hairs of all creatures stand on their ends. And<br>Bhargava poured on me an arrowy shower which I baffled with an arrowy<br>shower of mine. Then filled with wrath at what he had seen the day before<br>and what he saw that day, Rama hurled at me a dart, hard as Indra's<br>thunderbolt and possessed of effulgence, resembling the Yama's mace! It<br>came towards me like a blazing flame of fire and drinking up, as it were,<br>all the quarters of that field of battle! Then, O tiger among the Kurus,<br>it fell, O perpetuator of Kuru's line, upon my shoulder, like the<br>lightning's flame that ranges the sky. Wounded thus by Rama, O thou of<br>red eyes, my blood, O mighty-armed one, began to flow copiously like<br>streams of red earth from a mountain (after a shower)! Filled with great<br>wrath, I then shot at Jamadagni's son a deadly shaft, fatal as the poison<br>of a snake. That heroic and best of Brahmanas, struck therewith at the<br>forehead, O monarch, then appeared as beautiful as a crested hill!<br>Extremely angry, that hero then, changing his position and drawing the<br>bow-string with great strength, aimed at me a terrible shaft resembling<br>all-destructive Death himself, and capable of grinding all foes! That<br>fierce arrow fell upon my breast, hissing (through the air) like a snake.<br>Covered with blood, I fell down on the earth, O king, thus struck.<br>Regaining consciousness, I hurled at Jamadagni's son a frightful dart,<br>effulgent as the thunderbolt. That dart fell upon the bosom of that<br>foremost of Brahmanas. Deprived of his senses at this, Rama began to<br>tremble all over. That great ascetic then, viz., his friend, the<br>regenerate Akritavrana, embraced him and with diverse words of comfort<br>soothed him. Reassured thus, Rama of high vows was then filled with wrath<br>and vindictiveness. He invoked the great Brahma weapon. For baffling it I<br>also used the same excellent weapon. Clashing against each other, the two<br>weapons began to blaze forth brightly, showing what happens at the end of<br>the Yuga! Without being able to reach either myself or Rama, those two<br>weapons, O best of the Bharatas, met each other in the mid-air. Then the<br>whole welkin seemed to be ablaze, and all creatures, O monarch, became<br>highly distressed. Afflicted by the energy of those weapons, the Rishis,<br>the Gandharvas, and the gods were all greatly pained. Then earth, with<br>her mountains and seas and trees began to tremble, and all creatures,<br>heated with the energy of the weapons, were greatly afflicted. The<br>firmament, O king, became ablaze and the ten points of the horizon became<br>filled with smoke. Creatures, therefore, that range the welkin were<br>unable to stay in their element. When, at all this, the whole world with<br>the gods, the Asuras and the Rakshasas began to utter exclamations of<br>woe.&#8212;This is the time&#8212;thought I and became desirous, O Bharata, of<br>speedily shooting the Praswapa weapon at the command of those utterers of<br>Brahma (that had appeared to me in my dream)! The Mantras also for<br>invoking excellent weapon suddenly came to my mind!'"
