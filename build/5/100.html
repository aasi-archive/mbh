                            "Narada continued, 'Here is that spacious and celebrated city of cities,<br>called Hiranyapura, belonging to the Daityas and Danavas, possessing a<br>hundred diverse kinds of illusion. Here in these regions called Patala,<br>it hath been built with great care by the divine artificer, and planned<br>by the Danava Maya. Endued with great energy and heroism, many Danavas,<br>having obtained boons (from Brahman) in days of old, lived here,<br>exhibiting a thousand different kinds of illusion. They were incapable of<br>being vanquished by Sakra or any other celestial, that is, by either<br>Yama, or Varuna, or the Lord of treasures (Kuvera). Here dwell, O Matali,<br>those Asuras called Kalakhanjas who sprang from Vishnu, and those<br>Rakshasas also called Yatudhanas who sprang from the feet of Brahman. All<br>of them are endued with frightful teeth, terrible impetus, the speed and<br>prowess of the wind, and great energy depending on powers of illusion.<br>Besides these, another class of Danavas called Nivatakavachas, who are<br>invincible in battle, have their abode here. Thou knowest bow Sakra is<br>unable to vanquish them. Many times, O Matali, thou, with thy son<br>Gomukha, and the chief of the celestials and lord of Sachi, along with<br>his son, had to retreat before them. Behold their homes, O Matali, that<br>are all made of silver and gold, and well-adorned with decorations done<br>according to the rules of art. All those mansions are decked with lapis<br>lazuli and corals, and made effulgent with the lustre of the<br>Arkasphatika, and the radiance of gem called Vajrasara. And many of those<br>palatial residences seem, as if, they have been made of the shine of<br>these gems called Padmaragas, or of bright marble, or of excellent wood.<br>And they are also possessed of the radiance of the sun, or blazing fire.<br>And all the edifices, adorned with gems and jewels, are very high and<br>stand close to another. Of spacious proportions and great architectural<br>beauty, it is impossible to say of what material these mansions are built<br>or to describe their style of beauty. Indeed, they are exceedingly<br>beautiful in consequence of their decorations. Behold these retreats of<br>the Daityas for recreation and sport, these beds of theirs for sleep,<br>these costly utensils of theirs set with precious stones, and these seats<br>also for their use. Behold these hills of theirs, looking like clouds,<br>those fountains of water, these trees also that move of their own will<br>and that yield all fruits and flowers that one may ask. See, O Matali, if<br>any bridegroom may be had here, acceptable to thee. If no one can be<br>found, we shalt, if thou likest, go hence to some other part of the<br>world.' Thus addressed, Matali answered Narada, saying, 'O celestial<br>Rishi, it behoveth me not to do anything that may be disagreeable to<br>dwellers of heaven. The gods and the Danavas, though brothers, are ever<br>at hostility with each other. How can I, therefore, make an alliance with<br>those that are our enemies? Let us repair, therefore, to some other<br>place. It behoveth me not to search among the Danavas. As regards<br>thyself, I know thy heart is ever set on fomenting quarrels.'"
