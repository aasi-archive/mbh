                            "The holy one said, It was only through affection that I said all this,<br>desiring to know thy mind, and not from the desire of reproaching thee,<br>nor from pride of learning, nor from wrath, nor from desire of making a<br>speech. I know thy magnanimity of soul, and also thy strength, and thy<br>deeds. It is not for that reason that I reproached thee. O son of Pandu,<br>a thousand times greater will be the benefit conferred by thee on the<br>Pandava's cause than that which thou thinkest thyself to be capable of<br>conferring on it. Thou, O Bhima, with thy kinsmen and friends, art<br>exactly that which one should be that has taken his birth in a family<br>like thine, that is regarded by all the kings of the earth. The fact,<br>however, is that they can never arrive at the truth, who under the<br>influence of doubt proceed to enquire about the consequences hereafter of<br>virtue and vice, or about the strength and weakness of men. For it is<br>seen that what is the cause of the success of a person's object becometh<br>also the cause of his ruin. Human acts, therefore, are doubtful in their<br>consequences. Learned men, capable of judging of the evils of actions<br>pronounce a particular course of action as worthy of being followed. It<br>produces, however, consequences, the very opposite of what were foreseen,<br>very much like the course of the wind. Indeed, even those acts of men<br>that are the results of deliberation and well-directed policy, and that<br>are consistent with considerations of propriety, are baffled by the<br>dispensations of Providence. Then, again, Providential dispensations,<br>such as heat and cold and rain and hunger and thirst, that are not the<br>consequences of human acts, may be baffled by human exertion. Then again,<br>besides those acts which a person is pre-ordained (as the result of the<br>act of past lives) to go through, one can always get rid of all other<br>acts begun at his pleasure, as is testified by both the Smritis and the<br>Srutis. Therefore, O son of Pandu, one cannot go on the world without<br>acting. One should, hence, engage in work knowing that one's purpose<br>would be achieved by a combination of both Destiny and Exertion. He that<br>engageth in acts under this belief is never pained by failure, nor<br>delighted by success. This, O Bhimasena, was the intended import of my<br>speech. It was not intended by me that victory would be certain in an<br>encounter with the foe. A person, when his mind is upset should not lose<br>his cheerfulness and must yield neither to langour nor depression. It is<br>for this that I spoke to thee in the way I did. When the morrow comes, I<br>will go, O Pandava, to Dhritarashtra's presence. I will strive to make<br>peace without sacrificing your interests. If the Kauravas make peace,<br>then boundless fame will be mine. Your purposes will be achieved, and<br>they also will reap great benefit. If, however, the Kauravas, without<br>listening to my words, resolve to maintain their opinion, then there will<br>undoubtedly be a formidable war. In this war burthen resteth on thee, O<br>Bhimasena. That burthen should also be borne by Arjuna, while other<br>warriors should all be led by both of you. In case of war happening, I<br>will certainly be the driver of Vibhatsu's car, for that, indeed, is<br>Dhananjaya's wish and not that I myself am not desirous of fighting. It<br>is for this that, hearing thee utter thy intention, I rekindled that thy<br>energy, O Vrikodara.'"
