                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'O Sanjaya, in the midst of all the princes and the<br>servants, the slayer of Madhu took Karna upon his car and went out (of<br>our city). What did that slayer of hostile heroes, that one of<br>immeasurable soul, say unto Radha's son? What conciliatory words did<br>Govinda speak unto the Suta's son? Tell me, O Sanjaya, what those words<br>were, mild or fierce, that Krishna, possessed of a voice deep as that of<br>newly-risen clouds during the rainy season said unto Karna?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Listen to me, O Bharata, as I repeat in due order those<br>words, both intimidating and mild, agreeable and consistent with virtue,<br>true and beneficial, and pleasing to the heart, which the slayer of<br>Madhu, of immeasurable soul, said unto Radha's son.'<br><br>"Vasudeva said, 'O son of Radha, thou hast worshipped many Brahmanas<br>fully conversant with the Vedas. With concentrated attention and mind<br>free from envy thou hast also (on many an occasion) enquired of them<br>after truth. Thou knowest, therefore, O Karna, what the eternal saying of<br>the Vedas are. Thou art also well-versed in all the subtle conclusions of<br>the scriptures. It is said by those conversant with the scriptures that<br>the two kinds of sons called Kanina and Sahoda that are born of a maiden,<br>have him for their father who weddeth the maid. Thou, O Karna, hast been<br>born in this way. Thou art, therefore, morally the son of Pandu. Come, be<br>a king, according to the injunction of the scriptures. On the side of thy<br>father, thou hast the sons of Pritha, on the side of thy mother, thou<br>hast the Vrishnis, (for thy kinsmen). O bull among men, know that thou<br>hast these two for thy own. Proceeding this very day with me hence, O<br>sire, let the Pandavas know thee as a son of Kunti born before<br>Yudhishthira. The brothers, the five Pandavas, the son of Draupadi, and<br>the invincible son of Subhadra, will all embrace thy feet. All the kings<br>and princes, again, that have been assembled for the Pandava-cause, and<br>all the Andhakas and Vrishnis, will also embrace thy feet. Let queens and<br>princesses bring golden and silver and earthen jars (full of water) and<br>delicious herbs and all kinds of seeds and gems, and creepers, for thy<br>installation. During the sixth period, Draupadi also will come to thee<br>(as a wife). Let that best of Brahmanas, Dhaumya, of restrained soul,<br>pour libations of clarified butter on the (sacred) fire, and let those<br>Brahmanas regarding all the four Vedas as authoritative (and who are<br>acting as priests unto the Pandavas), perform the ceremony of thy<br>installation. Let the family priest of the Pandavas who is devoted to<br>Vedic rites, and those bulls among men-those brothers, the five sons of<br>Pandu,&#8212;and the five sons of Draupadi, and the Panchalas, and the Chedis,<br>and myself also, install thee as the lord of the whole earth. Let<br>Dharma's son Yudhishthira, of righteous soul and rigid vows, be thy heir<br>presumptive, ruling the kingdom under thee. Holding the white chamara in<br>his hand (for fanning thee), let Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, ride on<br>the same car behind thee. After thy installation is over, let that other<br>son of Kunti, the mighty Bhimasena, hold the white umbrella over thy<br>head. Indeed, Arjuna then will drive thy car furnished with a hundred<br>tinkling bells, its sides covered with tiger-skins, and with white steeds<br>harnessed to it. Then Nakula and Sahadeva, and the five sons of Draupadi,<br>and the Panchalas with that mighty car-warrior Sikhandin, will all<br>proceed behind thee. I myself, with all the Andhakas and the Vrishnis,<br>will walk behind thee. Indeed, all the Dasarhas and the Dasarnas, will, O<br>king, be numbered with thy relatives. Enjoy the sovereignty of the earth,<br>O thou of mighty arms, with thy brothers the Pandavas, with yapas and<br>homas and auspicious rites of diverse kinds performed in thy honour. Let<br>the Dravidas, with the Kuntalas, the Andhras, and the Talacharas, and the<br>Shuchupas, and the Venupas, all walk before thee. Let chanters and<br>panegyrists praise thee with innumerable laudatory hymns. Let the<br>Pandavas proclaim,&#8212;Victory to Vasusena. Surrounded by the Pandavas, like<br>the moon by the stars, rule thou the kingdom, O son of Kunti, and gladden<br>Kunti herself. Let thy friends rejoice, and thy enemies grieve. Let there<br>be, this day, a brotherly union between thee and thy brothers, the sons<br>of Pandu."
