                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Having despatched the priest to the city called<br>after the elephant they sent messengers to the kings of various<br>countries. And having sent messengers to other places, the Kuru hero<br>Dhananjaya, that bull among men and son of Kunti, himself set out for<br>Dwaraka. And after Krishna and Valadeva, the descendants of Madhu, had<br>both departed for Dwaraka with all the Vrishnis, the Andhakas and the<br>Bhojas, by hundreds, the royal son of Dhritarashtra had, by sending<br>secret emissaries, furnished himself with information of all the doings<br>of the Pandavas. And learning that Krishna was on his way, the prince<br>went to the city of Dwaraka by means of fine horses possessing the speed<br>of the wind, and taking with him a small number of troops. And on that<br>very day the son of Kunti and Pandu, Dhananjaya, also speedily arrived at<br>the beautiful city of the Anarta land. And the two scions of the Kuru<br>race, those tigers among men, on arriving there saw that Krishna was<br>asleep, and drew near him as he lay down. And as Krishna was sleeping,<br>Duryodhana entered the room, and sat down on a fine seat at the head of<br>the bed. And after him entered that wearer of the diadem the magnanimous<br>Arjuna. And stood at the back of the bed, bowing and joining his hands.<br>And when the descendant of Vrishni, Krishna awoke, he first cast his eyes<br>on Arjuna. And having asked them as to the safety of their journey, and<br>having fitly bestowed his greetings upon them, the slayer of Madhu<br>questioned them as to the occasion of their visit. Then Duryodhana<br>addressed Krishna, with a cheerful countenance, saying, It behoveth you<br>to lend me your help in the impending war. Arjuna and myself are both<br>equally your friends. And, O descendant of Madhu, you also bear the same<br>relationship to both of us. And today, O slayer of Madhu, I have been the<br>first to come to you. Right-minded persons take up the cause of him who<br>comes first to them. This is how the ancients acted. And, O Krishna, you<br>stand at the very top of all right-minded persons in the world, and are<br>always respected. I ask you to follow the rule of conduct observed by<br>rightminded men.' Thereat Krishna replied, 'That you have come first, O<br>king, I do not in the least doubt. But, O king, the son of Kunti,<br>Dhananjaya, has been first beheld by me. On account of your first<br>arrival, and on account of my having beheld Arjuna first, I shall, no<br>doubt, lend my assistance, O Suyodhana, to both. But it is said that<br>those who are junior in years should have the first choice. Therefore,<br>Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, is entitled to first choice. There is a<br>large body of cowherds numbering ten crores, rivalling me in strength and<br>known as the Narayanas, all of whom are able to fight in the thick of<br>battle. These soldiers, irresistible in battle, shall be sent to one of<br>you and I alone, resolved not to fight on the field, and laying down my<br>arms, will go to the other. You may, O son of Kunti, first select<br>whichever of these two commends itself to you. For, according to law, you<br>have the right to the first choice.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by Krishna, Dhananjaya the son<br>of Kunti selected Kesava who was not to fight on the battle-field, even<br>Narayana himself, the slayer of foes, increate, born among men at his own<br>will,&#8212;the foremost of all Kshatriyas and above all the gods and the<br>Danavas. And Duryodhana selected for himself that entire army (composed<br>of the Narayanas). And, O descendant of Bharata, having obtained those<br>troops numbering thousands upon thousands, he was exceedingly delighted,<br>although he knew that Krishna was not on his side. And having secured<br>that army possessed of terrible prowess, Duryodhana went to the son of<br>Rohini of great strength, and explained to him, the object of his visit.<br>The descendant of Sura in reply addressed the following words to<br>Dhritarashtra's son, 'Thou shouldst remember, O tiger among men, all that<br>I said at the marriage ceremony celebrated by Vitrata. O thou delighter<br>of the race of Kuru, for thy sake I then contradicted Krishna and spoke<br>against his opinions. And again and again I alluded to the equality of<br>our relationship to both the parties. But Krishna did not adopt the views<br>I then expressed; nor can I separate myself from Krishna for even a<br>single moment. And seeing that I cannot act against Krishna even this is<br>resolution formed by me, viz., that I will fight neither for Kunti's sons<br>nor for you. And, O bull of the Bharatas, born as thou art in Bharata's<br>race that is honoured by all the kings, go and fight in accordance with<br>the rules of propriety.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed, Duryodhana embraced that hero<br>wielding a plough for his weapon of battle, and although knowing that<br>Krishna had been taken away from his side, he yet regarded Arjuna as<br>already vanquished. And the royal son of Dhritarashtra then went to<br>Kritavarman. And Kritavarman gave him a body of troops numbering an<br>Akshauhini. And surrounded by that military host, terrible to behold, the<br>Kaurava marched forth delighting his friends. And after Duryodhana had<br>departed, Krishna, the Creator of the world, clad in yellow attire,<br>addressed Kiritin, saying, 'For what reason is it that you have selected<br>me who will not fight at all?'<br><br>"Thereupon Arjuna answered, 'I question not that you are able to slay<br>them all. I also am alone capable of slaying them, O best of men. But you<br>are an illustrious person in the world; and this renown will accompany<br>you. I also am a suitor for fame; therefore, you have been selected by<br>me. It hath been always my desire to have you for driving my car. I,<br>therefore, ask you to fulfil my desire cherished for a long time.'<br><br>"Vasudeva's son thereupon said, It beseems thee well, O Kunti's son, that<br>thou measurest thyself with me. I will act as thy charioteer; let thy<br>wish be fulfilled.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then with a glad heart, Kunti's son,<br>accompanied by Krishna as well as by the flower of the Dasarha race, came<br>back to Yudhishthira.'
