                            "Sanjaya said, 'O monarch, provoking Arjuna still further who was like a<br>snake of virulent poison, by means of those wordy strokes of his Uluka<br>once more repeated the words he had once spoken. The Pandavas had before<br>such repetition, been sufficiently provoked, but hearing these words (a<br>second time) and receiving those censures through the gambler's son, they<br>were provoked beyond endurance. They all stood up, and began to stretch<br>their arms. And looking like enraged snakes of virulent poison, they<br>began to cast their eyes on one another. And Bhimasena, with face<br>downwards, and breathing heavily like a snake, began to glance obliquely<br>at Kesava, directing the blood-red corners of his eyes towards him. And<br>beholding the Wind-god's son to be greatly afflicted and extremely<br>provoked with rage, he of Dasarha's race smilingly addressed the<br>gambler's son and said, 'Depart hence without a moment's delay. O<br>gambler's son, and say unto Suyodhana these words, viz.,&#8212;Thy words have<br>been heard and sense understood. Let that take place which  thou<br>desirest.' Having said this, O best of monarchs, the mighty-armed Kesava<br>looked once more at Yudhishthira endued with great wisdom. Then in the<br>midst and presence of all the Srinjayas, of Krishna possessed of great<br>fame, of Drupada with his sons, of Virata, and all the kings (there<br>assembled), Uluka once more repeated unto Arjuna the words he had said,<br>provoking him still further thereby, like one annoying wrathful snake of<br>virulent poison by means of a stake. And he also said unto all of them,<br>viz.,&#8212;Krishna and others, those words that Duryodhana had instructed him<br>to say. And hearing those harsh and highly disagreeable words uttered by<br>Uluka, Partha was greatly excited and wiped the sweat off his forehead.<br>And beholding Partha, O king, in that condition, that assembly of<br>monarchs could not bear it at all. And at that insult to Krishna and the<br>high-souled Partha, the car-warriors of the Pandavas were greatly<br>agitated. Though endued with great steadiness of mind, those tigers among<br>men began to burn with anger. And Dhrishtadyumna and Sikhandin and that<br>mighty car-warrior, Satyaki, and the five Kekaya brothers, and the<br>Rakshasa Ghatotkacha, the sons of Draupadi, and Abhimanyu, and king<br>Dhrishtaketu, and Bhimasena, endued with great prowess, and those mighty<br>car-warriors&#8212;the twins,&#8212;jumped up from their seats, their eyes red with<br>anger, tossing their handsome arms decked with red sandal-paste and<br>ornaments of gold. Then Vrikodara, the son of Kunti, understanding their<br>gestures and hearts, sprang up from his seat. And gnashing his teeth, and<br>licking with his tongue the corners of his mouth, and burning with rage,<br>and squeezing his hands and turning his eyes fiercely, said these words<br>unto Uluka, Ignorant fool, thy words have now been heard which Duryodhana<br>said unto thee for the object of provoking us as if we were a set of<br>imbeciles! Hear now the words which I say and which thou art to repeat<br>unto the inaccessible Suyodhana in the midst of all the Kshatriyas and in<br>the hearing of the Suta's son and the wicked-hearted Sakuni. We always<br>seek to gratify our elder brother! It was for this, O thou of wicked<br>behaviour, that we tolerated thy acts. Dost thou not regard this as<br>highly fortunate for thee? It was for only the good of our race that king<br>Yudhishthira the Just, endued with great intelligence, sent Hrishikesa to<br>the Kurus for bringing about a peace! Impelled by Fate, without doubt,<br>thou art desirous of repairing unto Yama's abode! Come, fight with us.<br>That, however, is certainly to take place tomorrow! I have, indeed, vowed<br>to slay thee with thy brothers! O sinful fool, do not entertain the<br>slightest doubt, for it will be as I have vowed! The very ocean, the<br>abode of Varuna-may all on a sudden transgress its continents. The very<br>mountains may split, yet my words can never be false! If Yama himself, or<br>Kuvera, or Rudra, assisteth thee, the Pandavas will still accomplish what<br>they have vowed! I shall certainly drink Dussasana's blood according to<br>my pleasure! And I also vow that Kshatriya whatsoever may then angrily<br>approach me, even if he cometh with Bhishma himself at the van, I will<br>send him to Yama's abode! That which I have said in the midst of a<br>Kshatriya assembly will certainly be true. I swear this by my soul!<br><br>'Hearing these words of Bhimasena, the wrathful Sahadeva also, with eyes<br>red in anger, said these words in the presence of the (assembled)<br>troops,&#8212;words that become that proud hero. And he said, 'Listen, O<br>sinful one, to the words I utter and which must be repeated to thy<br>father! A difference would never have arisen between us and the Kurus, if<br>Dhritarashtra had no relationship with thee! Of sinful acts and the<br>exterminator of thy own race, thou hast been born as an embodiment of<br>quarrel for the destruction of the whole world as also for the<br>destruction of Dhritarashtra's race! From our very birth, O Uluka, that<br>sinful father of thine hath always sought to do us injury and evil. I<br>desire to attain the opposite shore of that hostile relation. Slaying<br>thee first before the very eyes of Sakuni, I shall then slay Sakuni<br>himself in the sight of all bowmen!'<br><br>'Hearing these words of both Bhima and Sahadeva, Falguni smilingly<br>addressed Bhima, saying, 'O Bhimasena, they that have provoked<br>hostilities with thee, cannot live! Though they may dwell happily in<br>their homes, those fools become yet entangled in the meshes of death! O<br>best of men, Uluka doth not deserve to be addressed harshly by thee! What<br>fault do envoys commit, repeating as they only do what they are<br>instructed (to say)?' And having thus addressed Bhima of terrible prowess<br>that mighty-armed hero then addressed his heroic allies and well-wishers<br>headed by Dhrishtadyumna, saying, 'Ye have heard the words of the sinful<br>son of Dhritarashtra in dispraise of Vasudeva and especially of myself!<br>And hearing them ye have been filled with anger because ye wish us well!<br>But through Vasudeva's might and your endeavours, I do not reckon even<br>all the Kshatriyas of the earth assembled together! With your permission<br>I will now communicate to Uluka what the reply to those words is, what,<br>indeed, he should say unto Duryodhana!&#8212;When the morrow cometh, stationed<br>at the head of my division, the answer to these words shall I give<br>through Gandiva! For they that are eunuchs, answer in words!'<br><br>'Hearing this, all those best of kings applauded Dhananjaya, wondering at<br>the ingenuity of that reply. King Yudhishthira the Just, then, having<br>spoken mildly unto all the kings each according to his age and as each<br>deserved said, at last, unto Uluka these words so that he might carry<br>them to Duryodhana. And Yudhishthira said, 'No good king should patiently<br>bear an insult. Having so long heard what thou hadst to say, I shall now<br>tell thee what my reply is!'<br><br>'Having heard then, O best of Bharata's race, those words of Duryodhana,<br>Yudhishthira, that bull of the Bharata race, with eyes exceedingly red in<br>anger and himself sighing like a snake of virulent poison, licking the<br>corners of his mouth with his tongue, as if swelling with wrath, and<br>casting his eyes on Janardana and his own brothers, said unto Uluka these<br>words that were fraught with both mildness and vigour. And tossing his<br>massive arms he said unto the gambler's son, 'Go, O Uluka, and say unto<br>Duryodhana, that ungrateful, wicked-minded embodiment of hostilities,<br>that infamous wretch of his race, these words, viz.,&#8212;O sinful wretch,<br>thou always behavest with crookedness towards the Pandavas! O sinful<br>fool, he that displayeth his prowess relying on his own might and<br>summoneth his foes (to battle) and fulfilleth his own words, even he is a<br>man of the Kshatriya order! Be thou a Kshatriya, O sinful wretch, and<br>summon us to battle! O infamous one of thy race, do not come to battle,<br>placing at thy head others for whom we profess respect! O Kaurava,<br>relying on thy own might and on that of thy servants, summon the sons of<br>Pritha to battle! Be Kshatriya in every way! He, who summoneth his foes,<br>relying on the might of others, and incapable of receiving them himself<br>is, indeed, a eunuch! Thou, however, thinkest highly of thyself, relying<br>on the might of others! Being weak and unable thyself, why then dost thou<br>roar so (in words) at us?'<br><br>"Krishna said, 'My words also, O gambler's son, should be communicated<br>unto Suyodhana. Let that morrow come to thee on which the battle is to<br>take place. O thou of wicked soul, be a man! O fool, thou thinkest<br>Janardana will not fight, since he hath been chosen by the Pandavas to<br>act only as a charioteer, so thou art not alarmed. That, however, will<br>not be, even for a moment. If my wrath is excited, I may then consume all<br>the kings (assembled by thee) like a fire consuming a heap of straw. At<br>Yudhishthira's command, however, I shall only discharge the functions of<br>charioteer to the high-souled Falguni, of senses under complete control<br>and who alone, (amongst us two) will fight! If thou fliest beyond the<br>limits of the three worlds, if thou sinkest into the depths of the earth,<br>thou shalt, even at these places, behold Arjuna's car tomorrow morning.<br>Thou thinkest that Bhima's words have been spoken in vain! But know that<br>Dussasana's blood hath already been quaffed. Know this also that although<br>thou hast uttered such cross and perverse words, yet neither Partha, nor<br>king Yudhishthira, nor Bhimasena, nor any of the twins, regardeth thee as<br>straw!'"
