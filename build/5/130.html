                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Disregarding these words of grave import, spoken by<br>his mother, Duryodhana went away, in anger, from that place to the<br>presence of wicked persons. And wending away from the court, the Kuru<br>prince began to consult with Suvala's royal son, Sakuni, most clever in<br>dice. And this was the resolution which Duryodhana and Karna and Suvala's<br>son Sakuni, with Dussasana as their fourth, arrived at, 'This Janardana,<br>quick in action, seeketh, with the king Dhritarashtra and Santanu's son,<br>to seize us first. We, however, shall forcibly seize this tiger among<br>men, Hrishikesa, first, like Indra forcibly seizing Virochana's son<br>(Vali). Hearing that this one of Vrishni's race hath been seized, the<br>Pandavas will lose their heart and become incapable of exertion, like<br>snakes whose fangs have been broken. This mighty-armed one is, indeed,<br>the refuge and protection of them all. If this grantor of wishes, this<br>bull of all the Satwatas, be confined, the Pandavas with the Somakas will<br>become depressed and incapable of any exertion. Therefore, disregarding<br>Dhritarashtra's cries, we will seize even here this Kesava, who is quick<br>in action, and then fight with the foe.' After those sinful men of wicked<br>souls had come to this sinful resolution, highly intelligent Satyaki,<br>capable of reading the heart by signs, soon came to know of it. And<br>because of that knowledge, he soon issued out of the court, accompanied<br>by Hridika's son (Kritavarman). And Satyaki addressed Kritavarman,<br>saying, 'Array the troops soon. And accoutred in mail and with thy troops<br>arrayed for battle, wait thou at the entrance of the court, till I<br>represent this matter unto Krishna, unwearied by exertion.' Saying this,<br>that hero re-entered the court, like a lion entering a mountain-cave. And<br>he (first) informed the high-souled Kesava and then Dhritarashtra, and<br>then Vidura of that conspiracy. And having informed them of that<br>resolution, he laughingly said, 'These wicked men intended to commit an<br>act here, that is disapproved by the good from consideration of virtue,<br>profit, and desire. They will, however, never be able to actually achieve<br>it. These fools of sinful souls assembled together, these wretches<br>overwhelmed by lust, anger and yielding themselves up to wrath and<br>covetousness, are about to perpetrate a highly unbecoming deed. Those<br>wretches of little understanding and desirous of seizing the lotus-eyed,<br>are like idiots and children desiring to seize a blazing fire by means of<br>their garments.' Hearing these words of Satyaki, Vidura, endued with<br>great foresight, said these words unto the mighty-armed Dhritarashtra in<br>the midst of the Kurus, 'O king, O chastiser of foes, the hour of all thy<br>sons is come, for they are endeavouring to perpetrate a highly infamous<br>act, however incapable they may be of actually accomplishing it. Alas,<br>united together they desire to vanquish this younger brother of Vasava,<br>and seize this lotus-eyed one. Indeed, encountering this tiger among men,<br>this invincible and irresistible one, they will all perish like insects<br>in a blazing fire. If Janardana wisheth, he can send all of them, even if<br>they fight in a body, unto the abode of Yama, like an enraged lion<br>dispatching a herd of elephants. He will, however, never do any such<br>sinful and censurable act. This best of persons, of unfading glory, will<br>never deviate from virtue.' After Vidura had said these words, Kesava,<br>casting his eyes on Dhritarashtra, said in the midst of those<br>well-meaning persons, who listen to others' words, 'O king, if these<br>(men) desire to chastise me by using violence, permit them to chastise<br>me. O monarch, as regards my chastising them, for I dare chastise all of<br>them together that are so excited with rage, I will not, however,<br>perpetrate any sinful and censurable act. Coveting the possessions of the<br>Pandavas, thy sons will lose their own. If they desire to perpetrate such<br>a deed, Yudhishthira's object will then be (easily) accomplished, for,<br>this very day, O Bharata, seizing these with all that follow them, I can<br>make them over to the sons of Pritha. What is there that is difficult of<br>attainment by me? I will not, however, O Bharata, commit in thy presence,<br>O great monarch, any such censurable deed, that can proceed only from<br>wrath and a sinful understanding. Let it be, O king, as this Duryodhana<br>desireth. I give permission, O monarch, to all thy sons to do it.'<br><br>"Hearing these words (of Kesava), Dhritarashtra addressed Vidura saying,<br>'Quickly bring hither sinful Duryodhana, who is so covetous of<br>sovereignty, with his friends, counsellors, brothers, and followers. I<br>shall see if indeed, making one more effort I can bring him to the right<br>path.<br><br>'Thus addressed by Dhritarashtra, Kshattri once more caused unwilling<br>Duryodhana to enter the court with his brothers, and surrounded by the<br>kings (that followed him). King Dhritarashtra then addressed Duryodhana,<br>surrounded by Karna and Dussasana and all those kings, saying, 'O wretch<br>of accumulated sins, having for thy allies men of despicable acts,<br>infamous is the deed that thou, uniting with sinful friends, seekest to<br>do. Of little understanding, thou, infamy of thy race, one like thee<br>alone can seek to do an act so infamous and disapproved by the good,<br>however impossible it may be of being actually achieved. Uniting with<br>sinful allies, wishest thou to chastise this invincible and irresistible<br>one of eyes like lotus-leaves? Like a child wishing to have the moon,<br>seekest thou, O fool, to do what cannot be done by the very gods, headed<br>by Vasava with all their strength? Knowest thou not, that Kesava is<br>incapable of being withstood in battle by gods and men and Gandharvas and<br>Asuras and Uragas? Like the wind which none can seize of being seized<br>with his hands, like the moon which no hand can reach, like the Earth<br>which none can support on his head, Kesava is incapable by force.'<br><br>"After Dhritarashtra had said these words, Vidura (casting) his eyes on<br>Duryodhana, addressed that vindictive son of Dhritarashtra, saying, 'O<br>Duryodhana, listen now to these words of mine. At the gates of Saubha,<br>that foremost of monkeys, known by the name of Dwivida, covered Kesava<br>with a mighty shower of stones. Desirous of seizing Madhava by putting<br>forth all his prowess and exertion, he did not yet succeed in seizing<br>him. Seekest thou to apprehend that Kesava by force? When Sauri went to<br>Pragjyotisha, Naraka with all the Danavas succeeded not in seizing him<br>there. Seekest thou to seize him by force? Slaying that Naraka in battle,<br>he brought away (from his city) a thousand damsels and married them all,<br>according to the ordinance. In the city of Nirmochana, six thousand<br>mighty Asuras failed to seize him with their nooses. Seekest thou to<br>seize that Kesava by force? While only a child, he slew Putana and two<br>Asuras assuming the shape of birds, and O bull of Bharata's race, he held<br>up the mountains of Govardhana (on his little finger) for protecting the<br>kine (from a continuous rain). He hath also slain Aristha, and Dhenuka<br>and Chanura of great strength, and Aswaraja, and Kansa, the doer of evil.<br>He hath slain Jarasandha, and Vakra, and Sisupala of mighty energy, and<br>Vana in battle, and numerous other kings also have been slain by him. Of<br>immeasurable might, he vanquished king Varuna and also Pavaka (Agni), and<br>on the occasion of bringing (down from the celestial regions) the<br>(heavenly flower called) Parijata, he defeated the lord of Sachi himself.<br>While floating on the vast deep, he slew Madhu and Kaitabha, and in<br>another birth he slew Hayagriva (Horse-necked). He is the maker of<br>everything but is himself made by none. He is the Cause of all power.<br>Whatever Sauri wisheth, he accomplisheth without any effort. Knowest thou<br>not sinless Govinda, of terrible prowess and incapable of deterioration?<br>This one, resembling an angry snake of virulent poison, is the<br>never-ending source of energy. In seeking to use violence towards<br>Krishna, endued with mighty arms and unwearied by exertion, thou wilt,<br>with all thy followers, perish like an insect failing into fire.'"
