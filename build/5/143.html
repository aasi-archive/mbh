                            "Sanjaya said, 'Hearing these beneficial and auspicious words of Kesava,<br>Karna worshipped Krishna, the slayer of Madhu, and said these words,<br>'Knowing (everything), why dost thou yet, O thou of mighty arms, seek to<br>beguile me? The destruction of the whole earth that is at hand for its<br>cause, Sakuni, and myself, and Dussasana, and king Duryodhana, the son of<br>Dhritarashtra. Without doubt, O Krishna, a great and fierce battle is at<br>hand between the Pandavas and the Kurus which will cover the earth with<br>bloody mire. All the kings and princes following the lead of Duryodhana,<br>consumed by the fire of weapons will proceed to the abode of Yama.<br>Diverse frightful visions are seen, O slayer of Madhu, and many terrible<br>portents, and fierce disturbances also. All these omens, making the hairs<br>(of the spectators) stand on their ends, indicate, O thou of Vrishni's<br>race, the defeat of Dhritarashtra's son and the victory of Yudhishthira.<br>That fierce planet of great effulgence, Sanaischara (Saturn), is<br>afflicting the constellation called Rohini, in order to afflict greatly<br>the creatures of the earth. The planet Angaraka (Mars), wheeling, O<br>slayer of Madhu, towards the constellation Jeshthya, approacheth towards<br>Anuradhas, indicating a great slaughter of friends. Without doubt, O<br>Krishna, a terrible calamity approacheth the Kurus when specially, O thou<br>of Vrishni's race, the planet Mahapat afflicteth the constellation<br>Chitra. The spot on the lunar disc hath changed its position; and Rahu<br>also approacheth towards the sun. Meteors are falling from the sky with<br>loud noise and trembling motion. The elephants are sending forth<br>frightful cries, while the steeds, O Madhava, are shedding tears, without<br>taking any delight in food and drink. They say, O thou of mighty arms,<br>that on the appearance of these portents, a terrible calamity<br>approacheth, productive of a great slaughter. O Kesava, amongst the<br>steeds, elephants and soldiers, in all the divisions of Duryodhana's<br>army, it is seen, O slayer of Madhu, that while small is the food these<br>take, ample is the excreta they evacuate. The wise have said that this is<br>an indication of defect. The elephants and steeds of the Pandavas, O<br>Krishna, all seem to be cheerful, while all the animals wheel along their<br>right. This also is an indication of their success. The same animal, O<br>Kesava, pass by the left side of Duryodhana's army, while incorporeal<br>voices are constantly heard (over their heads). All this is an indication<br>of defeat. All auspicious birds, such as peacocks, swans, cranes,<br>Chatakas, Jivajivas, and large flights of Vakas, follow the Pandavas,<br>while vultures, Kankas, hawks, Rakshasas, wolves and bees, in flights and<br>herds, follow the Kauravas. The drums in the army of Dhritarashtra's son<br>yield no sounds, while those of the Pandavas yield sounds without being<br>struck. The wells in the midst of Duryodhana's encampment send forth loud<br>roars like those of huge bulls. All this is an indication of defeat. The<br>gods are showering flesh and blood, O Madhava, on Duryodhana's soldiers.<br>Vapoury edifices of great effulgence with high walls, deep trenches, and<br>handsome porches, are suddenly appearing in the skies (over the Kuru<br>encampment). A black circle surrounding the solar disc appears to the<br>view. Both twilights at sunrise and sunset indicate great terrors. The<br>jackals yell hideously. All this is an indication of defeat. Diverse<br>birds, each having but one wing, one eye, and one leg, utter terrible<br>cries. All this, O slayer of Madhu, indicates defeat. Fierce birds with<br>black wings and red legs hover over the Kuru encampment at nightfall. All<br>this is an indication of defeat. The soldiers of Duryodhana betray hatred<br>for Brahmanas first, and then for their preceptors, and then for all<br>their affectionate servants. The, eastern horizon of (Duryodhana's<br>encampment) appeareth red; the southern of the hue of weapons; and<br>western, O slayer of Madhu, of an earthy hue. All the quarters around<br>Duryodhana's encampment seem, O Madhava, to be ablaze. In the appearance<br>of all these portents, great is the danger that is indicated.<br><br>'I have in a vision, O Achyuta, beheld Yudhishthira ascending with his<br>brothers a palace supported by a thousand columns. All of them appeared<br>with white head-gears and in white robes. And all of them appeared to me<br>to be seated on white seats. In the midst of the same vision, thou, O<br>Janardana, wast beheld by me to be employed in enveloping the blood-dyed<br>earth with weapons. Yudhishthira at the same time, of immeasurable<br>energy, ascending upon a heap of bones, was gladly eating buttered payasa<br>of a golden cup. I further beheld Yudhishthira to be employed in<br>swallowing the earth handed over to him by thee. This indicates that he<br>will verily rule the earth I beheld that tiger among men, Vrikodara, of<br>fierce deeds, standing on the summit, mace in hand, and as if devouring<br>this earth. This plainly indicates that he will slay all of us in fierce<br>battle. It is known to me, O lord of the senses, that victory is there<br>where righteousness is. I saw also Dhananjaya, the wielder of Gandiva,<br>seated on the back of a white elephant, with thee, O lord of the senses,<br>and blazing forth with great beauty. I have no doubt, O Krishna, that ye<br>will slay in battle all the kings headed by Duryodhana. I saw Nakula and<br>Sahadeva and that mighty car-warrior Satyaki, adorned with white<br>bracelets, white cuirasses, white garlands, and white robes. This tiger<br>among men were seated upon excellent vehicles borne on the shoulders of<br>men. And I saw that umbrellas were held over the heads of all the three.<br>Amongst the soldiers of Dhritarashtra's son, these three, O Janardana,<br>were beheld by me decked with white head-gears. Know, O Kesava, that<br>those three were Aswatthaman, Kripa, and Kritavarman of Satwata's race.<br>All other kings, O Madhava, were seen by me to have blood-red head-ears.<br>I saw also, O thou of mighty arms, that those mighty car-warriors Bhishma<br>and Drona, ascending on a vehicle drawn by camels, and by myself, and<br>Dhritarashtra's son, proceeded, O lord, to the quarter, O Janardana,<br>ruled by Agastya. This indicates that we shall soon have to proceed to<br>Yama's abode. I have no doubt that myself and the other kings, indeed,<br>the entire assemblage of Kshatriyas shall have to enter into the Gandiva<br>fire.'<br><br>"Krishna said, 'Indeed, the destruction of the earth is at hand when my<br>words, O Karna, do not become acceptable to thy heart. O sire, when the<br>destruction of all creatures approacheth, wrong assuming the semblance of<br>right leaveth not the heart.'<br><br>"Karna said, 'If, O Krishna, we come out of this great battle that will<br>be so destructive of heroic Kshatriyas, with life, then, O thou of mighty<br>arms may we meet here again. Otherwise, O Krishna, we shall certainly<br>meet in heaven. O sinless one, it seemeth to me now that there only it is<br>possible for us to meet.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Having spoken these words, Karna closely pressed Madhava<br>to his bosom. Dismissed by Kesava, he then descended from the car. And<br>riding on his own car decked with gold, Radha's son greatly dejected,<br>came back with us!'"
