                            (Bhagwat Yana Parva)<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'When good Sanjaya (leaving the Pandava camp) went back<br>to the Kurus, what did my grandsires, the sons of Pandu, then do? O<br>foremost of Brahmanas, I desire to hear all this. Tell me this,<br>therefore.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'After Sanjaya had gone, Yudhishthira the just,<br>addressed Krishna of the Dasarha race&#8212;that chief of all the Sattwatas,<br>saying, 'O thou that art devoted to friends, the time hath come for<br>friends to show their friendship. I do not see any other persons besides<br>thee that can save us in this season of distress. Relying on thee, O<br>Madhava, we have fearlessly asked back our share from Duryodhana who is<br>filled with immeasurable pride and from his counsellors. O chastiser of<br>foes, thou protectest the Vrishnis in all their calamities, do thou now<br>protect the Pandavas also from a great danger, for they deserve thy<br>protection.'<br><br>"Divine Krishna said, 'Here am I O mighty-armed one. Tell me what thou<br>desirest to say, for I will, O Bharata, accomplish whatever thou wilt<br>tell me.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast heard what the intention is of<br>Dhritarashtra and his own. All that Sanjaya, O Krishna, said unto me hath<br>certainly the assent of Dhritarashtra. Sanjaya is Dhritarashtra's soul,<br>and spoke out his mind. An envoy speaketh according to his instructions,<br>for if he speaketh otherwise he deserveth to be slain. Without looking<br>equally on all that are his, moved by avarice and a sinful heart,<br>Dhritarashtra seeketh to make peace with us without giving us back our<br>kingdom. Indeed, at Dhritarashtra's command we spent twelve years in the<br>woods and one additional year in concealment, well-believing, O lord,<br>that Dhritarashtra would abide firmly by that pledge of ours. That we did<br>not deviate from our promise is well-known to the Brahmanas who were with<br>us. The covetous king Dhritarashtra, is now unwilling to observe<br>Kshatriya virtues. Owing to affection for his son, he is listening to the<br>counsels of wicked men. Abiding by counsels of Suyodhana, the king, O<br>Janardana, actuated by avarice and seeking his own good, behaveth<br>untruthfully towards us. What can be more sorrowful, O Janardana, than<br>this, that I am unable to maintain my mother and my friends? Having the<br>Kasis, the Panchalas, the Chedis, and the Matsyas, for my allies and with<br>thee, O slayer of Madhu, for my protector, I prayed for only five<br>villages, etc., Avishthala, Vrikasthala, Makandi, Varanavata, with any<br>other, O Govinda, as the fifth;&#8212;Grant us, we said, five villages or<br>towns, O sire, where we five may dwell in union, for we do not desire the<br>destruction of the Bharatas.&#8212;The wicked-minded son of Dhritarashtra,<br>however, regarding the lordship of the world to be; in him, doth not<br>agree to even that. What can be more sorrowful than this? When a man born<br>and brought up in a respectable family, covereth the possessions of<br>others, that avarice of his destroyeth his intelligence; and intelligence<br>being destroyed, shame is lost; and loss of shame leadeth to diminution<br>of virtue; and loss of virtue bringeth on loss of prosperity, Destruction<br>of prosperity, in its turn, ruineth a person, for poverty is a person's<br>death. Kinsmen and friends and Brahmanas shun a poor man as birds avoid,<br>O Krishna, a tree that beareth neither Rower nor fruits. Even this, O<br>sire, is death to me that kinsmen shun me, as if I were a fallen one like<br>the breath of life quitting 'a dead body. Samvara said that no condition<br>of life could be more distressful than that in which one is always racked<br>by the anxiety caused by the thought&#8212;I have no meat for today, what will<br>become of me tomorrow?&#8212;It is said that wealth is the highest virtue, and<br>everything depends on wealth. They that have wealth are said to live,<br>whereas those that are without wealth are more dead than alive. They that<br>by violence rob a man of his wealth not only kill the robbed but destroy<br>also his virtue, profit and pleasure. Some men when overtaken by poverty<br>choose death; others remove from cities to hamlets others retire into the<br>wood; while others, again, become religious mendicants to destroy their<br>lives. Some for the sake of wealth are driven to madness; others for<br>wealth, live under Subjection to their foes; while many others, again,<br>for the sake of wealth, betake themselves to the servitude of others. A<br>man's poverty is even more distressful to him than death, for wealth is<br>the sole cause or virtue and pleasure. The natural death of a person is<br>not much regarded, for that is the eternal path of all creatures. Indeed,<br>none among created beings can transgress it. O Krishna, a man who is poor<br>from birth is not so much distressed as one, who, having once possessed<br>great prosperity and having been brought up in luxury, is deprived of<br>that prosperity. Having through his own fault fallen into distress, such<br>a person blameth the very gods with Indra and his own self. Indeed,<br>knowledge of even the entire scriptures faileth to mitigate his pains.<br>Sometimes he getteth angry with his servants, and sometimes he cherisheth<br>malice towards even his well-wishers. Subject to constant anger, he<br>loseth his very senses, and his senses being clouded, be practiseth evil<br>deeds. Through sinfulness such a person contributeth to a fusion of<br>castes. A fusion of castes leadeth to hell and is the foremost of all<br>sinful acts. If he is not awakened in time, he goeth, certainly, O<br>Krishna, to hell., and, indeed, wisdom is the only thing that can awaken<br>him, for if he obtaineth back the eye of wisdom, he is saved. When wisdom<br>is regained, such a man turneth his attention to scriptures; and<br>attention to scriptures aideth his virtue. Then shame becometh his best<br>ornament. He that hath shame hath an aversion against sin, and his<br>prosperity also increaseth; and he that hath prosperity truly becometh a<br>man. He that is ever devoted to virtue, and hath his mind under control,<br>and always acteth after deliberation, never inclineth towards<br>unrighteousness and never engageth in any act that is sinful. He that is<br>without shame and sense is neither man nor woman. He is incapable of<br>earning religious merit, and is like a Sudra. He that hath shame<br>gratifieth the gods, the Pitris, and even his own self, and by this he<br>obtaineth emancipation, which indeed, is the highest aim of all righteous<br>persons.'<br><br>'Thou hast, O slayer of Madhu, seen all this in me with thy own eyes. It<br>is not unknown to thee, how, deprived of kingdom, we have lived these<br>years. We cannot lawfully abandon that prosperity (which had been ours).<br>Our first-efforts will be such that, O Madhava, both ourselves and the<br>Kauravas, united in peace, will quietly enjoy our prosperity. Otherwise,<br>we shall, after slaying the worst of the Kauravas, regain those<br>provinces, although success through bloodshed by destruction of even<br>despicable foes that are related to us so dearly is the worst of all<br>fierce deeds, O Krishna. We have numerous kinsmen, and numerous also are<br>the revered seniors that have taken this or that other side. The<br>slaughter of these would be highly sinful. What good, therefore, can<br>there be in battle? Alas, such sinful practices are the duties of the<br>Kshatriya order! Ourselves have taken our births in that wretched order!<br>Whether those practices be sinful or virtuous, any other than the<br>profession of arms would be censurable for us. A Sudra serveth; a Vaisya<br>liveth by trade; the Brahmana have choosen the wooden bowl (for begging),<br>while we are to live by slaughter! A Kshatriya, slayeth a Kshatriya;<br>fishes live on fish; a dog preyeth upon a dog! Behold, O thou of the<br>Dasarha race, how each of these followeth his peculiar virtue. O Krishna,<br>Kali is ever present in battle-fields; lives are lost all around. It is<br>true, force regulated by policy is invoked; yet success and defeat are<br>independent of the will of the combatants. The lives also of creatures<br>are independent of their own wishes, and neither weal nor woe can be<br>one's when the time is not come for it, O best of the Yadu's race.<br>Sometimes one man killeth many, sometimes many and united together kill<br>one. A coward may slay a hero, and one unknown to fame may stay a hero of<br>celebrity. Both parties cannot win success, nor both be defeated. The<br>loss, however, on both sides may be equal. If one flieth away, loss of<br>both life and fame is his. Under all circumstances, however, war is a<br>sin. Who in striking another is not himself struck? As regard the person,<br>however, who is struck, victory and defeat, O Hrishikesa, are the same.<br>It is true that defeat is not much removed from death, but his loss also,<br>O Krishna, is not less who winneth victory. He himself may not be killed,<br>but his adversaries will kill at least some one that is dear to him, or<br>some others and thus the man, O sire, deprived of strength and not seeing<br>before him his sons and brothers, becometh indifferent, O Krishna, to<br>life itself. Those that are quiet, modest, virtuous, and compassionate,<br>are generally slain in battle, while they that are wicked escape. Even<br>after slaying one's foes, repentance, O Janardana, possesseth the heart.<br>He that surviveth among the foes giveth trouble, for the survivor,<br>collecting a force, seeketh to destroy the surviving victor. In hopes of<br>terminating the dispute, one often seeketh to exterminate the foe. Thus<br>victory createth animosity, and he that is defeated liveth in sorrow. He<br>that is peaceful, sleepeth in happiness, giving up all thoughts of<br>victory and defeat, whereas he that hath provoked hostility always<br>sleepeth in misery, with, indeed, an anxious heart, as if sleeping with a<br>snake in the same room. He that exterminates seldom winneth fame. On the<br>other hand, such a person reapeth eternal infamy in the estimation of<br>all. Hostilities, waged over so long, cease not; for if there is even one<br>alive in the enemy's family, narrators are never wanted to remind him of<br>the past. Enmity, O Kesava, is never neutralised by enmity; on the other<br>hand, it is fomented by enmity, like fire fed by clarified butter.<br>Therefore, there can be no peace without the annihilation of one party,<br>for flaws may always be detected of which advantage may be taken by one<br>side or other. They that are engaged in watching for flaws have this<br>vice. Confidence in one's own prowess troubleth the core of one's heart<br>like an incurable disease. Without either renouncing that at once, or<br>death, there can be no peace. It is true, O slayer of Madhu, that<br>exterminating the foe by the very roots, may lead to good result in the<br>shape of great prosperity, yet such an act is most cruel. The peace that<br>may be brought about by our renouncing the kingdom is hardly different<br>from death, which is implied by the loss of kingdom, in consequence of<br>the design of the enemy and the utter ruin of ourselves. We do not wish<br>to give u the kingdom, nor do we wish to see the extinction of our race.<br>Under these circumstances, therefore, the peace that is obtained through<br>eve humiliation is the best. When these that strive for peace by all<br>means without of course wishing for war, find conciliation fail, war<br>becomes in evitable, and then is the time for the display of prowess.<br>Indeed, when conciliation fails, frightful results follow. The learned<br>have noticed all this in a canine contest. First, there comes the wagging<br>of tails, then the bark, then the bark in reply, then the<br>circumambulation, then the showing of teeth, then repeated roars, and<br>then at last the fight. In such a contest, O Krishna., the dog that is<br>stronger, vanquishing his antagonist, taketh the latter's meat. The same<br>is exactly the case with men. There is no difference whatever. They that<br>are powerful should be indifferent to avoid disputes with the weak who<br>always bow down. The father, the king, and he that is venerable in year,<br>always deserve regard. Dhritarashtra, therefore, O Janardana, is worthy<br>of our respect and worship. But, O Madhava, Dhritarashtra's affection for<br>his son is great. Obedient to his son, he will reject our submission.<br>What dost thou, O Krishna, think best at this juncture? How may we, O<br>Madhava, preserve both our interest and virtue? Whom also, besides thee,<br>O slayer of Madhu, and foremost of men, shall we consult in this<br>difficult affair? What other friend have we, O Krishna, who like thee is<br>so dear to us, who seeketh our welfare so, who is so conversant with the<br>course of all actions, and who is so well-acquainted with truth?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed, Janardana replied unto<br>Yudhishthira the just, saying, 'I will go to the court of the Kurus for<br>the sake of both of You. If without sacrificing your interests I can<br>obtain peace, O king, an act of great religious merit will be mine,<br>productive of great fruits. I shall then also save from the meshes of<br>death the Kurus and the Srinjayas inflamed with wrath, the Pandavas and<br>the Dhritarashtras, and, in fact, this entire earth.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, It is not my wish, O Krishna, that thou wilt go to<br>the Kurus, for Suyodhana will never act according to thy words, even if<br>thou advisest him well. All the Kshatriyas of the world, obedient to<br>Duryodhana's command, are assembled there. I do not like that thou, O<br>Krishna, shouldst proceed into their midst, If any mischief be done to<br>thee, O Madhava, Jett alone happiness; nothing, not even divinity, nor<br>even the sovereignty over all the gods will delight us.'<br><br>"The holy one said, 'I know, O monarch, the sinfulness of Dhritarashtra's<br>son, but by going there we will escape the blame of all the kings of the<br>earth. Like other animals before the lion, all the kings of the earth<br>united together are not competent to stand still before me in battle when<br>I am enraged. If, after all, they do me any injury, then I will consume<br>all the Kurus. Even this is my intention. My going thither, O Partha,<br>will not be fruitless, for if our object be not fulfilled, we shall at<br>least escape all blame.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Do, O Krishna, as it pleaseth thee. Blessed be thou,<br>go then to the Kurus. I hope to behold thee return successful and<br>prosperous. Going unto the Kurus, make thou, O Lord, such a peace that<br>all the sons of Bharata may live together with cheerful hearts and<br>contentedly. Thou art our brother and friend, dear to me as much as to<br>Vibhatsu. Such hath been our intimacy with thee that we apprehend no<br>neglect of our interest from thee. Go thou, there for our good. Thou<br>knowest us, thou knowest our antagonists, thou knowest what our purposes<br>are, and thou knowest also what to say. Thou wilt, O Krishna, say unto<br>Suyodhana such words as are for our benefit. Whether peace is to be<br>established by (apparent) sin or by any other means, O Kesava, speak such<br>words as may prove beneficial to us.'
