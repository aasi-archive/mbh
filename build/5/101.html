                            "Narada said, 'This region belongeth to the birds, all of whom possess<br>excellent feathers. They all subsist on snakes. They never feel any<br>fatigue in putting forth their prowess, or in making journeys, or in<br>bearing burthens. This race, O charioteer, hath multiplied from the six<br>sons of Garuda. They are Sumukha, Sunaman, Sunetra, Suvarchas, Suanch and<br>that prince of birds called Suvala. Born of Kasyapa's line and enhancing<br>the glory of Vinata's race, many winged creatures, the foremost of their<br>species, have by begetting children founded and increased a thousand<br>dynasties of birds, all endued with nobility of blood. All these<br>creatures are endued with great prosperity, have the auspicious whirl<br>called Sreevatsa, possess great wealth, and are inspired with great<br>might. By their acts they may be said to belong to the Kshatriya order,<br>but they are all without any compassion, subsisting as they do on snakes.<br>They never attain to spiritual enlightenment in consequence of their<br>preying on their kinsmen. I will now enumerate the chiefs by their names,<br>listen to me, O Matali. This race is much regarded in consequence of the<br>favour that, is shown to it by Vishnu. They all worship Vishnu, and<br>Vishnu is their protector. Vishnu always dwelleth in their hearts, and<br>Vishnu is their great refuge. These then are their names&#8212;Suvarnachuda,<br>Nagasin Daruna, Chandatundaka, Anala, Vaisalaksha, Kundalin, Pankajit,<br>Vajraviskambha, Vainateya, Vamana, Vatavega, Disachakshu, Nimisha,<br>Animisha, Trirava, Saptarava, Valmiki, Dipaka, Daityadwipa, Saridwipa,<br><br>Sarasa, Padmaketana, Sumukha, Chitraketu, Chitravara, Anagha, Meshahrit,<br>Kumuda, Daksha, Sarpanta, Somabhojana, Gurubhara, Kapota, Suryanetra,<br>Chirantaka, Vishnudharman, Kumara, Parivarha, Hari, Suswara, Madhuparka,<br>Hemavarna, Malaya, Matariswan, Nisakara and Divakara. These sons of<br>Garuda that I name dwell in only a single province of this region. I have<br>mentioned those only that have won distinction by might, fame and<br>achievements. If thou likest none here, come, we will go hence, O Matali.<br>I will take thee to another region where thou mayest find an eligible<br>husband for thy daughter.'"
