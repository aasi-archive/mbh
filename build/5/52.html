                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'He whom we have never heard to speak a falsehood,<br>he who hath Dhananjaya to fight for him, may have the sovereignty of even<br>the three worlds. Reflecting from day to day I do not find the warrior<br>who may, on his car, advance in battle against the wielder of Gandiva.<br>When that wielder of Gandiva will shoot winged arrows and Nalikas and<br>shafts capable of piercing the breast of warriors, there is no rival of<br>his in battle. If those bulls among men, those heroes,&#8212;Drona and<br>Karna,&#8212;those foremost of mighty men, versed in weapons and invincible in<br>battle, withstand him, the result may be very doubtful, but I am sure<br>that the victory will not be mine. Karna is both compassionate and<br>heedless, and preceptor is aged and hath affection for this pupil.<br>Partha, however, is able and mighty, of firm grasp (of the bow). Terrible<br>will be the encounter between them, without resulting in any one's<br>defeat. Conversant with weapons and endued with heroism, all of them have<br>earned great fame. They may relinquish the very sovereignty of the gods,<br>but not the chance of winning victory. There would be peace, without<br>doubt, upon the fall of either of these two (Drona and Karna) or of<br>Falguna, There is none, however, who can either slay or vanquish Arjuna.<br>Alas, how may his wrath that hath been excited against my foolish sons be<br>pacified. Others there are acquainted with the use of weapons, that<br>conqueror are conquered; but it is heard that Falguna always conquereth.<br>Three and thirty years have passed away since the time, when Arjuna,<br>having invited Agni, gratified him at Khandava, vanquishing all the<br>celestials. We have never heard of his defeat anywhere, O child. Like the<br>case of Indra, victory is always Arjuna's, who hath for his charioteer in<br>battle Hrishikesa, endued with the same character and position. We hear<br>that the two Krishnas on the same car and the stringed Gandiva,&#8212;these<br>three forces,&#8212;have been united together. As regards ourselves, we have<br>not a bow of that kind, or a warrior like Arjuna, or a charioteer like<br>Krishna. The foolish followers of Duryodhana are not aware of this. O<br>Sanjaya, the blazing thunderbolt falling on the head leaveth something<br>undestroyed, but the arrows, O child, shot by Kiritin leave nothing<br>undestroyed. Even now I behold Dhanajaya shooting his arrows and<br>committing a havoc around, picking off heads from bodies with his arrowy<br>showers! Even now I behold the arrowy conflagration, blazing all around,<br>issuing from the Gandiva, consuming in battle the ranks of my sons. Even<br>now it seemeth to me that, struck with panic at the rattle of<br>Savyasachin's car, my vast army consisting of diverse forces is running<br>away in all directions. As a tremendous conflagration, wandering in all<br>directions, of swelling flames and urged by the wind, consumeth dry<br>leaves and grass, so will the great fame of Arjuna's weapons consume all<br>my troops. Kiritin, appearing as a foe in battle, will vomit innumerable<br>arrows and become irresistible like all destroying Death urged forward by<br>the Supreme Ordainer. When I shall constantly hear of evil omens of<br>diverse kinds happening in the homes of the Kurus. and around them and on<br>the field of battle, then will destruction, without doubt, overtake the<br>Bharats.'"
