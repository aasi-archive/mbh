                            "Duryodhana said, 'All that Vidura hath said about Krishna, hath indeed,<br>been truly said; for Janardana is greatly devoted to the Pandavas and can<br>never be separated from them. All the diverse kinds of wealth, O foremost<br>of kings, that are proposed to be bestowed upon Janardana ought never to<br>be bestowed upon him. Kesava is, of course, not unworthy of our worship,<br>but both time and place are against it, for he (Krishna), O king, on<br>receiving our worship, will very likely think that we are worshipping him<br>out of fear. This is my certain conviction, O king, that an intelligent<br>Kshatriya must not do that which may bring disgrace upon him. It is<br>well-known to me that the large-eyed Krishna deserveth the most<br>reverential worship of the three worlds. It is quite out of place,<br>therefore, O illustrious king, to give him anything now, for war having<br>been decided upon, it should never be put off by hospitality.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana. continued, 'Hearing these words of his, the Grandsire of<br>the Kurus spoke these words unto the royal son of Vichitravirya,<br>'Worshipped or not worshipped, Janardana never becometh angry. None,<br>however, can treat him with disrespect, for Kesava is not contemptible.<br>Whatever, O mighty one, he purposeth to do is incapable of being<br>frustrated by anybody by every means in his power. Do without hesitation<br>what Krishna of mighty arms sayeth and bring about peace with the<br>Pandavas through Vasudeva as the means. Truly Janardana, possessed of<br>virtuous soul, will say what is consistent with religion and profit. It<br>behoveth thee, therefore, with all thy friends, to tell him what only is<br>agreeable to him.'<br><br>"Duryodhana said, 'O Grandsire, I can, by no means, live by sharing this<br>swelling prosperity of mine with the Pandavas. Listen, this, indeed, is a<br>great resolution which I have formed. I will imprison Janardana who is<br>the refuge of the Pandavas. He will come here tomorrow morning; and when<br>he is confined, the Vrishnis and the Pandavas, aye, the whole earth, will<br>submit to me. What may be the means for accomplishing it, so that<br>Janardana may not guess our purpose, and so that no danger also may<br>overtake us, it behoveth thee to say.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these fearful words of his son about<br>imprisoning Krishna, Dhritarashtra, with all his counsellors, was very<br>much pained and became deeply afflicted. King Dhritarashtra then spoke<br>those words unto Duryodhana, 'O ruler of men, never say this again, this<br>is not immemorial custom. Hrishikesa cometh here as an ambassador. He is,<br>besides, related to and is dear to us. He hath done us no wrong; how then<br>doth he deserves imprisonment?'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'This wicked son of thine, O Dhritarashtra, hath his hour<br>come. He chooseth evil, not good, though entreated by his well-' wishers.<br>Thou also followest in the wake of this wicked wretch of sinful<br>surroundings, who treadeth a thorny path setting at naught the words of<br>his well-wisher. This exceedingly wicked son of thine with all his<br>counsellors coming in contact with Krishna of unstained acts, will be<br>destroyed in a moment. I dare not listen to the words of this sinful and<br>wicked wretch that hath abandoned all virtue.'<br><br>'Having said this, that aged chief of the Bharata race, Bhishma of<br>unbaffled prowess, inflamed with rage rose and left that place.'"
