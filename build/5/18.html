                            "Salya said, "Then Indra, glorified by the bands of Gandharvas and<br>celestial nymphs, mounted on Airavata, the king of elephants,<br>characterised by auspicious marks. And the illustrious Agni, and the<br>great saint Vrihaspati, and Yama, and Varuna, and Kuvera, the lord of<br>riches, accompanied him. And the lord Sakra, the slayer of Vritra, then<br>went to the three worlds surrounded by the gods together with the<br>Gandharvas and the celestial nymphs. And the performer of a hundred<br>sacrifices, the king of the deities, was thus united with his queen. And<br>he began to protect the worlds with exceeding gladness. Then the<br>illustrious divine saint Angiras arrived in the assembly of Indra and<br>worshipped him duly by reciting the hymns of the Atharva. And the great<br>lord Indra became satisfied and granted a boon to the Atharvangiras. And<br>Indra said, 'Thou wilt be known as a Rishi of the name Atharvangiras in<br>the Atharva Veda, and thou wilt also get a share in sacrifices.' And<br>having honoured Atharvangiras thus, the great lord Indra, the performer<br>of a hundred sacrifices, parted with him, O great king. And he honoured<br>all the deities and all the saints endued with wealth of asceticism. And,<br>O king, Indra, well-pleased, governed the people virtuously. Thus was<br>misery endured by Indra with his wife. And with the view of slaying his<br>foes, even he had to pass a period in concealment. Thou shouldst not take<br>it to heart that thou, O king of kings, hast suffered with Draupadi as<br>also with thy high-minded brothers in the great forest. O king of kings,<br>O descendant of Bharata, O delighter of Kuru's race, thou wilt get back<br>thy kingdom in the same way as Indra got his, after having killed Vritra.<br>The vicious Nahusha, that enemy of Brahmanas, of evil mind, was<br>overthrown by the curse of Agastya, and reduced to nothing for endless<br>years. Similarly, O slayer of foes, thy enemies, Karna and Duryodhana and<br>others of vicious souls will quickly be destroyed. Then, O hero, thou<br>wilt enjoy the whole of this earth, as far as the sea, with thy brothers<br>and this Draupadi. This story of the victory of Indra, equal to the Veda<br>in its sacred character, should be listened to by a king desirous of<br>victory and when his forces have been arrayed in order of battle.<br>Therefore, O best of victors, I am reciting it to thee for thy victory, O<br>Yudhishthira. High-souled persons attain prosperity when they are<br>glorified. O Yudhishthira, the destruction of high-souled Kshatriyas is<br>at hand by reason of the crimes of Duryodhana, and through the might also<br>of Bhima and Arjuna. He who readeth this story of Indra's victory with a<br>heart full of religious faith, is cleansed of his sins, attaineth a<br>region of bliss, and obtaineth joy both in this world and in the next. He<br>hath no fear of his foes; he never becometh a sonless man, never<br>encountereth any peril whatever, and enjoyeth long life. Everywhere<br>victory declareth for him, and he knoweth not what defeat is.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'O best of Bharata's race, the king, that best<br>of righteous men, thus encouraged by Salya, honoured him in proper form.<br>And Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, of powerful arms, having beard the<br>words of Salya, spoke to the king of the Madras the following words,<br>'There is no doubt that thou wilt act as the charioteer of Karna. Thou<br>must damp the spirits of Karna then by recounting the praises of Arjuna.'<br><br>"Salya said, 'Let it be so. I shall do just as thou tellest me. And I<br>shall do for thee anything else that I may be able to do.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then Salya, the king of the Madras, bade<br>farewell to the sons of Kunti. And that handsome man then went with his<br>army to Duryodhana, O repressor of foes.'"
