                            "Narada said, 'This foremost of cities that thou beholdest and which<br>resembles the Amaravati of the chief of the celestials himself, is known<br>by the name of Bhogavati. It is ruled over by Vasuki, the king of the<br>Nagas. That Shesha dwelleth here, who, in consequence of his ascetic<br>austerities of the foremost order, is able to support this earth with all<br>her vastness. His body is like that of a white mountain. He is decked in<br>celestial ornaments. He hath a thousand heads. His tongues are blazing<br>like flames of fire, and he is endued with great strength. There dwell in<br>happiness innumerable Nagas&#8212;sons of Surasa&#8212;possessed of diverse forms,<br>and decked on ornaments of diverse kinds, bearing the signs of gems,<br>Swastika, circles and drinking vessels. All of them endued with great<br>strength are by nature fierce. Some have a thousand heads, some five<br>hundred, and some three. And some have two heads, and some five, and some<br>have seven faces. And all of them are possessed of huge bodies that<br>resemble the mountains stretching over the earth. Millions and tens of<br>millions are they, in fact, uncountable, even as regards those of' them<br>that belong to a single race. Listen, however, to me as I name a few of<br>the more famous ones amongst them. They are Vasuki, Takshaka, Karkotaka,<br>Dhanjaya, Kaliya, Nahusha, Aswatara, Vakyakunda, Mani, Apurana, Khaga,<br>Vamana, Elapatra, Kukura, Kukuna, Aryaka, Nandaka, Kalasa, Potaka,<br>Kalilasaka, Pinjaraka, Airavata, Sumanmukha, Dadhimukha, Sankha, Nanda,<br>Upanandaka, Apta, Kotaraka, Sikhi, Nishthuraka, Tittiri, Hastibhadra,<br>Kumuda, Maylapindaka, the two Padmas, Pundarika, Pushpa, Mudgaraparnaka,<br>Karavira, Pitharaka, Samvritta, Vritta, Pindara, Vilwapatra, Mushikada,<br>Sirishaka, Dilipa, Sankha-sirsha, Jyotishka, Aparajita, Kauravya,<br>Dhritarashtra, Kuhara, Krisaka, Virajas, Dharana, Savahu, Mukhara, Jaya,<br>Vidhira, Andha, Visundi, Virasa, and Sarasa. These and many others there<br>are amongst the sons of Kasyapa. See O Matali, if there is anybody here<br>whom thou canst elect.'<br><br>"Kanwa continued, 'Matali, meanwhile, had been looking attentively at a<br>person that stood by. And after Narada had ceased speaking, the celestial<br>charioteer with gratified mind asked the Rishi, saying, 'Of what race is<br>he the delighter&#8212;that comely youth of great radiance&#8212;who standeth<br>before Aryaka of Kauravya's line? Who is his father, and who is his<br>mother? Of what Naga's race is he? Indeed, of what line doth he stand as<br>a high flag-staff? In consequence of his intelligence, his patience, his<br>beauty, and his youth, my heart, O celestial Rishi, hath been attracted<br>towards him. That youth will make the best of husbands for my Gunakesi.'<br><br>"Kanwa continued, 'Beholding Matali's gratification at seeing the Naga<br>called Sumukha, Narada informed him of the nobility of his parentage and<br>of his feats. And he said, 'Born in the race of Airavata this prince of<br>Nagas is named Sumukha. He is the favourite grandson of Aryaka, and the<br>daughter's son of Vamana. The father of this youth was, O Matali, the<br>Naga called Chikura. Not long before was he slain by Vinata's Son.'<br>Hearing this Matali became highly pleased, and addressing Narada, the<br>charioteer said, 'This best of Nagas is, O sire, very acceptable to me<br>for a son-in-law. Make an endeavour to secure him, for I am highly<br>pleased at the thought of bestowing on this Naga, O Muni, my dear<br>daughter.'"
