                            "Garuda said, 'O Brahmanas, since this quarter saveth from sin, and since<br>one attaineth to salvation here, it is for this saying (Uttarana) power<br>that it is called the north (uttara). And, O Galava, because the abode of<br>all the treasures of the north stretches in a line towards the east and<br>the west, therefore is the north sometimes called the central region<br>(madhyama). And, O bull among the twice-born, in this region that is<br>superior to all, none can live that is unamiable, or of unbridled<br>passions, or unrighteous. Hither, in the asylum, known by the name of<br>Vadari, eternally dwell Krishna who is Narayana's self, and Jishnu that<br>most exalted, of all male beings, and Brahman (the Creator). Hither, on<br>the breast of Himavat always dwelleth Maheswara endued with the<br>effulgence of the fire that blazeth up at the end of the Yuga. As<br>Purusha, he sporteth here with Prakriti (the universal mother). Except by<br>Nara and Narayana, he is incapable of being seen by the diverse classes<br>of Munis, the gods with Vasava at their head, the Gandharvas, the<br>Yakshas, and the Siddhas. Though invested with Maya, him the eternal<br>Vishnu alone, of a thousand heads and thousand legs, can behold. It was<br>in this region that Chandramas (the moon) was installed into the<br>sovereignty of the entire regenerate order. It was in this region, O thou<br>foremost of all acquainted with Brahma, that Mahadeva first receiving her<br>on his head, afterwards let (the sacred stream) Ganga fall from the<br>heavens to the world of men. It was here that the Goddess (Uma) underwent<br>her ascetic austerities from her desire of obtaining Maheswara (as her<br>Lord). It was in this region that Kama, the wrath (of Siva), Himavat, and<br>Uma, all together shone brilliantly. It was here, on the breast of<br>Kailasa, O Galava, that Kuvera, was installed on the sovereignty of the<br>Rakshasas, the Yakshas, and the Gandharvas. It is in this region that<br>(Kuvera's gardens called) Chitraratha lie, and it is here that the asylum<br>of (the Munis called the) Vaikhanasas is situate. It is here, O bull<br>among the twice-born, that the celestial stream called Mandakini, and the<br>mountain Mandara are to be seen. It is here that the gardens called<br>Saugandhi-kanaka are always guarded by the Rakshasas. Here are many<br>plains covered with grassy verdure, as also the plantain forest, and<br>those celestial trees called the Sautanakas. It is in this, region, O<br>Galava, that the Siddhas, with souls ever under control and always<br>sporting at will, have their fit abodes, abounding with every object of<br>enjoyment. It is here that the seven Rishis with Arundhati may be seen.<br>It is here that the constellation Swati is to be seen, and it is here<br>that it first rises to the view. It is in this region that the Grandsire<br>Brahman dwelleth in the vicinity of Yajna (sacrifice embodied). It is in<br>this quarter that the sun, the moon, and the other luminaries are seen to<br>revolve regularly.<br><br>It is in this region, O foremost of Brahmanas, that those illustrious and<br>truth-speaking Munis called by the name of Dharma, guard the source of<br>the Ganges. The origin and physical features and ascetic penances of<br>these Munis are not known to all. The thousand dishes they use for<br>serving the food offered in hospitality and the edibles also they create<br>at will, are all a mystery, The man, O Galava, that passeth beyond the<br>point guarded by these Munis, is certain, O foremost of Brahmanas, to<br>meet with destruction. None else, O bull among Brahmanas, save the divine<br>Narayana, and the eternal Nara called also Jishnu, succeeded in passing<br>beyond the point so guarded. It is in this region that the mountains of<br>Kailasa lie, the abode of Ailavila (Kuvera). It is here that the ten<br>Apsaras known by the name of Vidyutprabha had their origin. In covering,<br>O Brahmana, the three worlds with three steps in the sacrifice of Vali<br>(the Asura king), Vishnu had covered this whole northern region; and,<br>accordingly, there is a spot here called Vishnupada. And it is so called<br>after the footprint of Vishnu caused on that occasion. Here, in this<br>quarter, at a place called Usiravija, by the side of the golden lake,<br>king Marutta performed, O foremost of Brahmanas, a sacrifice. It is here<br>that the brilliant and shining gold mines of Himavat exhibit themselves<br>to the illustrious and regenerate Rishi Jimuta. And Jimuta gave away the<br>whole of that wealth to the Brahmanas. And having given it away, that<br>great Rishi solicited them to call it after his own name. And hence that<br>wealth is known by the name of the Jaimuta gold. Here, in this region, O<br>bull among Bharatas, the regents of the worlds, O Galava, every morning<br>and evening, proclaim, 'What business of what person shall we do?' It is<br>for these, O foremost of Brahmanas, and other incidents, that the<br>northern region is superior to all quarters. And because this region is<br>superior (uttara) to all, therefore, it is called the north (uttara). The<br>four regions have thus, O sire, been, one after another described to thee<br>in details. Towards which quarter then dost thou desire to go? I am<br>ready, O foremost of Brahmanas, to show thee all the quarters of the<br>earth!'"
