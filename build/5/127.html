                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing in that assembly of the Kurus these words<br>that were disagreeable to him, Duryodhana replied unto the mighty-armed<br>Kesava of great fame, saying. 'It behoveth thee, O Kesava, to speak after<br>reflecting on all circumstances. Indeed, uttering such harsh words, thou,<br>without any reason, findest fault with me alone, addressed regardfully as<br>thou always art by the sons of Pritha, O slayer of Madhu. But dost thou<br>censure me, having surveyed the strength and weakness (of both sides)?<br>Indeed, thyself and Kshattri, the King, the Preceptor, and the Grandsire,<br>all reproach me alone and not any other monarch. I, however, do not find<br>the least fault in myself. Yet all of you, including the (old) king<br>himself, hate me. O repressor of foes, I do not, even after reflection,<br>behold any grave fault in me, or even O Kesava, any fault however minute.<br>In the game at dice, O slayer of Madhu, that was joyfully accepted by<br>them, the Pandavas were vanquished and their kingdom was won by Sakuni.<br>What blame can be mine as regards that? On the other hand, O slayer of<br>Madhu, the wealth that was won from the Pandavas then, was ordered by me,<br>to be returned unto them. It cannot, again, O foremost of victors, be any<br>fault of ours that the invincible Pandavas, were defeated once again at<br>dice and had to go to the Woods. Imputing what fault to us, do they<br>regard us as their enemies? And, O Krishna, though (really) weak, why do<br>the Pandavas yet so cheerfully seek a quarrel with us, as if they were<br>strong? What have we done to them? For what injury (done to them) do the<br>sons of Pandu, along with the Srinjayas, seek to slaughter the sons of<br>Dhritarashtra? We shall not in consequence of any fierce deed, or<br>(alarming) word (of theirs), bow down to them in fear, deprived of our<br>senses. We cannot bow down to Indra himself, let alone the sons of Pandu.<br>I do not, O Krishna, see the man, observant of Kshatriya virtues, who<br>can, O slayer of foes, venture to conquer us in battle. Let alone the<br>Pandavas, O slayer of Madhu, the very gods are not competent to vanquish<br>Bhishma, Kripa, Drona and Karna, in battle. If, O Madhava, we are, in the<br>observance of the practices of our order, cut off with weapons in battle,<br>when our end comes, even that will lead us to heaven. Even this, O<br>Janardana, is our highest duty as Kshatriyas, viz., that we should lay<br>ourselves down on the field of battle on a bed of arrows. If, without<br>bowing to our enemies, ours be the bed of arrows in battle, that, O<br>Madhava, will never grieve us. Who is there, born in a noble race and<br>conforming to Kshatriya practices, that would from fear bow to an enemy,<br>desirous only of saving his life? Those Kshatriyas that desire their own<br>good, accept regardfully this saying of Matanga, viz., that (as regards a<br>Kshatriya), one should always keep himself erect, and never bow down, for<br>exertion alone is manliness; one should rather break at the knots than<br>bend. A person like me should only bow down to the Brahmanas for the sake<br>of piety, without regarding anybody else. (As regards persons other than<br>Brahmanas), one should, as long as one lives, act according to Matanga's<br>saying. Even this is the duty of Kshatriyas; even this is ever my<br>opinion. That share in the kingdom which was formerly given them by my<br>father shall never again, O Kesava, be obtainable by them as long as I<br>live. As long, O Janardana, as king Dhritarashtra liveth, both ourselves<br>and they, sheathing our weapons, O Madhava, should live in dependence on<br>him. Given away formerly from ignorance or fear, when I was a child and<br>dependent on others, the kingdom, O Janardana, incapable of being given<br>away again, shall not, O delighter of Vrishni's race, be obtainable by<br>the Pandavas. At present, O Kesava of mighty arms, as long as I live,<br>even that much of our land which may be covered by the point of a sharp<br>needle shall not, O Madhava, be given by us unto the Pandavas.'"
