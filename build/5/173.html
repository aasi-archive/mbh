                            "Bhishma said, 'O great king, Rochamana is another Maharatha of the<br>Pandavas. He will, O Bharata, contend in battle against hostile warriors,<br>like a second god. That subjugator of foes, the mighty bowman Kuntibhoja<br>of great strength, the maternal uncle of Bhimasena, is, in my judgment,<br>an Atiratha. This mighty and heroic bowman is well-versed and highly<br>skilled in fight. Acquainted with all modes of warfare, this bull among<br>car-warriors is regarded by me as exceedingly competent. Displaying his<br>prowess he will fight, like a second Indra against the Danavas. Those<br>celebrated soldiers that he owns are all accomplished in fight. Stationed<br>on the side of the Pandavas and devoted to what is agreeable and<br>beneficial to them, that hero will, for the sake of his sister's sons<br>achieve extra-ordinary feats. That prince of Rakshasas (Ghatotkacha), O<br>king, born of Bhima and Hidimva, and endued with ample powers of<br>illusion, is, in my judgment, a leader of the leaders of car-divisions.<br>Fond of battle, and endued with powers of illusion, he will, O sire,<br>fight earnestly in battle. Those heroic Rakshasas who are his counsellors<br>or dependents will also fight under him.<br><br>'These and many other rulers of provinces, headed by Vasudeva, have<br>assembled for the sake of Pandu's son. These, O king, are principally the<br>Rathas, Atirathas, and half Rathas of the high-souled Pandava, and these,<br>O king, will lead in battle the terrible army of Yudhishthira which is<br>protected, again, by that hero, the diadem-decked (Arjuna), who is even<br>like the great Indra himself. It is with them (thus) endued with powers<br>of illusion and fired by the desire of success that I shall contend in<br>battle, expectant of victory or death. I shall advance against these two<br>foremost of car-warriors, Vasudeva and Arjuna, bearing (respectively)<br>Gandiva and the discus, and resembling the sun and the moon as seen<br>together in the evening. I shall, on the field of battle, encounter also<br>those other car-warriors of Yudhishthira (whom I have, mentioned) at the<br>head of their respective troops.<br><br>'The Rathas and Atirathas, according to their precedence, have now been<br>declared by me to thee, and they also that are half Rathas, belonging to<br>thee or them, O chief of the Kauravas! Arjuna and Vasudeva and other<br>lords of earth that may be there, all of them, upon whom my eyes may<br>fall, I will withstand, O Bharata! But, thou of mighty arms, I will not<br>strike or slay Sikhandin the prince of Panchalas, even if I behold him<br>rushing against me in battle with weapons upraised. The world knows how<br>from a desire of doing what was agreeable to my father, that I gave up<br>the kingdom that had become mine and lived in the observance of the<br>Brahmacharya vow. I then installed Chitrangada in the sovereignty of the<br>Kauravas, making at the same time the child Vichitravirya the Yuvaraja.<br>Having notified my god-like vow among all the kings of the earth, I shall<br>never slay a woman or one that was formerly a woman. It may be known to<br>you, O king, that Sikhandin was formerly a woman. Having been born as a<br>daughter, she afterwards became metamorphosed into the male sex. I shall<br>not, O Bharata, fight against him. I shall certainly smite all other<br>kings, O bull of Bharata's race, whom I may encounter in battle. I will<br>not, however, O king, be able to slay the sons of Kunti!'"
