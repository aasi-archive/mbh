                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Thus addressed by Vasudeva, the ever-wrathful Bhima,<br>incapable of bearing insults, was immediately awakened like a steed of<br>high metal, and replied, without losing a moment, saying, 'O Achyuta, I<br>wish to act in a particular way; thou, however, takest me in quite a<br>different light. That I take great delight in war and that my prowess is<br>incapable of being baffled, must, O Krishna. be well-known to thee in<br>consequence of our having lived together for a long time. Or it may be,<br>thou knowest me not, like one swimming in a lake ignorant of its depth.<br>It is for this that thou chidest me in such unbecoming words. Who else, O<br>Madhava, knowing me to be Bhimasena, could address me with such<br>unbecoming words as thou dost? Therefore, I shall tell thee, O delighter<br>of the Vrishnis, about my own prowess and unrivalled might. Although to<br>speak of one's own prowess is always an ignoble act, yet, pierced as I am<br>by thy unfriendly strictures, I will speak of my own might. Behold, O<br>Krishna, these&#8212;the firmament and the earth&#8212;which are immovable,<br>immense, and infinite, and which are the refuge of, and in which are born<br>these countless creatures. If through anger these suddenly collide like<br>two hills, just I, with my arms, can keep them asunder with all their<br>mobile and immobile objects. Behold the joints of these my mace-like<br>arms. I find not the person who can extricate himself having once come<br>within their grasp. The Himavat, the ocean, the mighty wielder of the<br>thunderbolt himself, viz., the slayer of Vala,&#8212;even these three cannot,<br>with all their power extricate the person attacked by me. I will easily<br>trample on the ground under my feet all the Kshatriyas, who will come to<br>battle against the Pandavas. It is not known to thee, O Achyuta, with<br>what prowess I vanquished the kings of the earth and brought them under<br>subjection. If, indeed, thou really knowest not my prowess which is like<br>the fierce energy of the midday sun thou wilt then know it, O Janardana,<br>in the fierce melee of battle. Thou woundest me with thy cruel words,<br>paining me with the pain of opening a foetid tumour. But know me to be<br>mightier than what I have said of myself of my own accord. On that day,<br>when the fierce and destructive havoc of battle will begin, thou will<br>then see me felling elephants and car-warriors combatants on steeds and<br>those on elephants, and slaying in rage the foremost of Kshatriya<br>warriors. Thou, as well as others, wilt see me doing all this and<br>grinding down the foremost of combatants. The marrow of my bones hath not<br>yet decayed, nor doth my heart tremble. If the whole world rusheth<br>against me in wrath, I do not yet feel the influence of fear. It is only<br>for the sake of compassion, O slayer of Madhu, that I am for displaying<br>goodwill to the foe. I am far quietly bearing all our injuries, lest the<br>Bharata race be extirpated.'"
