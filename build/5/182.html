                            "Bhishma said, 'I then smilingly addressed Rama stationed for battle,<br>saying,&#8212;Myself on my car, I do not wish to fight with thee that art on<br>the earth! Mount on a car, O hero, and case thy body in mail, O<br>mighty-armed one, if indeed, O Rama, thou wishest to fight me in<br>battle!&#8212;Then Rama smilingly replied unto me on that field of battle,<br>saying, 'The Earth, O Bhishma, is my car, and Vedas, like good steeds,<br>are the animals that carry me! The wind is my car-driver, and my coat of<br>mail is constituted by those mothers in the Vedas (viz., Gayatri, Savitri<br>and Saraswati). Well-covered by these in battle, O son of Kuru's race, I<br>will fight!' Having said this, O Gandhari's son. Rama of prowess<br>incapable of being baffled, covered me on all sides with a thick shower<br>of arrows. I then beheld Jamadagni's son stationed on a car equipped with<br>every kind of excellent weapons! And the car he rode was exceedingly<br>handsome and was of wonderful appearance. And it had been created by a<br>fiat of his will, and it was beautiful like a town. And celestial steeds<br>were yoked unto it, and it was well-protected by the necessary defences.<br>And it was decked all over with ornaments of gold. And it was<br>well-covered with tough skins all around, and bore the device of the sun<br>and the moon. Rama was armed with bow and equipped with a quiver, and<br>with fingers cased in leathern fences! Akritavrana, the dear friend of<br>Bhargava, well-versed in the Vedas, did the duties of a car-driver for<br>that warrior. And he, of Bhrigu's race, repeatedly summoning me to<br>battle, saying,&#8212;Come, come,&#8212;gladden my heart. And I then, myself,<br>singly obtained for my adversary that invincible and mighty exterminator<br>of the Kshatriya race, viz., Rama risen like the sun himself in<br>splendour, desirous (on his part) of fighting singly! And after he had<br>poured three showers of arrows on me curbing my steeds, I came down from<br>my car and placing my bow aside I proceeded on foot to that best of<br>Rishis. And arriving before him, I worshipped the best of Brahmanas with<br>reverence. And having saluted him duly, I told him these excellent<br>words,&#8212;O Rama, whether thou art equal or superior to me, I will fight<br>with thee, my virtuous preceptor, in battle! O lord, bless me, wishing me<br>victory!'<br><br>"Rama, thus addressed, said, 'O foremost one of Kuru's race, he that<br>desires prosperity should act even thus! O thou of mighty arms, they that<br>fight with warriors more eminent than themselves, have this duty to<br>perform. O king, I would have cursed thee if thou hadst not approached me<br>thus! Go, fight carefully and summoning all thy patience, O thou of<br>Kuru's race! I cannot, however, wish thee victory, for I myself stand<br>here to vanquish thee! Go, fight fairly! I am pleased with thy<br>behaviour!&#8212;Bowing unto him, I then speedily came back, and mounting on<br>my car, I once more blew my conch decked with gold, And then, O Bharata,<br>the combat commenced between him and me. And it lasted for many days.<br>each of us, O king, having been desirous of vanquishing the other. And in<br>that battle, it was Rama who struck me first with nine hundred and sixty<br>straight arrows furnished with vulturine wings. And with that arrowy<br>shower, O king, my four steeds and charioteer were completely covered!<br>Notwithstanding all this, however, I remained quiet in that encounter,<br>accoutred in my coat of mail! Bowing unto the gods, and especially unto<br>the Brahmanas, I then smilingly addressed Rama stationed for battle,<br>saying,&#8212;Although thou hast shown little regard for me, yet I have fully<br>honoured thy preceptorship! Listen again, O Brahmana, to some other<br>auspicious duty that should be discharged if virtue is to be earned! The<br>Vedas that are in thy body, and the high status of Brahmana that is also<br>in thee, and the ascetic merit thou hast earned by the severest of<br>austerities, I do not strike at these! I strike, however, at that<br>Kshatriyahood which thou, O Rama, hast adopted! When a Brahmana taketh up<br>weapons, he becometh a Kshatriya. Behold now the power of my bow and the<br>energy of my arms! Speedily shall I cut off that bow of thine with a<br>sharp shaft!&#8212;Saying this I shot at him, O bull of Bharata's race, a<br>sharp broad-headed arrow, And cutting off one of the horns of his bow<br>with it. I caused it to drop on the ground. I then shot at Jamadagni's<br>car a hundred straight arrows winged with vulturine feathers. Piercing<br>through Rama's body and borne along by the wind, those arrows coursing<br>through space seemed to vomit blood (from their mouths) and resembled<br>veritable snakes. Covered all over with blood and with blood issuing out<br>of his body. Rama, O king, shone in battle, like the Sumeru mountain with<br>streams of liquid metal rolling down its breast, or like the Asoka tree<br>at the advent of spring, when covered with red bunches of flowers, or, O<br>king, like the Kinsuka tree when clad in its flowery attire! Taking up<br>then another bow, Rama, filled with wrath, showered upon me numerous<br>arrows of excessive sharpness, furnished with golden wings. And those<br>fierce arrows of tremendous impetus, resembling snakes, or fire, or<br>poison, coming at me from all sides, pierced my very vitals and caused me<br>to tremble. Summoning all my coolness then addressed myself for the<br>encounter, and filled with rage I pierced Rama with a hundred arrows. And<br>afflicted with those hundred blazing shafts resembling either fire, or<br>the sun or looking like snakes of virulent poison, Rama seemed to lose<br>his senses! Filled, O Bharata, with pity (at the sight), I stopped of my<br>own accord and said,&#8212;Oh, fie on battle! Fie on Kshatriya practices! And<br>overwhelmed, O king, with grief, I repeatedly said,&#8212;Alas, great is the<br>sin committed by me through observance of Kshatriya practices, since I<br>have afflicted with arrows my preceptor who is a Brahmana endued with a<br>virtuous soul!&#8212;After that, O Bharata, I ceased striking Jamadagni's son<br>any more. At this time, the thousand-rayed luminary, having heated the<br>earth with his rays, proceeded at the close of day to his chambers in the<br>west and the battle also between us ceased.'"
