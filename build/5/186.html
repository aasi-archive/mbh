                            "Bhishma said, 'Then, O great king, during the night, having bowed unto<br>the Brahmanas, the Rishis, the gods, and all those creatures that wander<br>during the dark, and also all the kings of the earth, I laid myself down<br>on my bed, and in the solitude of my room, I began to reflect in the<br>following way.&#8212;For many days hath this fierce combat of terrible<br>consequence lasted between myself and Jamadagni. I am unable, however, to<br>vanquish on the field of battle that Rama of mighty energy. If indeed, I<br>am competent to vanquish in battle that Brahmana of mighty strength,<br>viz., Jamadagni's son of great prowess, then let the gods kindly show<br>themselves to me this night!&#8212;Mangled with arrows as I lay asleep, O<br>great king, that night on my right side, towards the morning, those<br>foremost of Brahmanas who had raised me when I had fallen down from my<br>car and held me up and said unto me&#8212;Do not fear&#8212;and who had comforted<br>me, showed themselves to me, O king, in a dream! And they stood<br>surrounding me and said these words. Listen to them as I repeat them to<br>thee, O perpetuator of Kuru's race! Rise, O Ganga's son, thou needst have<br>no fear! We will protect thee, for thou art our own body! Rama, the son<br>of Jamadagni, will never be able to vanquish thee in battle! Thou, O bull<br>of Bharata's race, wilt be the conqueror of Rama in combat! This beloved<br>weapon, O Bharata, called Praswapa, appertaining to the lord of all<br>creatures, and forged by the divine artificer, will come to thy<br>knowledge, for it was known to thee in thy former life! Neither Rama, nor<br>any person on earth is acquainted with it. Recollect it, therefore, O<br>thou of mighty arms, and apply it with strength! O king of kings, O<br>sinless one, it will come to thee of itself! With it, O Kaurava, thou<br>wilt be able to check all persons endued with mighty energy! O king, Rama<br>will not be slain outright by it, thou shalt not, therefore, O giver of<br>honours, incur any sin by using it! Afflicted by the force of this thy<br>weapon, the son of Jamadagni, will fall asleep! Vanquishing him thus,<br>thou wilt again awaken him in battle, O Bhishma, with that dear weapon<br>called Samvodhana! Do what we have told thee, O Kauravya, in the morning,<br>stationed on thy car. Asleep or dead we reckon it as the same, O king,<br>Rama will not surely die! Apply, therefore, this Praswapa weapon so<br>happily thought of!&#8212;Having said this, O king, those foremost of<br>Brahmanas, eight in number and resembling one another in form, and<br>possessed of effulgent bodies, all vanished from my sight!'"
