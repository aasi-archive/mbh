                            OM! HAVING BOWED down to Narayana, and Nara the most exalted of male<br>beings, and also to the goddess Saraswati, must the word Jaya be uttered.<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then those valiant descendants of Kuru, who belonged<br>to the same party (with Virata), having joyfully celebrated the nuptials<br>of Abhimanyu and rested themselves that night, presented themselves at<br>dawn, well pleased, in the court of Virata, And the chamber of the king<br>of the Matsya was full of riches, and variegated with choice gems and<br>precious stones, with seats methodically arranged, adorned with garlands,<br>and filled with fragrance. And those mighty monarchs of men all came to<br>that place, And on the seats in front sat the two kings Virata and<br>Drupada. And the revered and aged rulers of the earth, and Valarama and<br>Krishna along with their father, all sat there. And close to the king of<br>Panchala was seated the great hero of the race of Sini, together with the<br>son of Rohini. And side by side with the king of the Matsya sat Krishna<br>and Yudhishthira, and all the sons of king Drupada, and Bhima and Arjuna,<br>and the two sons of Madri, and Pradyumna and Samva, both valiant in<br>battle, and Abhimanyu with Virata's sons. And those princes, the sons of<br>Draupadi, rivalling their fathers in valour, strength, grace, and<br>prowess, sat upon excellent seats inlaid with gold. And when those mighty<br>heroes wearing shining ornaments and robes had set themselves down, that<br>gorgeous assembly of kings looked beautiful like the firmament spangled<br>with resplendent stars. And those valiant men, assembled together, having<br>conversed with one another upon various topics, remained for some time in<br>a pensive mood, with their eyes fixed upon Krishna. And at the end of<br>their talk, Krishna drew their attention to the affairs of the Pandavas.<br>And those powerful kings together listened to Krishna's speech, pregnant<br>and lofty. And Krishna said, It is known to you all, how this<br>Yudhishthira was deceitfully defeated at dice by the son of Suvala, and<br>how he was robbed of his kingdom and how a stipulation was made by him<br>concerning his exile in the forest. And capable as they were of<br>conquering the earth by force, the sons of Pandu remained firm in their<br>plighted faith. And accordingly for six and seven years these<br>incomparable men accomplished the cruel task imposed upon them. And this<br>last, the thirteenth year, was exceedingly hard for them to pass. Yet<br>unrecognised by any one they have passed it, as known to you, suffering<br>unendurable hardships of various kinds. This is known to you all. These<br>illustrious men have spent the thirteenth year, employed in menial<br>service of others. This being so, it is for you to consider what will be<br>for the good of both Yudhishthira and Duryodhana, and what, as regards<br>the Kurus and the Pandavas, will be consistent with the rules of<br>righteousness and, propriety and what will meet with the approbation of<br>all. The virtuous king Yudhishthira would not unrighteously covet even<br>the celestial kingdom. But righteously he would accept the rule even of a<br>single village. How the sons of Dhritarashtra fraudulently robbed him of<br>his paternal kingdom, and how he hath passed a life of unendurable<br>hardships, are known to all the kings assembled here. The sons of<br>Dhritarashtra are incapable of overcoming by strength Arjuna, the son of<br>Pritha. Nevertheless, king Yudhishthira and his friends have no other<br>desire than the good of Dhritarashtra's son. These brave sons of Kunti,<br>and the two sons of Madri, ask for only what they themselves, achieving<br>victory in battle, had won from the defeated kings. You, no doubt, know<br>full well how those enemies of the Pandavas&#8212;with the object of<br>possessing themselves of the kingdom, endeavoured by various means to<br>destroy them, when they were yet mere boys. So wicked and rancorous they<br>were. Consider, how grasping they are and how virtuous Yudhishthira is.<br>Consider also the relationship that exists between them. I beseech you<br>all to consult together and also think separately. The Pandavas have<br>always had a regard for truth. They have fulfilled their promise to the<br>very letter. If now treated wrongfully by the sons of Dhritarashtra, they<br>would slay them all though banded together. They have friends, who, on<br>being informed of their unworthy treatment at the hands of others, would<br>stand by them, engaged in fight with their persecutors, and willingly<br>slay them even if they should lose their own lives for it. If you suppose<br>them to be too few to be capable of winning a victory over their enemies,<br>you must know that united together and followed by their friends, they<br>would, no doubt, try their utmost to destroy those enemies. What<br>Duryodhana thinks is not exactly known, nor what he may do. When the mind<br>of the other side is not known, what opinion can be formed by you as to<br>what is best to be done? Therefore, let a person, virtuous and honest and<br>of respectable birth, and wary,&#8212;an able ambassador, set out to beseech<br>them mildly for inducing them to give half the kingdom to Yudhishthira.<br>Having listened to the speech of Krishna, marked by prudence and a regard<br>for virtue and showing a pacific and impartial spirit, his elder brother<br>then addressed the assembly bestowing high encomiums on the words of the<br>younger brother.'"
