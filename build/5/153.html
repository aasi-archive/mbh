                            "Vaisampayana said, 'King Yudhishthira then caused his troops to encamp<br>on a part of the field that was level, cool, and abounding with grass and<br>fuel. Avoiding cemeteries, temples and compounds consecrated to the<br>deities, asylums of sages, shrines, and other sacred plots. Kunti's<br>high-souled son, Yudhishthira, pitched his camp on a delightful, fertile,<br>open and sacred part of the plain. And rising up, again, after his<br>animals had been given sufficient rest, the king set out joyously<br>surrounded by hundreds and thousands of monarchs. And Kesava accompanied<br>by Partha began to move about, scattering numerous soldiers of<br>Dhritarashtra (kept as outposts). And Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race<br>and that mighty car-warrior of great energy, viz., Yuyudhana, otherwise<br>called Satyaki, measured the ground for the encampment. And arrived, O<br>Bharata, at the holy Hiranwati which flows through Kurukshetra, which was<br>filled with sacred water, and whose bed was divested of pointed pebbles<br>and mire, and which was regarded as an excellent tirtha, Kesava caused a<br>moat to be excavated there, and for its protection stationed a sufficient<br>number of troops with proper instructions. And the rules that were<br>observed in respect of the tents of the high-souled Pandavas, were<br>followed by Kesava in the matter of the tents he caused to be set up for<br>the kings (that came as their allies). And, O monarch, costly tents,<br>incapable of being attacked, apart from one another, were, by hundreds<br>and thousands, set up for those kings on the surface of the earth, that<br>looked like palatial residences and abounded with fuels and edibles and<br>drinks. And there were assembled hundreds upon hundreds of skilled<br>mechanics, in receipt of regular wages and surgeons and physicians,<br>well-versed in their own science, and furnished with every ingredient<br>they might need. And king Yudhishthira caused to be placed in every<br>pavilion large quantities, high as hills, of bow-strings and bows and<br>coats of mail and weapons, honey and clarified butter, pounded lac,<br>water, fodder of cattle, chaff and coals, heavy machines, long shafts,<br>lances, battleaxes, bow-staffs, breast-plates, scimitars and quivers. And<br>innumerable elephants cased in plates of steel with prickles thereon,<br>huge as hills, and capable of fighting with hundreds and thousands, were<br>seen there. And learning that the Pandavas had encamped on that field,<br>their allies, O Bharata, with their forces and animals, began to march<br>thither. And many kings who had practised Brahmacharya vows, drunk<br>(consecrated) Soma and had made large presents to Brahmanas at<br>sacrifices, came there for the success of the sons of Pandu.'"
