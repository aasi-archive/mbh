                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Next morning, under a cloudless sky, all the kings,<br>urged by Dhritarashtra's son, Duryodhana,&#8212;set out against the Pandavas.<br>And all of them had purified themselves by baths, were decked in<br>garlands, and attired in white robes. And having poured libations on<br>fire, caused Brahmanas to utter benedictions on them, they took up their<br>weapons and raised their (respective) standards. And all of them were<br>conversant with the Vedas, and endued with great bravery, and had<br>practised excellent vows. And all of them were grantors of (other<br>people's) wishes, and all were skilled in battle. Endued with great<br>strength, they set out, reposing confidence on one another, and with<br>singleness of purpose desiring to win in battle the highest regions. And<br>first Vinda and Anuvinda, both of Avanti, and Kekayas, and the Vahlikas,<br>all set out with Bharadwaja's son at their head. Then came Aswatthaman,<br>and Santanu's son (Bhishma), and Jayadratha of the country of the Sindhu,<br>and the kings of the southern and the western countries and of the hilly<br>regions, and Sakuni, the ruler of the Gandharas, and all the chiefs of<br>the eastern and the northern regions, and the Sakas, the Kiratas, and<br>Yavanas, the Sivis and the Vasatis with their Maharathas at the heads of<br>their respective divisions. All these great car-warriors marched in the<br>second division. Then came Kritavarman at the head of his troops, and<br>that mighty car-warrior, viz., the ruler of the Trigartas, and the king<br>Duryodhana surrounded by his brothers, and Sala, and Bhurisravas, and<br>Salya, and Vrihadratha, the ruler of the Kosalas. These all marched in<br>the rear, with Dhritarashtra's sons at their head. And all these<br>Dhartarashtras endued with great might, uniting together in proper order,<br>and all clad in mail, took up their position at the other end of<br>Kurukshetra, and, O Bharata, Duryodhana caused his encampment to be so<br>adorned as to make it look like a second Hastinapura. Indeed, O king,<br>even those that were clever among the citizens of Hastinapura could not<br>distinguish their city from the encampment. And the Kuru king caused<br>inaccessible pavilions, similar to his own, to be erected by hundreds and<br>thousands for the (other) kings (in his army). And those tents, O king,<br>for the accommodation of the troops were well-planted on an area<br>measuring full five yojanas of that field of battle. And into those tents<br>by thousands that were full of provisions, the rulers of the earth<br>entered, each according to his courage according to the strength he<br>possessed. And king Duryodhana ordered excellent provisions to be<br>supplied for all those high-souled kings with their troops consisting of<br>infantry, elephants, and horses, and with all their followers. And as<br>regards all those that subsisted upon mechanical arts and all the bards,<br>singers, and panegyrists devoted to his cause, and vendors and traders,<br>and prostitutes, and spies, and persons who had come to witness the<br>battle, the Kuru king made due provision for all of them.'"
