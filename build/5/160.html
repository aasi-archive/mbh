                            "Janamejaya said, 'After the soldiers had been arrayed thus in order of<br>battle (on the field of Kurukshetra), what, O bull among Brahmanas, did<br>the Kauravas then do, urged as they were by destiny itself?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'After the soldiers, O bull of the Bharata race, had<br>been arrayed thus in order of battle, Dhritarashtra, O, king, said these<br>words to Sanjaya.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Come, O Sanjaya, tell me with the fullest details<br>all that hath happened in the encampment of the Kuru and the Pandava<br>troops. I regard destiny to be superior, and exertion useless, for<br>although I understand the evil consequences of war that will lead only to<br>ruin, still I am unable to restrain my son who rejoices in gambling and<br>considers deceit to be wisdom. Understanding everything, I am not yet<br>able to secure my own welfare. O Suta, my understanding is capable of<br>seeing the defects (of measures), but when I approach Duryodhana, that<br>understanding of mine turneth away (from that right path). When such is<br>the case, O Sanjaya, that will be which must be. Indeed, the sacrifice of<br>one's corporeal body in battle is the laudable duty of every Kshatriya.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'This question, O great king, that thou hast put, is<br>indeed, worthy of thee. It behoveth thee not, however, to impute entire<br>fault to Duryodhana only. Listen to me, O king, as I speak of this<br>exhaustively. That man who cometh by evil in consequence of his own<br>misconduct, should never impute the fault to either time or the gods. O<br>great king, he amongst men who perpetrateth every wicked act, deserveth<br>to be slain in consequence of his perpetrating those acts. Afflicted with<br>injuries in consequence of the match at dice, the sons of Pandu, however,<br>with all their counsellors quietly bore all those injuries, looking up, O<br>best of men, to thy face alone. Hear from me fully, O king, of the<br>slaughter that is about to take place in battle, of steeds and elephants<br>and kings endued with immeasurable energy. Hearing patiently, O thou that<br>art endued with great wisdom, of the destruction of the world in the<br>fierce battle that has been brought about, come to this conclusion and no<br>other, viz., that man is never the agent of his acts right or wrong.<br>Indeed, like a wooden machine, man is not an agent (in all he does). In<br>this respect, three opinions are entertained; some say that everything is<br>ordained by God; some say that our acts are the result of free-will; and<br>others say that our acts are the result of those of our past lives.<br>Listen then, therefore, with patience, to the evil that hath come upon<br>us.'"
