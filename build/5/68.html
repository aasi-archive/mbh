                            "Sanjaya said, 'Those adorable bowmen, Arjuna and Vasudeva, who are<br>perfectly equal unto each other in respect of their godlike nature, have<br>taken their births of their own will. O lord, the discus owned by<br>Vasudeva, of abundant energy, occupieth a space full five cubits in<br>diameter, is capable also of being hurled at the foe (in forms large or<br>small) according to the will of the wielder himself, and it dependeth on<br>illusion. Always conspicuous by its effulgence, it is invisible to the<br>Kurus; and in ascertaining the strength or weakness of the Pandavas, that<br>discus offers the best ground. Indeed, that scion of Madhu's race, endued<br>with great might, vanquished with an effort and in seeming playfulness<br>the formidable Naraka and Samvara and Kansa and (Sisupala) the chief of<br>Chedis. Possessed of divinity and of soul superior to everything, that<br>most exalted of male beings can, by his will alone, bring the earth,<br>firmament, and heaven under his control. Thou askest me repeatedly, O<br>king, about the Pandavas for knowing their strength and weakness. Listen<br>now to all that in brief. If the whole universe be placed on one scale<br>and Janardana on the other, even then Janardana will outweigh the entire<br>universe. Janardana, at his pleasure, can reduce the universe to ashes,<br>but the entire universe is incapable of reducing Janardana to ashes.<br>Wherever there is truthfulness, wherever virtue, wherever modesty,<br>wherever simplicity, even there is Govinda. And thither where Krishna is,<br>success must be. That soul of all creatures, most exalted of male beings,<br>Janardana, guideth, as if in sport, the entire earth, the firmament, and<br>the heaven. Making the Pandavas the indirect means, and beguiling the<br>whole world. Janardana wisheth to blast thy wicked sons that are all<br>addicted to sin. Endued with divine attributes, Kesava, by the power of<br>his soul causeth the wheel of Time, the wheel of the Universe, and the<br>wheel of the Yuga, to revolve incessantly. And I tell thee truly that<br>glorious Being is alone the Lord of Time, of Death, and of this Universe<br>of mobile and immobile objects. That great ascetic Hari, though the Lord<br>of the whole Universe, still betaketh himself to work, like a humble<br>labourer that tilleth the fields. Indeed, Kesava beguileth all by the aid<br>of His illusion. Those men, however, that have attained to Him are not<br>deceived.'"
