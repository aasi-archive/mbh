                            "Nakula said, 'Much hath been said, O Madhava, by king Yudhishthira the<br>just who is conversant with morality and endued with liberality, and thou<br>hast heard what hath been said by Falguni also. As regards my own<br>opinion, O hero, thou hast repeatedly expressed it, Hearing first what<br>the wishes of the enemy are and disregarding all, do what thou regardest<br>to be proper for the occasion. O Kesava, diverse are the conclusions<br>arrived at as regards diverse matters. Success, however, O chastiser of<br>foes, is won when a man doth that which ought to be done in view of the<br>occasion. When a thing is settled in one way on one occasion, it becometh<br>unsuitable when the occasion becometh different. Persons, therefore, in<br>this world, O foremost of men, cannot stick to the same opinion<br>throughout. While we were living in the woods, our hearts were inclined<br>towards a particular course of action. While we were passing the period<br>of concealment, our wishes were of one kind, and now, at the present<br>time, O Krishna, when concealment is no longer necessary, our wishes have<br>become different. O thou of the Vrishni race, while we wandered in the<br>woods, attachment for the kingdom was not so great as now. The period of<br>our exile having ceased, hearing, O hero, that we have returned, an army<br>numbering full seven Akshauhinis hath, through thy grace, O Janardana,<br>been assembled. Beholding these tigers among men, of inconceivable might<br>and prowess, standing equipped for battle armed with weapons, what man is<br>there that will not be struck with fear? Therefore going into the midst<br>of the Kurus, speak thou first words fraught with mildness and then those<br>fraught with threats, so that the wicked Suyodhana may be agitated with<br>fear. What mortal man is there, of flesh and blood, who would encounter<br>in battle Yudhishthira and Bhimasena, the invincible Vibhatsu and<br>Sahadeva, myself, thyself and Rama, O Kesava, and Satyaki of mighty<br>energy. Virata with his sons, Drupada with his allies, and<br>Dhrishtadyumna, O Madhava, and the ruler of Kasi of great prowess and<br>Dhrishtaketu the lord of the Chedis? No sooner wilt thou go there than<br>thou wilt, without doubt, accomplish, O thou of mighty arms, the desired<br>object of king Yudhishthira the just. Vidura, and Bhishma and Drona and<br>Vahlika, these talents, O sinless one, will understand thee when thou<br>wouldst utter words of wisdom. They will solicit that ruler of men,<br>Dhritarashtra and Suyodhana of sinful disposition, with his counsellors,<br>to act according to the advice. When thou, O Janardana, art the speaker<br>and Vidura the listener, what subject is there that cannot be rendered<br>smooth and plain?'"
