                            "Vaisampayana said, 'King Dhritarashtra endued with great wisdom (then)<br>said to the orderly-in-waiting, 'I desire to see Vidura. Bring him here<br>without delay.' Despatched by Dhritarashtra, the messenger went to<br>Kshatri and said, 'O thou of great wisdom, our lord the mighty king<br>desireth to see thee.' Thus addressed, Vidura (set out and) coming to the<br>palace, spoke unto the orderly, 'Apprise Dhritarashtra of my arrival.'<br>Thereupon the orderly went to Dhritarashtra, and said, O, foremost of<br>kings, Vidura is here at thy command. He wisheth to behold thy feet.<br>Command me as to what he is to do.' Thereupon Dhritarashtra said, 'Let<br>Vidura of great wisdom and foresight enter. I am never unwilling or<br>unprepared to see Vidura.' The orderly then went out and spoke unto<br>Vidura, 'O Kshatri, enter the inner apartments of the wise king. The king<br>says that he is never unwilling to see thee.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having entered Dhritarashtra's chamber, Vidura<br>said with joined hands unto that ruler of men who was then plunged in<br>thought, 'O thou of great wisdom, I am Vidura, arrived here at thy<br>command. If there is anything to be done, here I am, command me!'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'O Vidura, Sanjaya hath come back. He hath gone away<br>after rebuking me. Tomorrow he will deliver, in the midst of the court,<br>Ajatasatru's message. I have not been able today to ascertain what the<br>message is of the Kuru hero. Therefore, my body is burning, and that hath<br>produced sleeplessness. Tell us what may be good for a person that is<br>sleepless and burning. Thou art, O child, versed in both religion and<br>profit. Ever since, Sanjaya hath returned from the Pandavas, my heart<br>knoweth no peace. Filled with anxiety about what he may deliver, all my<br>senses have been disordered'.<br><br>"Vidura said, 'Sleeplessness overtaketh thief, a lustful person, him that<br>hath lost all his wealth, him that hath failed to achieve success, and<br>him also that is weak and hath been attacked by a strong person. I hope,<br>O king, that none of these grave calamities have overtaken thee. I hope,<br>thou dost not grieve, coveting the wealth of others.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'I desire to hear from thee words that are<br>beneficial and fraught with high morality. In this race of royal Rishis<br>thou alone art reverenced by the wise.' Vidura replied, 'King<br>(Yudhishthira), graced with every virtue, is worthy of being the<br>sovereign of the three worlds; yet, O Dhritarashtra, however worthy of<br>being kept by thy side, he was exiled by thee. Thou art, however,<br>possessed of qualities which are thy very reverse of those possessed by<br>him. Although virtuous and versed in morality, thou hast yet no right to<br>a share in the kingdom owing to thy loss of sight. In consequence of his<br>inoffensiveness and kindness, his righteousness, love of truth and<br>energy, and his remembering the reverence that is due to thee,<br>Yudhishthira patiently bears innumerable wrongs. Having bestowed on<br>Duryodhana and Suvala's son and Karna, and Dussasana the management of<br>the empire, how canst thou hope for prosperity? He that is not served<br>from the high ends of life by the aid of self-knowledge, exertion,<br>forbearance and steadiness in virtue, is called wise. These again are the<br>marks of a wise man, viz., adherence to acts, worthy of praise and<br>rejection of what is blamable, faith, and reverence. He whom neither<br>anger nor joy, nor pride, nor false modesty, nor stupefaction, nor<br>vanity, can draw away from the high ends of life, is considered as wise.<br>He whose intended acts, and proposed counsels remain concealed from foes,<br>and whose acts become known only after they have been done, is considered<br>wise. He whose proposed actions are never obstructed by heat or cold,<br>fear of attachment, prosperity or adversity, is considered wise. He whose<br>judgment dissociated from desire, followeth both virtue and profit, and<br>who disregarding pleasure chooseth such ends as are serviceable in both<br>worlds, is considered wise. They that exert to the best of their might,<br>and act also to the best of their might, and disregard nothing as<br>insignificant, are called wise. He that understandeth quickly, listeneth<br>patiently, pursueth his objects with judgment and not from desire and<br>spendeth not his breath on the affairs of others without being asked, is<br>said to possess the foremost mark of wisdom. They that do not strive for<br>objects that are unattainable, that do not grieve for what is lost and<br>gone, that do not suffer their minds to be clouded amid calamities, are<br>regarded to possess intellects endued with wisdom. He who striveth,<br>having commenced anything, till it is completed, who never wasteth his<br>time, and who hath his soul under control, is regarded wise. They that<br>are wise, O bull of the Bharata race, always delight in honest deeds, do<br>what tendeth to their happiness and prosperity, and never sneer at what<br>is good. He who exulteth not at honours, and grieveth not at slights, and<br>remaineth cool and unagitated like a lake in the course of Ganga, is<br>reckoned as wise. That man who knoweth the nature of all creatures (viz.,<br>that everything is subject to destruction), who is cognisant also of the<br>connections of all acts, and who is proficient in the knowledge of the<br>means that men may resort to (for attaining their objects), is reckoned<br>as wise. He who speaketh boldly, can converse on various subjects,<br>knoweth the science of argumentation, possesseth genius, and can<br>interpret the meaning of what is writ in books, is reckoned as wise. He<br>whose studies are regulated by reason, and whose reason followeth the<br>scriptures, and who never abstaineth from paying respect to those that<br>are good, is called a wise man. He, on the other hand, who is ignorant of<br>scripture yet vain, poor yet proud, and who resorteth to unfair means for<br>the acquisition of his objects, is a fool. He who, forsaking his own,<br>concerneth himself with the objects of others, and who practiseth<br>deceitful means for serving his friends, is called a fool. He who wisheth<br>for those things that should not be desired, and forsaketh those that may<br>legitimately be desired, and who beareth malice to those that are<br>powerful, is regarded to be a foolish soul. He who regardeth his foe as<br>his friend, who hateth and beareth malice to his friend, and who<br>committeth wicked deeds, is said to be a person of foolish soul. O bull<br>of the Bharata race, he who divulgeth his projects, doubteth in all<br>things, and spendeth a long time in doing what requireth a short time, is<br>a fool. He who doth not perform the Sraddha for the Pitris, nor<br>worshippeth the deities, nor acquireth noble-minded friends, is said to<br>be a person of foolish soul. That worst of men who entereth a place<br>uninvited, and talketh much without being asked, and reposeth trust on<br>untrustworthy wights, is a fool. That man who being himself guilty<br>casteth the blame on others, and who though impotent giveth vent to<br>anger, is the most foolish of men. That man, who, without knowing his own<br>strength and dissociated from both virtue and profit, desireth an object<br>difficult of acquisition, without again adopting adequate means, is said<br>to be destitute of intelligence. O king, he who punisheth one that is<br>undeserving of punishment, payeth homage to persons without their<br>knowledge, and waiteth upon misers, is said to be of little sense. But he<br>that, having attained immense wealth and prosperity or acquired (vast)<br>learning, doth not bear himself haughtily, is reckoned as wise. Who,<br>again, is more heartless than he, who, though possessed of affluence,<br>eateth himself and weareth excellent robes himself without distributing<br>his wealth among his dependents? While one person committeth sins, many<br>reap the advantage resulting therefrom; (yet in the end) it is the doer<br>alone to whom the sin attacheth while those that enjoy the fruit escape<br>unhurt. When a bowman shooteth an arrow, he may or may not succeed in<br>slaying even a single person, but when an intelligent individual applieth<br>his intelligence (viciously); it may destroy an entire kingdom with the<br>king. Discriminating the two by means of the one, bring under thy<br>subjection the three by means of four, and also conquering the five and<br>knowing the six, and abstaining from the seven, be happy. Poison slayeth<br>but one person, and a weapon also but one; wicked counsels, however,<br>destroy an entire kingdom with king and subject. Alone one should not<br>partake of any savoury viand, nor alone reflect on concerns of profit,<br>nor alone go upon a journey, nor alone remain awake among sleeping<br>companions. That Being who is One without a second, and whom, O king,<br>thou hast not been able to comprehend, is Truth's self, and the Way to<br>heaven, even like a boat in the ocean. There is one only defect in<br>forgiving persons, and not another; that defect is that people take a<br>forgiving person to be weak. That defect, however, should not be taken<br>into consideration, for forgiveness is a great power. Forgiveness is a<br>virtue of the weak, and an ornament of the strong. Forgiveness subdueth<br>(all) in this world; what is there that forgiveness cannot achieve? What<br>can a wicked person do unto him who carrieth the sabre of forgiveness in<br>his hand? Fire falling on a grassless ground is extinguished of itself.<br>And unforgiving individual defileth himself with many enormities.<br>Righteousness is the one highest good; and forgiveness is the one supreme<br>peace; knowledge is one supreme contentment; and benevolence, one sole<br>happiness. Even as a serpent devoureth animals living in holes, the earth<br>devoureth these two, viz., a king who is incompetent to fight, and a<br>Brahmana who doth not sojourn to holy places. A man may attain renown in<br>this world by doing two things, viz., by refraining from harsh speech,<br>and by disregarding those that are wicked. O tiger among men, these two<br>have not a will of their own, viz., those women who covet men simply<br>because the latter are coveted by others of their sex, and that person<br>who worships another simply because the latter is worshipped by others.<br>These two are like sharp thorns afflicting the body, viz., the desires of<br>a poor man, and the anger of the impotent. These two persons never shine<br>because of their incompatible acts, viz., a householder without exertion,<br>and a beggar busied in schemes. These two, O king, live (as it were) in a<br>region higher than heaven itself, viz., a man of power endued with<br>forgiveness, and poor man that is charitable. Of things honestly got,<br>these two must be looked upon as misuse, viz., making gifts to the<br>unworthy and refusing the worthy. These two should be thrown into the<br>water, tightly binding weights to their necks, viz., a wealthy man that<br>doth not give away, and a poor man that is proud. These two, O tiger<br>among men, can pierce the orb itself of the sun, viz., a mendicant<br>accomplished in yoga, and a warrior that hath fallen in open fight. O<br>bull of the Bharata race, persons versed in the Vedas have said that<br>men's means are good, middling, and bad. Men also, O king, are good,<br>indifferent, and bad. They should, therefore, be respectively employed in<br>that kind of work for which they may be fit. These three, O king, cannot<br>have wealth of their own, viz., the wife, the slave, and the son, and<br>whatever may be earned by them would be his to whom they belong. Great<br>fear springeth from these three crimes, viz., theft of other's property,<br>outrage on other's wives, and breach with friend. These three, besides,<br>being destructive to one's own self, are the gates of hell, viz., lust,<br>anger, and covetousness. Therefore, every one should renounce them. These<br>three should never be forsaken even in imminent danger, viz., a follower,<br>one who seeks protection, saying,&#8212;I am thine,&#8212;and lastly one who hath<br>come to your abode. Verily, O Bharata, liberating a foe from distress,<br>alone amounteth in point of merit, to these three taken together, viz.,<br>conferring a boon, acquiring a kingdom, and obtaining a son. Learned men<br>have declared that a king, although powerful, should never consult with<br>these four, viz., men of small sense, men that are procrastinating, men<br>that are indolent, and men that are flatterers. O sire, crowned with<br>prosperity and leading the life of a householder, let these four dwell<br>with thee, viz., old consanguineous, relatives, high-born persons fallen<br>into adversity, poor friends, and issueless sisters. On being asked by<br>the chief of the celestials, Vrihaspati, O mighty king declared four<br>things capable of fructifying or occurring within a single day, viz., the<br>resolve of the gods, the comprehensions of intelligent persons, the<br>humility of learned men, and the destruction of the sinful. These four<br>that are calculated to remove fear, bring on fear when they are<br>improperly performed, viz., the Agni-hotra, the vow of silence, study,<br>and sacrifice (in general). O bull of the Bharata race, these five fires,<br>should be worshipped with regard by a person, viz., father, mother, fire<br>(proper), soul and preceptor. By serving these five, men attain great<br>fame in this world, viz., the gods, the Pitris, men, beggars, and guests.<br>These five follow thee wherever thou goest, viz., friends, foes, those<br>that are indifferent, dependants, and those that are entitled to<br>maintenance. Of the five senses beholding to man, if one springeth a<br>leak, then from that single hole runneth out all his intelligence, even<br>like water running out from a perforated leathern vessel. The six faults<br>should be avoided by a person who wisheth to attain prosperity, viz.,<br>sleep, drowsiness, fear, anger, indolence and procrastination. These six<br>should be renounced like a splitting vessel in the sea, viz., a preceptor<br>that cannot expound the scriptures, a priest that is illiterate, a king<br>that is unable to protect, a wife that speaketh disagreeable words, a<br>cow-herd that doth not wish to go to the fields, and a barber that<br>wisheth to renounce a village for the woods. Verily, those six qualities<br>should never be forsaken by men, viz., truth, charity, diligence,<br>benevolence, forgiveness and patience. These six are instantly destroyed,<br>if neglected, viz., kine, service, agriculture, a wife, learning, and the<br>wealth of a Sudra. These six forget those who have bestowed obligations<br>on them, viz., educated disciples, their preceptors; married persons,<br>their mothers; persons whose desires have been gratified, women; they who<br>have achieved success, they who had rendered aid; they who have crossed a<br>river, the boat (that carried them over); and patients that have been<br>cured, their physicians. Health, unindebtedness, living at home,<br>companionship with good men, certainty as regards the means of<br>livelihood, and living without fear, these six. O king, conduce to the<br>happiness of men. These six are always miserable, viz., the envious, the<br>malicious, the discontented, the irascible, the ever-suspicious, and<br>those depending upon the fortunes of others. These six, O king, comprise<br>the happiness of men, viz., acquirement of wealth, uninterrupted health,<br>a beloved and a sweet-speeched wife, an obedient son, and knowledge that<br>is lucrative. He that succeedeth in gaining the mastery over the six that<br>are always present in the human heart, being thus the master of his<br>senses, never committeth sin, and therefore suffereth calamity. These six<br>may be seen to subsist upon other six, viz., thieves, upon persons that<br>are careless; physicians, on persons that are ailing; women, upon persons<br>suffering from lust; priests, upon them that sacrifice; a king, upon<br>persons that quarrel; and lastly men of learning, upon them that are<br>without it. A king should renounce these seven faults that are productive<br>of calamity, inasmuch as they are able to effect the ruin of even<br>monarchs firmly established; these are women, dice, hunting, drinking,<br>harshness of speech, severity of punishment, and misuse of wealth. These<br>eight are the immediate indications of a man destined to destruction,<br>viz., hating the Brahmanas, disputes with Brahmanas, appropriation of a<br>Brahmana's possessions, taking the life of Brahmana, taking a pleasure in<br>reviling Brahmanas, grieving to hear the praises of Brahmanas, forgetting<br>them on ceremonious occasions, and giving vent to spite when they ask for<br>anything. These transgressions a wise man should understand, and<br>understanding, eschew. These eight, O Bharata, are the very cream of<br>happiness, and these only are attainable here, viz., meeting with<br>friends, accession of immense wealth, embracing a son, union for<br>intercourse, conversation with friends in proper times, the advancement<br>of persons belong to one's own party, the acquisition of what had been<br>anticipated, and respect in society. These eight qualities glorify a man,<br>viz., wisdom, high birth, self-restraint, learning, prowess, moderation<br>in speech gift according to one's power, and gratitude. This house hath<br>nine doors, three pillars, and five witnesses. It is presided over by the<br>soul. That learned man who knoweth all this is truly wise. O<br>Dhritarashtra, these ten do not know what virtue is viz., the<br>intoxicated, inattentive, the raving, the fatigued, the angry, the<br>starving, the hasty, the covetous, the frightened, and the lustful.<br>Therefore, he that is wise must eschew the company of these. In this<br>connection is cited the old story about what transpired between Suyodhana<br>and (Prahlada), the chief of the Asuras in relation to the latter's son.<br>That king who renounceth lust and anger, who bestoweth wealth upon proper<br>recipients, and is discriminating, learned, and active, is regarded as an<br>authority of all men. Great prosperity attends upon that king who knoweth<br>how to inspire confidence in others, who inflicteth punishment on those<br>whose guilt hath been proved, who is acquainted with the proper measure<br>of punishment, and who knoweth when mercy is to be shown. He is a wise<br>person who doth not disregard even a weak foe; who proceeds with<br>intelligence in respect of a foe, anxiously watching for an opportunity;<br>who doth not desire hostilities with persons stronger than himself; and<br>who displayeth his prowess in season. That illustrious person who doth<br>not grieve when a calamity hath already come upon him, who exerteth with<br>all his senses collected, and who patiently beareth misery in season, is<br>certainly the foremost of persons, and all his foes are vanquished. He<br>who doth not live away from hope uselessly, who doth not make friends<br>with sinful persons, who never outrageth another's wife, who never<br>betrayeth arrogance, and who never committeth a theft or showeth<br>ingratitude or indulgeth in drinking is always happy. He who never<br>boastfully striveth to attain the three objects of human pursuit, who<br>when asked, telleth the truth, who quarreleth not even for the sake of<br>friends, and who never becometh angry though slighted, is reckoned as<br>wise. He who beareth not malice towards others but is kind to all, who<br>being weak disputeth not with others, who speaketh not arrogantly, and<br>forgeteth a quarrel, is praised everywhere. That man who never assumeth a<br>haughty mien, who never censureth others praising himself the while, and<br>never addresseth harsh words to others for getting himself, is ever loved<br>by all. He who raketh not up old hostilities, who behaveth neither<br>arrogantly nor with too much humility, and who even when distressed never<br>committeth an improper act, is considered by respectable men a person of<br>good conduct. He who exulteth not at his own happiness, nor delighteth in<br>another's misery, and who repenteth not after having made a gift, is said<br>to be a man of good nature and conduct. He who desireth to obtain a<br>knowledge of the customs of different countries, and also the languages<br>of different nations, and of the usages of different orders of men,<br>knoweth at once all that is high and low; and wherever he may go, he is<br>sure to gain an ascendancy over even those that are glad. The intelligent<br>man who relinquisheth pride, folly, insolence, sinful acts, disloyalty<br>towards the king, crookedness of behaviour, enmity with many, and also<br>quarrels with men that are drunk, mad and wicked, is the foremost of his<br>species. The very gods bestow prosperity upon him who daily practiseth<br>self-restraint, purification, auspicious rites, worship of the gods,<br>expiatory ceremonies, and other rites of universal observance. The acts<br>of that learned man are well-conceived, and well-applied who formeth<br>matrimonial alliances with persons of equal positions and not with those<br>that are inferior, who placeth those before him that are more qualified,<br>and who talketh, behaveth and maketh friendships with persons of equal<br>position. He who eateth frugally after dividing the food amongst his<br>dependants, who sleepeth little after working much, and who, when<br>solicited giveth away even unto his foes, hath his soul under control,<br>and calamities always keep themselves aloof from him. He whose counsels<br>are well-kept and well-carried out into practice, and whose acts in<br>consequence thereof are never known by others to injure men, succeedeth<br>in securing even his most trifling objects. He who is intent upon<br>abstaining from injury to all creatures, who is truthful, gentle,<br>charitable, and pure in mind, shineth greatly among his kinsmen like a<br>precious gem of the purest ray having its origin in an excellent mine.<br>That man who feeleth shame even though his faults be not known to any<br>save himself, is highly honoured among all men. Possessed of a pure heart<br>and boundless energy and abstracted within himself, he shineth in<br>consequence of his energy like the very sun. King Pandu consumed by a<br>(Brahmana's) curse, had five sons born unto him in the woods that are<br>like five Indras. O son of Ambika, thou hast brought up those children<br>and taught them everything. They are obedient to thy commands. Giving<br>them back their just share of the kingdom, O sire, filled with joy, be<br>thou happy with thy sons. Then, O monarch, thou shalt inspire confidence<br>in both the gods and men.'"
