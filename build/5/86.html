                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'O Vidura, Janardana hath set out from Upaplavya. He<br>is now staying at Vrikasthala and will come here tomorrow. Janardana is<br>the leader of the Ahukas, the foremost person amongst all the members of<br>the Sattwata race, is high-souled, and endued with great energy and great<br>might. Indeed, Madhava is the guardian and protector of the Prosperous<br>kingdom of Vrishnis and is the illustrious Great-Grandsire of even the<br>three worlds. The Vrishnis adore the wisdom of the intelligent Krishna,<br>even as the Adityas, the Vasus, and the Rudras adore the wisdom of<br>Vrihaspati. O virtuous one, I will in thy presence, offer worship unto<br>that illustrious scion of Dasarha's race. Listen to me about that<br>worship. I will give him sixteen cars made of gold, each drawn by four<br>excellent and well-adorned steeds of uniform colour and of the Vahlika<br>breed. O Kaurava, I will give him eight elephants with temporal juice<br>always trickling down and tusks as large as poles of ploughs, capable of<br>smiting hostile ranks, and each having eight human attendants. I will<br>give him a century of handsome maid-servants of the complexion of gold,<br>all virgins, and man-servants I will give him as, many. I will give him<br>eighteen thousand woolen blankets soft to the touch, all presented to us<br>by the hill-men. I will also give him a thousand deer-skins brought from<br>China and other things of the kind that may be worthy of Kesava. I will<br>also give him this serene gem of the purest rays that shines day and<br>night, for Kesava alone deserves it. This car of mine drawn by mules that<br>makes a round of full fourteen Yojanas a day, I will also give him. I<br>will place before him every-day-provisions eight times greater than what<br>is necessary for the animals and attendants that form his train. Mounted<br>on their cars, having their person well-adorned, all my sons and<br>grandsons, save Duryodhana, will go out to receive him. And thousands of<br>graceful and well-decked dancing girls will go out on foot to receive the<br>illustrious Kesava. And the beautiful girls that will go out of the town<br>for receiving Janardana will go out unveiled. Let all the citizens with<br>their wives and children behold the illustrious slayer of Madhu wit h as<br>much respect and devotion as they show when casting their eyes on the<br>morning sun. Let the canopy all round, at my command, be crowded with<br>pendants and banners, and let the road, by which Kesava will come, be<br>well-watered and its dusts removed. Let Dussasana's abode, which is<br>better than Duryodhana's, be cleansed and well-adorned without delay.<br>That mansion consisting of many beautiful buildings, is pleasant and<br>delightful, and abounds with the wealth of all seasons. It is in that<br>abode that all my wealth, as also Duryodhana's, are deposited. Let all<br>that scion of the Vrishni race deserves be given unto him.'"
