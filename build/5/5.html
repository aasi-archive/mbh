                            "Krishna said, 'These worlds are worthy of the chief of the Somaka tribe,<br>and are calculated to promote the interests of Pandu's son of<br>immeasurable strength. As we are desirous of adopting a politic course,<br>this is, no doubt, our first duty; a man acting otherwise would be a<br>great fool. But our relationship to both the Kurus and the Pandus is<br>equal, howsoever these two parties may behave with each other. Both you<br>and we have been invited here on the occasion of a marriage. The marriage<br>having now been celebrated, let us go home well-pleased. You are the<br>foremost of kings, both in years and learning; and here we all, no doubt<br>are as if your pupils. Dhritarashtra has always entertained a great<br>respect for you; and you are also a friend of the preceptors Drona and<br>Kripa. I, therefore, ask you to send a message (to the Kurus) in the<br>interests of the Pandavas. We all resolve even upon this that you should<br>send a message unto them. If that chief of the Kuru race should make<br>peace on equitable terms, then the brotherly feelings between the Kuras<br>and the Pandus will sustain no injury. If on the other hand, the son of<br>Dhritarashtra should wax haughty and from folly refuse to make peace,<br>then, having summoned others, summon us too. The holder of Gadiva then<br>will be fired with wrath and the dull-headed and wicked Duryodhana, with<br>his partisans and friends, will meet his fate.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'King Virata, then having honoured Krishna, sent him<br>home with his followers and relatives. And after Krishna had set out for<br>Dwaraka, Yudhishthira and his followers, with king Virata, began to make<br>preparations for war. And Virata and his relatives sent word to all the<br>monarchs, and king Drupada also did the same. And at the request of those<br>lions of the Kuru race, as also of the two kings of the Matsyas and the<br>Panchalas, many lords of the earth possessed of great strength, came to<br>the place with cheerful hearts. And when the sons of Dhritarashtra heard<br>that the Pandavas had collected a large army, they also assembled many<br>rulers of the earth. And, O king, at that time the whole land became<br>thronged with the rulers of the earth who were marching to espouse the<br>cause of either the Kurus or the Pandavas. And the land was full of<br>military bands composed of four kinds of forces. And from all sides the<br>forces began to pour in. And the goddess Earth with her mountains and<br>forests seemed to tremble beneath their tread. And the king of the<br>Panchalas, having consulted the wishes of Yudhishthira, despatched to the<br>Kurus his own priest, who was old both in years and understanding.'
