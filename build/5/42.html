                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Then the illustrious and wise king Dhritarashtra,<br>having applauded the words spoken by Vidura, questioned Sanat-sujata in<br>secret, desirous of obtaining the highest of all knowledge. And the king<br>questioned the Rishi saying, 'O Sanat-sujata, I hear that thou art of the<br>opinion that there is no Death. Again it is said that the gods and the<br>Asuras, practise ascetic austerities in order to avoid death. Of these<br>two opinions, then, which is true?'<br><br>"Sanat-sujata said, 'Some say, death is avertable by particular acts;<br>others' opinion there is no death; thou hast asked me which of these is<br>true. Listen to me, O king, as I discourse to thee on this, so that thy<br>doubts may be removed. Know, O Kshatriya, that both of these are true.<br>The learned are of opinion that death results from ignorance. I say that<br>ignorance is Death, and so the absence of ignorance (Knowledge) is<br>immortality. It is from ignorance that the Asuras became subject to<br>defeat and death, and it is from the absence of ignorance that the gods<br>have attained the nature of Brahman. Death doth not devour creatures like<br>a tiger; its form itself is unascertainable. Besides this, some imagine<br>Yama to be Death. This, however, is due to the weakness of the mind. The<br>pursuit of Brahman or self-knowledge is immortality. That (imaginary) god<br>(Yama) holdeth his sway in the region of the Pitris, being the source of<br>bliss to the virtuous and of woe to the sinful. It is at his command that<br>death in the form of wrath, ignorance, and covetousness, occurreth among<br>men. Swayed by pride, men always walk in unrighteous path. None amongst<br>them succeeds in attaining to his real nature. With their understanding<br>clouded, and themselves swayed by there passions, they cast off their<br>bodies and repeatedly fall into hell. They are always followed by their<br>senses. It is for this that ignorance receives the name of death. Those<br>men that desire the fruits of action when the time cometh for enjoying<br>those fruits, proceed to heaven, casting off their bodies. Hence they<br>cannot avoid death. Embodied creatures, from inability to attain the<br>knowledge of Brahman and from their connection with earthly enjoyments,<br>are obliged to sojourn in a cycle of re-births, up and down and around,<br>The natural inclination of man towards pursuits that are unreal is alone<br>the cause of the senses being led to error. The soul that is constantly<br>affected by the pursuit of objects that are unreal, remembering only that<br>with which it is always engaged, adoreth only earthly enjoyments that<br>surround it. The desire of enjoyments first killeth men. Lust and wrath<br>soon follow behind it. These three, viz., the desire of enjoyments, lust,<br>and wrath, lead foolish men to death. They, however, that have conquered<br>their souls, succeed by self-restraint, to escape death. He that hath<br>conquered his soul without suffering himself to be excited by his<br>ambitious desire, conquereth these, regarding them as of no value, by the<br>aid of self-knowledge. Ignorance, assuming the form of Yama, cannot<br>devour that learned man who controlled his desires in this manner. That<br>man who followeth his desires is destroyed along with his desires. He,<br>however, that can renounce desire, can certainly drive away all kinds of<br>woe. Desire is, indeed, ignorance and darkness and hell in respect of all<br>creatures, for swayed by it they lose their senses. As intoxicated<br>persons in walking along a street reel towards ruts and holes, so men<br>under the influence of desire, misled by deluding joys, run towards<br>destruction. What can death do to a person whose soul hath not been<br>confounded or misled by desire? To him, death hath no terrors, like a<br>tiger made of straw. Therefore, O Kshatriya, if the existence of desire,<br>which is ignorance, is to be destroyed, no wish, not even the slightest<br>one, is either to be thought of or pursued. That soul, which is in thy<br>body, associated as it is with wrath and covetousness and filled with<br>ignorance, that is death. Knowing that death arises in this way, he that<br>relies on knowledge, entertaineth no fear of death. Indeed, as the body<br>is destroyed when brought under the influence of death, so death itself<br>is destroyed when it comes under the influence of knowledge.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'The Vedas declare the emancipating capacity of<br>those highly sacred and eternal regions, that are said to be obtainable<br>by the regenerate classes by prayers and sacrifices. Knowing this, why<br>should not a learned person have recourse to (religious) acts?'[3]<br><br>"Sanat-sujata said, 'Indeed, he that is without knowledge proceedeth<br>thither by the path indicated by thee, and the Vedas also declare that<br>thither are both bliss and emancipation. But he that regardeth the<br>material body to be self, if he succeeds in renouncing desire, at once<br>attaineth emancipation (or Brahman). If, however, one seeketh<br>emancipation without renouncing desire, one must have to proceed along<br>the (prescribed) route of action, taking care to destroy the chances of<br>his retracing the routes that he hath once passed over.'[4]<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Who is it that urgeth that Unborn and Ancient One?<br>If, again, it is He that is all this Universe in consequence of His<br>having entered everything (without desire as He is) what can be His<br>action, or his happiness? O learned sage, tell me all this truly.'[5]<br><br>"Sanat-sujata said, 'There is great objection in completely identifying<br>(as here) the two that are different Creatures always spring from the<br>union of Conditions (with what in its essence is without Conditions).<br>This view doth not detract from the supremacy of the Unborn and the<br>Ancient One. As for men, they also originate in the union of Conditions.<br>All this that appears is nothing but that everlasting Supreme Soul.<br>Indeed, the universe is created by the Supreme Soul itself undergoing<br>transformations. The Vedas to attribute this power (of<br>self-transformation) to the Supreme Soul. For the identity, again, of the<br>power and its possessor, both the Vedas and others are the authority.'[6]<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'In this world, some practise virtue, and some<br>renounce action or Karma (adopting what is called Sannyasa Yoga).<br>(Respecting those that practise virtue) I ask, is virtue competent to<br>destroy vice, or is it itself destroyed by vice?'<br><br>"Sanat-sujata said, 'The fruits of virtue and of (perfect) inaction are<br>both serviceable in that respect (i.e., for procuring emancipation).<br>Indeed, both are sure means for the attainment of emancipation. The man,<br>however, that is wise, achieveth success by knowledge (inaction). On the<br>other hand, the materialist acquireth merit (by action) and (as the<br>consequence thereof) emancipation. He hath also (in course of his<br>pursuit) to incur sin. Having obtained again fruits of both virtue and<br>vice which are transitory, (heaven having its end as also hell in respect<br>of the virtuous and the sinful), the man of action becometh once more<br>addicted to action as the consequence of his own previous virtues and<br>vices. The man of action, however, who possesseth intelligence,<br>destroyeth his sins by his virtuous acts. Virtue, therefore, is strong,<br>and hence the success of the man of action.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Tell me, according to their gradation, of those<br>eternal regions that are said to be attainable, as the fruits of their<br>own virtuous acts, by regenerate persons, engaged in the practice of<br>virtue. Speak unto me of others' regions also of a similar kind. O<br>learned sire, I do not wish to hear of actions (towards which man's heart<br>naturally inclineth, however interdicted or sinful they may be).'<br><br>"Sanat-sujata said, 'Those regenerate persons that take pride in their<br>Yoga practices, like strong men in their own strength, departing hence,<br>shine in the region of Brahman. Those regenerate persons that proudly<br>exert in performing sacrifices and other Vedic rites, as the fruit of<br>that knowledge which is theirs, in consequence of those acts, freed from<br>this world, proceed to that region which is the abode of the deities.<br>There are others, again, conversant with the Vedas, who are of opinion<br>that the performance of the sacrifices and rites (ordained by the Vedas)<br>is obligatory (their non-performance being sinful). Wedded to external<br>forms, though seeking the development of the inner self (for they<br>practise these rites for only virtue's sake and not for the<br>accomplishment of particular aims), these persons should not be regarded<br>very highly (although some respect should be theirs). Wherever, again,<br>food and drink worthy of a Brahmana are abundant, like grass and reeds in<br>a spot during the rainy season, there should the Yogin seek for his<br>livelihood (without afflicting the householder of scanty means); by no<br>means should he afflict his own self by hunger and thirst. In a place,<br>where there may be both inconvenience and danger to one, for one's<br>aversion, to disclose one's superiority, he that doth not proclaim his<br>superiority is better than he that doth. The food offered by that person<br>who is not pained at the sight of another disclosing his superiority, and<br>who never eateth without offering the prescribed share to Brahmanas and<br>guests, is approved by the righteous. As a dog oftentimes devoureth its<br>own evacuations to its injury, so those Yogins devour their own vomit who<br>procure their livelihood by disclosing their pre-eminence. The wise know<br>him for a Brahmana, who, living in the midst of kindred, wishes his<br>religious practices to remain always unknown to them. What other Brahmana<br>deserveth to know the Supreme Soul, that is unconditioned, without<br>attributes, unchangeable, one and alone, and without duality of any kind?<br>In consequence of such practices, a Kshatriya can know the Supreme Soul<br>and behold it in his own soul. He that regardeth the Soul to be the<br>acting and feeling Self,&#8212;what sins are not committed by that thief who<br>robbeth the soul of its attributes? A Brahmana should be without<br>exertion, should never accept gifts, should win the respect of the<br>righteous, should be quiet, and though conversant with the Vedas should<br>seem to be otherwise, for then only may he attain to knowledge and know<br>Brahman. They that are poor in earthly but rich in heavenly wealth and<br>sacrifices, become unconquerable and fearless, and they should be<br>regarded as embodiments of Brahman. That person even, in this world, who<br>(by performing sacrifices) succeedeth in meeting with the gods that<br>bestow all kinds of desirable objects (on performers of sacrifices), is<br>not equal to him that knoweth Brahman for the performer of sacrifices<br>hath to undergo exertions (while he that knoweth Brahman attaineth to Him<br>without such exertions). He was said to be really honoured, who,<br>destitute of actions, is honoured by the deities. He should never regard<br>himself as honoured who is honoured by others. One should not, therefore,<br>grieveth when one is not honoured by others. People act according to<br>their nature just as they open and shut their eyelids; and it is only the<br>learned that pay respect to others. The man that is respected should<br>think so. They again, in this world, that are foolish, apt to sin, and<br>adepts in deceit, never pay respect to those that are worthy of respect;<br>on the other hand, they always show disrespect to such persons. The<br>world's esteem and asceticism (practices of Mauna), can never exist<br>together. Know that this world is for those that are candidates for<br>esteem, while the other world is for those that are devoted to<br>asceticism. Here, in this world, O Kshatriya, happiness (the world's<br>esteem) resides in worldly prosperity. The latter, however, is an<br>impediment (to heavenly bliss). Heavenly prosperity, on the other hand,<br>is unattainable by one that is without true wisdom. The righteous say<br>that there are various kinds of gates, all difficult of being guarded,<br>for giving access to the last kind of prosperity. These are truth,<br>uprightness, modesty, self-control, purity of mind and conduct and<br>knowledge (of the Vedas). These six are destructive of vanity and<br>ignorance.'"
