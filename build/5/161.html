                            (Uluka Dutagamana Parva)<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'After the high-souled Pandavas, O king, had encamped by<br>the side of the Hiranwati, the Kauravas also fixed their camps. And king<br>Duryodhana having strongly posted his troops and paid homage to all the<br>kings (on his side) and planted outposts and bodies of soldiers for the<br>protection of warriors, summoned those rulers of men, viz., Karna and<br>Dussasana and Sakuni, the son of Suvala, and began O Bharata, to consult<br>with them. And king Duryodhana, O Bharata, having (first) consulted with<br>Karna, and (next), O monarch, with Karna and his (own) brother Dussasana,<br>and Suvala's son all together, then summoned, O bull among men, Uluka and<br>bringing him into his presence in private, told him, O king, these words,<br>'O Uluka, O son of an adept at dice, repair thou unto the Pandavas and<br>the Somakas. And repairing thither, repeat these my words (unto<br>Yudhishthira) in the hearing of Vasudeva. That terrible battle between<br>the Kurus and the Pandavas which had been expected from a long time back<br>has, at last come. Those boastful words which Sanjaya brought to me, in<br>the midst of the Kurus and which thou hadst, with Vasudeva and thy<br>younger brothers, uttered in deep roar,&#8212;the time, O son of Kunti, hath<br>at last come for making them good. Do ye achieve, therefore, all which ye<br>have pledged yourselves to achieve. Unto the eldest son of Kunti thou<br>must say, as my words, the following, 'Virtuous as thou art, how canst<br>then, with all thy brothers, with the Somakas, and the Kekayas, set thy<br>heart upon unrighteousness? How canst thou wish the destruction of the<br>universe, when, as I think thou shouldst be the dispeller of the fears of<br>all creatures. O bull of Bharata's race, this sloka sung of old by<br>Prahlada when his kingdom had been wrested from him by the gods, hath<br>been heard by us,&#8212;Ye gods, that person whose standard of righteousness<br>is always up, but whose sins are always concealed is said to adopt the<br>behaviour of the cat (in the story).' I will here repeat to thee, O king,<br>this excellent story recited by Narada to my father. A wicked cat, O<br>king, once on a time took up his abode on the banks of the Ganges,<br>abandoning all work and with his hands upraised (after the manner of a<br>devotee). Pretending to have purified his heart, he said unto all<br>creatures these words, for inspiring confidence in them, viz.,&#8212;I am now<br>practising virtue. After a long time, all oviparous creatures reposed<br>trust in him, and coming unto him all together, O monarch, they all<br>applauded that cat. And worshipped by all feathery creatures, that<br>devourer of feathery creatures, regarded his purpose already<br>accomplished, as also the purpose of his austerities. And after some more<br>time, the mice went to that place. And these also all beheld him to be a<br>virtuous person engaged in the observance of vows, and proudly exerting<br>himself in a grand act. And having arrived at that settled conviction,<br>they entertained the following wish, O king,&#8212;'Many foes we have. Let<br>this one, therefore, become our maternal uncle, and let him always<br>protect all the old and young ones of our race. And going at last to the<br>cat, all of them said, 'Through thy grace we desire to roam in happiness.<br>Thou art our gracious shelter, thou art our great friend. For this, all<br>of us place ourselves under thy protection. Thou art always devoted to<br>virtue, thou art always engaged in the acquisition of virtue. O thou of<br>great wisdom, protect us, therefore, like the wielder of the thunderbolt<br>protecting the celestials.' Thus addressed, O king, by all the mice, the<br>cat answered them, saying, 'I do not see the consistency of these two,<br>viz., my ascetic pursuits and this protection (that I am called upon to<br>grant). I cannot avoid, however, doing good to you agreeably to your<br>request. You all, at the same time, should always obey my words. Staying<br>as I am in the observance of a severe vow, I am weakened by my ascetic<br>practices. I do not, therefore, see the means of my moving from place to<br>place. Ye all should, therefore, bear me hence every day to the<br>river-side.' Saying, 'So be it,' the mice then, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>made over all their old and young ones to that cat. Then that sinful<br>creature of wicked soul, feeding on mice, gradually became fat and of<br>good complexion and strong in his limbs. And thus while the mice began to<br>be reduced in number, the cat began to grow in vigour and strength. Then<br>all the mice, coming together, said unto one another, 'Our uncle is daily<br>growing stout, while we are being daily reduced (in number)!' Then a<br>certain mouse endued with wisdom, named Dindika, said, O king these words<br>unto the large swarm of mice gathered there, 'Go all of ye to the<br>river-side together. I will follow ye, accompanying our uncle.'<br>'Excellent, Excellent,' they said, and applauded that one of their<br>number. And they all did just as those words of grave import spoken by<br>Dindika seemed to indicate. The cat, however, not knowing all this, ate<br>up Dindika that day. All the mice then, without losing much time, began<br>to take counsel of one another. Then a very old mouse, named Kilika, said<br>these just words, O king, in the presence of all his kinsfolk, 'Our uncle<br>is not really desirous of earning virtue. He hath, like a hypocrite,<br>become our friend when in reality he is our enemy. Indeed, the excreta of<br>a creature that liveth only upon fruits and roots never containeth hair<br>of fur. Then again, while his limbs are growing, our number is decaying.<br>Besides, Dindika cannot be seen for these eight days.' Hearing these<br>words, the mice ran away in all directions. And that cat also of wicked<br>soul returned to whence he came. O thou of wicked soul, thou too art a<br>practiser of such feline behaviour. Thou behavest towards thy kinsmen<br>after the manner of the cat (in the story) towards the mice. Thy speech<br>is of one kind, and thy conduct is of another. Thy (devotion to)<br>scripture and thy peacefulness of behaviour are only for display before<br>men. Giving up this hypocrisy, O king, adopt the practices of a Kshatriya<br>and do all that one should do as such. Art thou not virtuous, O bull<br>among men? Acquiring the earth by means of the prowess of thy arms, make<br>gifts, O best of the Bharatas, unto the Brahmanas and to the means of thy<br>deceased ancestors as one should. Seeking the good of that mother of<br>thine who hath been afflicted with distress for a series of years, dry up<br>her tears, and confer honours on her by vanquishing (thy foes) in battle.<br>Thou hadst with great abjectness, solicited only five villages. Even that<br>was rejected by us, for how could we bring about a battle, how could we<br>succeed in angering the Pandavas, was all that we sought. Remembering<br>that it was for thee that the wicked Vidura was driven (by us) and that<br>we had tried to burn you all in the house of lac, be a man now; at the<br>time of Krishna's setting out (from Upaplavya) for the Kuru court, thou<br>hadst through him communicated this message (to us), viz.,&#8212;Hear, O king,<br>I am prepared for either war or peace! Know, O monarch, that the hour<br>hath come for battle. O Yudhishthira, I have made all these preparations<br>in view of that. What doth a Kshatriya regard as a more estimable<br>accession (of good fortune) than battle? Born thou hast beer in the<br>Kshatriya order. Known also thou art in the world. Having obtained<br>weapons again from Drona and Kripa, why, O bull of the Bharata race, dost<br>thou rely on Vasudeva who belongeth to the same order of life as thyself<br>and who is, not superior to thee in might.'<br><br>'Thou must also say unto Vasudeva in the presence of the Pandavas these<br>words,&#8212;For thy own sake, as also for the sake of the Pandavas, withstand<br>me in battle to the best of thy power! Assuming once more that form which<br>thou hadst assumed before in the Kuru court, rush thou with Arjuna<br>against me (on the field)! A conjuror's tricks or illusions may<br>(sometimes) inspire fright. But as regards the person that stands armed<br>for fight, such deceptions (instead of inspiring fight) only provoke<br>anger! We also are competent, by our powers of illusion, to ascend to<br>heaven or the firmament, or penetrate into the nether region, or the city<br>of Indra! We also can display various forms in our own body! The great<br>Ordainer bringeth all creatures to subjection by a flat of His will (and<br>never by such conjuror's tricks)! Thou always sayest, O thou of Vrishni's<br>race, these words, viz.,&#8212;Causing the sons of Dhritarashtra to be slain<br>in battle, I will confer undisputed sovereignty on the sons of<br>Pritha!&#8212;These words of thine were brought to me by Sanjaya. Thou hadst<br>also said, 'Know, ye Kauravas that it is with Arjuna, having me for his<br>second, ye have provoked hostilities!' Truthfully adhering to that<br>pledge, put forth thy energy for the Pandavas and fight now in battle to<br>the best of thy power! Show us that thou canst be a man! He is said to be<br>truly alive, who, having ascertained (the wight of his) foes inspireth<br>grief in them by resorting to true manliness! Without any reason, O<br>Krishna, great hath been thy fame spread in the world! It will, however,<br>presently be known that there are many persons, in the world that are<br>really eunuchs though possessed of the signs of manhood. A slave of<br>Kansa, especially as thou art, a monarch like me should not cover himself<br>in mail against thee!<br><br>'Say (next) repeatedly, from me, O Uluka, unto that stupid, ignorant,<br>gluttonous Bhimasena, who is even like a bull though divested of horns,<br>these words, viz.,&#8212;O son of Pritha, a cook thou hadst become, known by<br>the name of Vallabha, in the city of Virata! All this is evidence of thy<br>manliness! Let not the vow thou hadst made before in the midst of the<br>Kuru court be falsified! Let Dussasana's blood be drunk if thou art able!<br>O son of Kunti, thou often sayest,&#8212;Speedily shall I slay Dhritarashtra's<br>sons in battle!&#8212;The time for accomplishing it hath now come! O Bharata,<br>thou deservest to be rewarded in cookery! The difference, however, is<br>very great between dressing food and fighting! Fight now, be a man!<br>Indeed, thou shalt have to lie down, deprived of life, on the earth,<br>embracing thy mace, O Bharata! The boast in which thou hadst indulged in<br>the midst of thy assembly is all vain, O Vrikodara!<br><br>'Say, O Uluka, unto Nakula, from me, these words, viz.,&#8212;Fight now, O<br>Bharata, patiently! We desire, O Bharata, to behold thy manliness, thy<br>reverence for Yudhishthira, and thy hatred of myself! Recall to mind the<br>sufferings in their entirety that Krishna had suffered!<br><br>'Next, thou must say these words of mine unto Sahadeva in the presence of<br>the (assembled) monarchs,&#8212;Fight in battle now, to the best of thy power!<br>Remember all your woes!<br><br>'Say next, from me, unto both Virata and Drupada, these words,<br>viz.,&#8212;Since the beginning of the creation, slaves, endued even with<br>great accomplishments, have never been able to fully understand their<br>masters. Nor have affluent kings been always able to understand their<br>slaves! This king deserveth no praise,&#8212;possibly, under such a belief, ye<br>have come against me! United together, fight ye, therefore, against me<br>for achieving my death, and accomplish the objects ye have in view, as<br>also those that the Pandavas have!<br><br>Say also, from me, unto Dhrishtadyumna, the prince of Panchalas, these<br>words, viz.,&#8212;The hour hath now come for thee, and thou also hast come<br>for thy hour! Approaching Drona in battle thou wilt know what is best for<br>thee! Achieve thou the business of thy friend! Accomplish that feat which<br>is difficult of accomplishment!<br><br>'Tell, next, repeatedly from me, O Uluka, unto Sikhandin, these words,<br>viz.,&#8212;The mighty-armed Kaurava, foremost of all bowmen, Ganga's son<br>(Bhishma), will not slay thee, knowing thee to be only a female! Fight<br>now without any fear! Achieve in battle what canst to the best of thy<br>power! We desire to behold thy prowess!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said this, king Duryodhana laughed<br>aloud. And addressing Uluka again, he said, 'Say once more unto<br>Dhananjaya in the bearing of Vasudeva these words, viz.,&#8212;O hero, either<br>vanquishing us rule thou this world, or vanquished by us lie thou down on<br>the field (deprived of life)! Recalling to thy mind the sufferings<br>occasioned by your banishment from the kingdom, the woes of your sojourn<br>in the woods, and 'he affliction of Krishna, be a man, O son of Pandu!<br>That for which a Kshatriya lady bringeth forth a son is now arrived!<br>Displaying, therefore, in battle, thy might, energy, courage, manliness,<br>and great dexterity and speed in the use of weapons, appease thy wrath!<br>Afflicted with woe, and dispirited and exiled (from home) for a long<br>time, and driven from his kingdom, who is there whose heart would not<br>break? Who is there, well-born, and brave, and uncovetous of other's<br>wealth, that would not have his wrath excited when his kingdom descending<br>from generation to generation is attacked? Realise in deeds those high<br>words that thou hadst said! One that only boasts without being able to do<br>anything is regarded as a worthless man by those that are good. Recover<br>thy kingdom and those possessions that are now owned by thy foes! Even<br>these two are the purposes which a person desirous of war hath in view.<br>Exert, therefore, thy manliness! Thou wert won (as a slave) at dice!<br>Krishna was caused by us to be brought into the assembly! One that<br>regardeth himself a man should certainly display his wrath at this! For<br>twelve long years hadst thou been exiled from home into the woods, and<br>one whole year hadst thou passed in Virata's service! Remembering the<br>pangs of banishment from the kingdom and of thy sojourn in the woods, as<br>also those which Krishna had suffered, be thou a man! Display thy wrath<br>towards those that repeatedly utter harsh words at thee and thy brothers!<br>indeed, wrath (such as that) would consist in manliness! Let thy anger,<br>thy might and prowess, and knowledge, and thy lightness of hand in the<br>use of weapons, be exhibited? Fight, O son of Pritha, and prove to be a<br>man! The incantations in respect of all thy weapons have been performed.<br>The field of Kurukshetra is free from mire. Thy steeds are hale and<br>strong. Thy soldiers have received their pay. With Kesava, therefore, as<br>(thy) second, fight (with us)! Without encountering Bhishma as yet, why<br>dost thou indulge in such boasts? Like a fool, who, without having<br>ascended the Gandhamadana mountains, boasts (of his would-be feat), thou,<br>O son of Kunti, art indulging in a similar bragging, be a man! Without<br>having vanquished in battle the invincible Karna of the Suta race, or<br>Salya, that foremost of persons, or Drona, the first of all mighty<br>warriors and equal unto the lord of Sachi in battle, how canst thou, O<br>Partha, covet for thy kingdom? He that is a preceptor of both Vedic lore<br>and bowmanship, he that hath crossed both those branches of learning, he<br>that is foremost in battle and imperturbable (as a tower), he whose might<br>knoweth no diminution, that commander of armies, Drona of great<br>effulgence,&#8212;him, O Partha, thou wishest in vain to conquer! It is never<br>heard that the Sumeru peak hath been crushed by the wind. Yet even the<br>wind will bear away Sumeru, heaven itself will fall down on the earth,<br>the very Yugas will be altered in respect of their course, if what thou<br>hast said unto me becometh true! What man is there, desirous of life, be<br>it Partha or any body else, who having approached that grinder of foes,<br>would be able to return home with sound body? What person is there,<br>treading upon the earth with his feet, who, encountered by Drona and<br>Bhishma and struck with their arrows, would escape from the battle with<br>life? Like a frog having its abode in a well, why art thou not able to<br>realise the might of this vast army of the assembled monarchs,<br>invincible, looking like the very celestial host, and protected by these<br>lords of men, as the heavenly host by the gods themselves,&#8212;protected<br>that is, by the kings of the East, the West, the South and the North, by<br>the Kamvojas, the Sakas, the Khasas, the Salwas, the Matsyas, the Kurus<br>of the middle country, the Mlechchhas, the Pulindas, the Dravidas, the<br>Andhras, and the Kanchis,&#8212;this host of many nations, ready for battle,<br>and resembling the uncrossable current of the Ganga. O thou of little<br>understanding, how canst thou, O fool, venture to fight with me when<br>stationed in the midst of my elephant-host? Thy inexhaustible quivers,<br>thy car given thee by Agni, and thy celestial banner, O Partha, will all,<br>O Bharata, be tested by us in battle! Fight, O Arjuna, without bragging!<br>Why dost thou indulge in too much boast! Success in battle resulteth from<br>the method in which it is fought. A battle is never gained by bragging.<br>If, O Dhananjaya, acts in this world succeeded in consequence of<br>vauntings, all persons would then have succeeded in their objects, for<br>who is there that is not competent to brag? I know that thou hast<br>Vasudeva for thy ally. I know that thy Gandiva is full six cubits long. I<br>know that there is no warrior equal to thee. Knowing all this, I retain<br>thy kingdom yet! A man never winneth success in consequence of the<br>attributes of lineage. It is the Supreme Ordainer alone who by his fiat<br>of will maketh things (hostile) friendly subservient. For these thirteen<br>years, I have enjoyed sovereignty while ye were weeping. I shall continue<br>to rule in the same way, slaying thee with thy kinsmen. Where was thy<br>Gandiva then, when thou wert made slave won at stake? Where, O Falguni,<br>was Bhima's might then? Your deliverance then came neither from<br>Bhimasena, armed with mace, nor from you armed with Gandiva, but from the<br>faultless Krishna. It was she, the daughter to Prishata's house, that<br>delivered you all, sunk in slavery, engaged in occupations worthy only of<br>the low, and working as servitors. I characterised you all as sesame<br>seeds without kernel. That is true. For, did not Partha (some time after)<br>bear a braid when living in Virata's city? In the cooking apartments of<br>Virata, Bhimasena was fatigued with doing the work of a cook. Even this,<br>O son of Pritha, is (evidence of) my manliness! Flying from an encounter<br>with hips and braids and waist-bands, thyself binding thy hair, wert<br>engaged in teaching the girls to dance? It is thus that Kshatriyas always<br>inflict punishment on Kshatriyas! From fear of Vasudeva, or from fear of<br>thyself, O Falguni, I will not give up the kingdom! Fight with Kesava as<br>thy ally! Neither deception, nor conjuror's tricks, nor jugglery, can<br>terrify the armed man addressed for fight. On the other hand, these<br>provoke only his wrath. A thousand Vasudevas, a hundred Falgunis,<br>approaching me whose arms and weapons never go for nothing, will surely<br>fly away in all directions. Encounter Bhishma in combat, or strike the<br>hill with thy head, or cross with the aid of thy two arms alone the vast<br>and deep main! As regards my army, it is a veritable main with Saradwat's<br>son as its large fish, Vivingsati as its huge snake, Bhishma as its<br>current of immeasurable might, Drona as its unconquerable alligator,<br>Karna and Salwa and Salya its fishes and whirlpools, the ruler of the<br>Kamvojas its equine head emitting fire, Vrihadvala its fierce waves,<br>Somadatta's son its whale, Yuyutsu and Durmarshana its waters, Bhagadatta<br>its gale, Srutayus and Hridika's son its gulfs and bays, Dussasana its<br>current, Sushena and Chitrayuda its water-elephants (hippopotamus) and<br>crocodile, Jayadratha its (submarine) rock, Purumitra its depth, and<br>Sakuni its shores! When having plunged into this surging ocean with its<br>inexhaustible waves of weapons, thou wilt, from fatigue, be deprived of<br>senses and have all thy relatives and friends slain, then will repentance<br>possess thy heart! Then also will thy heart turn away from the thought of<br>ruling the earth, like the heart of a person of impure deeds turning away<br>from (hope of) heaven. Indeed, for thee to win a kingdom to rule is as<br>impossible as for one not possessed of ascetic merit to obtain heaven!'"
