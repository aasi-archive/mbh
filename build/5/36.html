                            "Vidura said, 'In this connection is cited the old story of the discourse<br>between the son of Atri and the deities called Sadhyas is as heard by us.<br>In days of old, the deities known by the name of Sadhyas questioned the<br>highly wise and great Rishi of rigid vows (the son of Atri), while the<br>latter was wandering in the guise of one depending on eleemosynary<br>charity for livelihood. The Sadhyas said, 'We are, O great Rishi, deities<br>known as Sadhyas. Beholding thee, we are unable to guess who thou art. It<br>seemeth to us, however, that thou art possessed of intelligence and<br>self-control in consequence of acquaintance with the scriptures. It,<br>therefore, behoveth thee to discourse to us in magnanimous words fraught<br>with learning.' The mendicant Rishi answered, 'Ye immortals, it hath been<br>heard by me that by untying all the knots in the heart by the aid of<br>tranquillity, and by mastery over all the passions, and observance of<br>true religion, one should regard both the agreeable and the disagreeable<br>like his own self. One should not return the slanders or reproaches of<br>others for the pain that is felt by him who beareth silently, consumeth<br>the slanderer; and he that beareth, succeedeth also in appropriating the<br>virtues of the slanderer. Indulge not in slanders and reproaches. Do not<br>humiliate and insult others. Quarrel not with friends. Abstain from<br>companionship with those that are vile and low. Be not arrogant and<br>ignoble in conduct. Avoid words that are harsh and fraught with anger.<br>Harsh words burn and scorch the very vitals, bones, heart, and the very<br>sources of the life of men. Therefore, he, that is virtuous, should<br>always abstain from harsh and angry words. That worst of men is of harsh<br>and wrathful speech, who pierceth the vitals of others with wordy thorns,<br>beareth hell in his tongue, and should ever be regarded as a dispenser of<br>misery to men. The man that is wise, pierced by another's wordy arrows,<br>sharp-pointed and smarting like fire or the sun, should, even if deeply<br>wounded and burning with pain, bear them patiently remembering that the<br>slanderer's merits become his. He that waiteth upon one that is good or<br>upon one that is wicked, upon one that is possessed of ascetic merit or<br>upon one that is a thief, soon taketh the colour from that companion of<br>his, like a cloth from the dye in which it is soaked. The very gods<br>desire his company, who, stung with reproach, returneth if not himself<br>nor causeth others to return it, or who being struck doth not himself<br>return the blow nor causeth other to do it, and who wisheth not the<br>slightest injury to him that injureth him. Silence, it is said, is better<br>than speech, if speak you must, then it is better to say the truth; if<br>truth is to be said, it is better to say what is agreeable; and if what<br>is agreeable is to be said, then it is better to say what is consistent<br>with morality. A man becometh exactly like him with whom he liveth, or<br>like him whom he regardeth, or like that which he wisheth to be. One is<br>freed from those things from which one abstaineth, and if one abstaineth<br>from everything he hath not to suffer even the least misery. Such a man<br>neither vanquisheth others, nor is vanquished by others. He never<br>injureth nor opposeth others. He is unmoved by praise or blame. He<br>neither grieveth nor exalteth in joy. That man is regarded as the first<br>of his species who wisheth for the prosperity of all and never setteth<br>his heart on the misery of others, who is truthful in speech, humble in<br>behaviour, and hath all his passions under control. That man is regarded<br>as a mediocre in goodness who never consoleth others by saying what is<br>not true; who giveth having promise; and who keepeth an eye over the<br>weakness of others. These, however, are the indications of a bad man,<br>viz., incapacity to be controlled; liability to be afflicted by dangers;<br>proneness to give way to wrath, ungratefulness; inability to become<br>another's friend, and wickedness of heart. He too is the worst of men,<br>who is dissatisfied with any good that may come to him from others who is<br>suspicious of his own self, and who driveth away from himself all his<br>true friends. He that desireth prosperity to himself, should wait upon<br>them that are good, and at times upon them that are indifferent, but<br>never upon them that are bad. He that is wicked, earneth wealth, it is<br>true, by putting forth his strength, by constant effort, by intelligence,<br>and by prowess, but he can never win honest fame, nor can he acquire the<br>virtues and manners of high families (in any of which he may be born).'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'The gods, they that regard both virtue and profit<br>without swerving from either, and they that are possessed of great<br>learning, express a liking for high families. I ask thee, O Vidura, this<br>question,&#8212;what are those families that are called high?'<br><br>"Vidura said, 'Asceticism, self-restraint, knowledge of the Vedas,<br>sacrifices, pure marriages, and gifts of food,&#8212;those families in which<br>these seven exist or are practised duly, are regarded as high. There are<br>high families who deviate not from the right course whose deceased<br>ancestors are never pained (by witnessing the wrong-doings of their<br>descendants), who cheerfully practise all the virtues, who desire to<br>enhance the pure fame of the line in which they are born, and who avoid<br>every kind of falsehood. Families that are high, fall down and become low<br>owing to the absence of sacrifices, impure marriages, abandonment of the<br>Vedas, and insults offered to Brahmanas. High families fall off and<br>become low owing to their members disregarding or speaking ill of<br>Brahmanas, or to the misappropriation, O Bharata, of what had been<br>deposited with them by others. Those families that are possessed of<br>members, wealth and kine, are not regarded as families if they be wanting<br>in good manners and conduct, while families wanting in wealth but<br>distinguished by manners and good conduct are regarded as such and win<br>great reputation. Therefore, should good manners and good conduct be<br>maintained with care, for, as regards wealth, it cometh or goeth. He that<br>is wanting in wealth is not really wanting, but he that is wanting in<br>manners and conduct is really in want. Those families that abound in kine<br>and other cattle and in the produce of the field are not really worthy of<br>regard and fame if they be wanting in manners and conduct. Let none in<br>our race be a fomenter of quarrels, none serve a king as minister, none<br>steal the wealth of others, none provoke intestine dissensions, none be<br>deceitful or false in behaviour, and none eat before serving the Rishis,<br>the gods, and guests. He, in our race, who slayeth Brahmanas, or<br>entertaineth feelings of aversion towards them, or impedeth or otherwise<br>injureth agriculture, doth not deserve to mix with us. Straw (for a<br>seat), ground (for sitting upon), water (to wash the feet and face), and,<br>fourthly sweet words,&#8212;these are never wanting in the houses of the good.<br>Virtuous men devoted to the practice of righteous acts, when desirous of<br>entertaining (guests), have these things ready for being offered with<br>reverence. As the Sandal tree, O king, though thin, is competent to bear<br>weights which timbers of other trees (much thicker) cannot; so they that<br>belong to high families are always able to bear the weight of great cares<br>which ordinary men cannot. He is no friend whose anger inspireth fear, or<br>who is to be waited upon with fear. He, however, on whom one can repose<br>confidence as on a father, is a true friend. Other friendships are<br>nominal connection. He that beareth himself as a friend, even though<br>unconnected by birth of blood, is a true friend, a real refuge, and a<br>protector. He, whose heart is unsteady, or who doth not wait upon the<br>aged, or who is of a restless disposition cannot make friends. Success<br>(in the attainment of objects) forsaketh the person whose heart is<br>unsteady, or who hath no control over his mind, or who is a slave of his<br>senses, like swans forsaking a tank whose waters have dried up. They that<br>are of weak minds suddenly give way to anger and are gratified without<br>sufficient cause; they are like clouds that are so inconstant. The very<br>birds of prey abstain from touching the dead bodies of those who having<br>been served and benefited by friends, show ingratitude to the latter.<br>Beest thou poor or beest thou rich, thou shouldst honour thy friends.<br>Until some service is asked, the sincerity or otherwise of friends cannot<br>be known. Sorrow killeth beauty; sorrow killeth strength; sorrow killeth<br>the understanding; and sorrow bringeth on disease. Grief, instead of<br>helping the acquisition of his object, drieth up the body, and maketh<br>one's foes glad. Therefore, do not yield to grief, Men repeatedly die and<br>are reborn; repeatedly they wither away and grow; repeatedly they ask<br>others for help, and they themselves are asked for help; repeatedly they<br>lament and are lamented. Happiness and misery, plenty and want, gain and<br>loss, life and death, are shared by all in due order. Therefore, he that<br>is self-controlled should neither exult in joy nor repine in sorrow. The<br>six senses are always restless. Through the most predominant one amongst<br>them one's understanding escapeth in proportion to the strength it<br>assumes, like water from a pot through its holes.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'King Yudhishthira who is like a flame of fire, has<br>been deceived by me. He will surely exterminate in battle all my wicked<br>sons. Everything, therefore, seems to me to be fraught with danger, and<br>my mind is full of anxiety, O thou of great intelligence, tell me such<br>words as may dispel my anxiety.'<br><br>"Vidura said, 'O sinless one, in nothing else than knowledge and<br>asceticism, in nothing else than restraining the senses, in nothing else<br>than complete abandonment of avarice, do I see thy good. Fear is<br>dispelled by self-knowledge; by asceticism one winneth what is great and<br>valuable; by waiting upon superiors learning is acquired; and peace is<br>gained by self-restraint. They that desire salvation without having<br>acquired the merit attainable by gifts, or that which is attainable by<br>practising the ritual of the Vedas, do not sojourn through life, freed<br>from anger and aversion. The happiness that may be derived from a<br>judicious course of study, from a battle fought virtuously, from ascetic<br>austerities performed rigidly, always increaseth at the end. They that<br>are no longer in peace with their relatives, obtain no steep even if they<br>have recourse to well-made beds; nor do they, O king, derive any plea.<br>sure from women, or the laudatory hymns of bards and eulogists. Such<br>persons can never practise virtue. Happiness can never be theirs, in this<br>world. Honours can never be theirs, and peace hath no charm for them.<br>Counsels that are for their benefit please them not. They never acquire<br>what they have not, nor succeed in retaining what they have, O king,<br>there is no other end for such men save destruction. As milk is possible<br>in kine, asceticism in Brahmanas, and inconstancy in women, so fear is<br>possible from relatives. Numerous thin threads of equal length, collected<br>together, are competent to bear, from the strength of numbers, the<br>constant rolling of the shuttle-cock over them. The case is even so with<br>relatives that are good, O bull of the Bharata race, separated from one<br>another, burning brands produce only smoke; but brought together they<br>blaze forth into a powerful flame. The case is even so, O Dhritarashtra,<br>with relatives. They, O Dhritarashtra, who tyrannise over Brahmanas,<br>women, relatives, and kine, soon fall off their stalks, like fruits that<br>are ripe. And the tree that stands singly, though gigantic and strong and<br>deep-rooted, hath its trunk soon smashed and twisted by a mighty wind.<br>Those trees, however, that grow in close compact are competent owing to<br>mutual dependence to resist winds more violent still. Thus he that is<br>single, however, endowed with all the virtues, is regarded by foes as<br>capable of being vanquished like an isolated tree by the wind. Relatives,<br>again, in consequence of mutual dependence and mutual aid, grow together,<br>like lotus-stalks in a lake. These must never be slain, viz., Brahmanas,<br>kine, relatives, children, women, those whose food is eaten, and those<br>also that yield by asking for protection. O king, without wealth no good<br>quality can show itself in a person. If, however, thou art in health,<br>thou canst achieve thy good, for he is dead who is unhealthy and ill. O<br>king, anger is a kind of bitter, pungent, acrid, and hot drink, painful<br>in its consequences: it is a kind of headache not born of any physical<br>illness, and they that are unwise can never digest it. Do thou, O king,<br>swallow it up and obtain peace. They that are tortured by disease have no<br>liking for enjoyments, nor do they desire any happiness from wealth. The<br>sick, however, filled with sorrow, know not what happiness is or what the<br>enjoyments of wealth are. Beholding Draupadi won at dice, I told thee<br>before, O king, these words,&#8212;They that are honest avoid deceit in play.<br>Therefore, stop Duryodhana! Thou didst not, however, act according to my<br>words. That is not strength which is opposed to softness. On the other<br>hand, strength mixed with softness constitutes true policy which should<br>ever be pursued. That prosperity which is dependent on crookedness alone<br>is destined to be destroyed. That prosperity, however, which depends on<br>both strength and softness, descends to sons and grandsons in tact. Let,<br>therefore, thy sons cherish the Pandavas, and the Pandavas also cherish<br>thy sons. O king, let the Kurus and the Pandavas, both having same<br>friends and same foes, live together in happiness and prosperity. Thou<br>art, today, O king, the refuge of the sons of Kuru. Indeed, the race of<br>Kuru, O Ajamida, is dependent on thee. O sire, preserving thy fame<br>unsullied, cherish thou the children of Pandu, afflicted as they are with<br>the sufferings of exile. O descendant of Kuru, make peace with the sons<br>of Pandu. Let not thy foes discover thy holes. They all, O god among men,<br>are devoted to truth. O king of men, withdraw Duryodhana from his evil<br>ways.'"
