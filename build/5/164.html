                            "Sanjaya said, 'Having heard those words of Duryodhana, Gudakesha of<br>great fame looked at the gambler's son with eyes exceedingly red. And<br>eyeing Kesava also and tossing his massive arms, he addressed the<br>gambler's son, saying, 'He, who, relying on his own strength, summoneth<br>his foes and fighteth with them fearlessly, is spoken of as a man. He,<br>however, who, relying on the strength of others, summoneth his foes, is<br>an infamous Kshatriya. In consequence of his incapacity, such a one is<br>regarded as the lowest of men. Relying on the strength of others, thou (O<br>Duryodhana), being a coward thyself, desirest yet, O fool, to rebuke thy<br>foes. Having installed (Bhishma) the oldest of all the Kshatriyas, whose<br>heart is ever bent in doing what is good, who hath all his passions under<br>control, and who is endued with great wisdom, in the command of thy<br>troops and made him liable to certain death, thou indulgest in brag! O<br>thou of wicked understanding, thy object (in doing this) is fully known<br>to us, O wretch of thy race! Thou hast done it, believing that sons of<br>Pandu will not, from kindness, slay the son of Ganga. Know, however, O<br>Dhritarashtra's son, that I will slay that Bhishma first in the sight of<br>all the bowmen, relying upon whose strength thou indulgest in such<br>boasts! O gambler's son, repairing (hence) unto the Bharatas and<br>approaching Duryodhana the son of Dhritarashtra, say unto him that Arjuna<br>hath said,&#8212;So be it! After this night will have passed away, the fierce<br>encounter of arms will take place. Indeed, Bhishma of unfailing might and<br>firmly adhering to truth, hath told thee in the midst of the Kurus these<br>words, viz.,&#8212;I will slay the army of the Srinjayas and the Salweyas. Let<br>that be my task. Excepting Drona I can slay the whole world. Thou needest<br>not, therefore, entertain any fear oil the Pandavas! At this, thou, O<br>Duryodhana, regardest the kingdom as thy own and thinkest that the<br>Pandavas have sunk into distress. Thou hast been filled with pride at<br>this. Thou seest not, however, danger that is in thy own self. I shall,<br>therefore, in battle, first slay before thy very eyes, Bhishma the eldest<br>of the Kurus! At sunrise (tomorrow) at the head of the troops, with<br>standards and cars protect ye that leader of thy forces firm in his<br>promises. I shall, with my arrows, throw him down who is your refuge from<br>his car before the eyes of you all! When the morrow cometh, Suyodhana<br>will know what it is to indulge in brag, beholding the grandsire covered<br>with my arrows! Thou shalt, O Suyodhana, very soon see the fulfilment of<br>that which Bhimasena in anger had said, in the midst of the assembly,<br>unto thy brother, that man of limited sight, viz., Dussasana, wedded to<br>unrighteousness, always quarrelsome, of wicked understanding, and cruel<br>in behaviour. Thou shalt soon see the terrible effects of vanity and<br>pride, of wrath and arrogance, of bragging and heartlessness, cutting<br>words and acts, of aversion from righteousness, and sinfulness and<br>speaking ill of others, of transgressing the counsels of the aged, of<br>oblique sight, and of all kinds of vices! O scum of humanity, how canst<br>thou, O fool, hope for either life or kingdom, if I, having Vasudeva for<br>my second, give way to anger? After Bhishma and Drona will have been<br>quieted and after the Suta's son will have been overthrown, thou shalt be<br>hopeless of life, kingdom and sons! Hearing of the slaughter of thy<br>brothers and sons, and struck mortally by Bhimasena, thou wilt, O<br>Suyodhana, recollect all thy misdeeds!&#8212;Tell him, O gambler's son, that I<br>do not vow a second time. I tell thee truly that all this will be<br>true!&#8212;Departing hence, O Uluka, say, O sire, these words of mine, unto<br>Suyodhana! It behoveth thee not to apprehend my behaviour by the light of<br>thy own! Know the difference there is between thy conduct and mine, which<br>is even the difference between truth and falsehood! I do not wish harm to<br>even insects and ants. What shall I say, therefore, of my ever wishing<br>harm to my kinsmen? O sire, it was for this that five villages only were<br>solicited by me! Why, O thou of wicked understanding, dost thou not see<br>the dire calamity that threatens thee? Thy soul overwhelmed with lust,<br>thou indulgest in vauntings from defectiveness of understanding. It is<br>for this also thou acceptest not the beneficial words of Vasudeva. What<br>need now of much talk? Fight (against us) with all thy friends! Say, O<br>gambler's son, unto the Kuru prince who always doth what is injurious to<br>me (these words also, viz.,)&#8212;Thy words have been heard; their sense also<br>hath been understood. Let it be as thou wishest!'<br><br>'O son of king, Bhimasena then once more said these words, 'O Uluka, say<br>those words of mine unto the wicked-minded, deceitful, and unrighteous<br>Suyodhana, who is an embodiment of sin, who is wedded to guile, and whose<br>behaviour is exceedingly wicked. Thou shalt have to dwell in the stomach<br>of a vulture or in Hastinapura. O scum of human kind, I shall assuredly<br>fulfil the vow I have made in the midst of the assembly. I swear in the<br>name of Truth, slaying Dussasana in battle, I shall quaff his life-blood!<br>Slaying also thy (other) brothers, I shall smash thy own thighs. Without<br>doubt, O Suyodhana, I am the destroyer of all the sons of Dhritarashtra,<br>as Abhimanyu is of all the (younger) princes! I shall by my deeds,<br>gratify you all! Hearken once more to me. O Suyodhana, slaying thee, with<br>all thy uterine brothers, I shall strike the crown of thy head with my<br>foot in the sight of the king Yudhishthira the Just!'<br><br>'Nakula, then, O king, said these words, 'O Uluka, say unto<br>Dhritarashtra's son, Suyodhana, of Kuru's race that all the words uttered<br>by him have now been heard and their sense understood. I shall, O<br>Kauravya, do all that thou hast commended me to do.'<br><br>'And Sahadeva also, O monarch, said these words of grave import, 'O<br>Suyodhana, it will all be as thou wishest! Thou shalt have to repent, O<br>great king, along with thy children, kinsmen, and counsellors, even as<br>thou art now bragging joyously in view of our sufferings.'<br><br>'Then Virata and Drupada, both venerable in years, said these words unto<br>Uluka, It is even our wish that we become slaves of a virtuous person!<br>Whether, however, we are slaves or masters, will be known tomorrow, as<br>also who owns what manliness!'<br><br>'After them, Sikhandin said these words unto Uluka, 'Thou must say unto<br>king Duryodhana who is always addicted to sinfulness, these words,<br>viz.,&#8212;See, O king, what fierce deed is perpetrated by me in battle! I<br>shall slay grandsire of thine from his car, relying upon whose prowess<br>thou art certain of success in battle! Without doubt, I have been created<br>by the high-souled Creator for the destruction of Bhishma. I shall<br>assuredly slay Bhishma in the sight of all bowmen.'<br><br>'After this, Dhrishtadyumna also said unto Uluka, the gambler's son,<br>these words, 'Say unto prince Suyodhana these my words, viz., I shall<br>slay Drona with all his followers and friends. And I shall do a deed<br>which none else will ever do.'<br><br>'King Yudhishthira once more said these high words fraught with clemency,<br>viz.,&#8212;O monarch, I never desire the slaughter of my kinsmen. O thou of<br>wicked understanding, it is from thy fault that all this will assuredly<br>take place. I shall, of course, have to sanction the fulfilment of their<br>great feats by all these (around me). Go hence, O Uluka, without delay or<br>stay here, O sire, for, blessed be thou, we too are thy kinsmen.'<br><br>'Uluka, then, O king, thinking permission of Yudhishthira, the son of<br>Dharma, went thither where king Suyodhana was. Thus addressed, the<br>gambler's son carefully bearing in mind all he had heard, returned to the<br>place from which he had come. And arriving there, he fully represented<br>unto the vindictive Duryodhana all that Arjuna had charged him with. And<br>he also faithfully communicated unto Dhritarashtra's son the words of<br>Vasudeva, of Bhima, of king Yudhishthira the Just, of Nakula and Virata<br>and Drupada, O Bharata and the words of Sahadeva and Dhrishtadyumna and<br>Sikhandin, and the words also that were spoken (subsequently) by Kesava<br>and Arjuna. And having listened to the words of the gambler's son,<br>Duryodhana, that bull of Bharata's race, ordered Dussasana and Karna and<br>Sakuni, O Bharata, and their own troops and the troops of the allies, and<br>all the (assembled) kings, to be arrayed in divisions and be ready for<br>battle before sunrise (next morrow). Messengers then, instructed by Karna<br>and hastily mounting on cars and camels and mares and good steeds endued<br>with great fleetness, quickly rode through the encampment. And at Karna's<br>command they promulgated the order&#8212;Array (yourselves) before sunrise<br>tomorrow!'"
