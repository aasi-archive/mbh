                            "Baladeva said, 'You have all listened to the speech of him who is the<br>elder brother of Gada, characterised as it is by a sense of virtue and<br>prudence, and salutary alike to Yudhishthira and king Duryodhana. These<br>valiant sons of Kunti are ready to give up half their kingdom, and they<br>make this sacrifice for the sake of Duryodhana. The sons of<br>Dhritarashtra, therefore, should give up half of the kingdom, and should<br>rejoice and be exceedingly happy with us that the quarrel can be so<br>satisfactorily settled. These mighty persons having obtained the kingdom<br>would, no doubt, be pacified and happy, provided the opposite party<br>behave well. For them to be pacified will redound to the welfare of men.<br>And I should be well-pleased if somebody from here, with the view of<br>pacifying both the Kurus and the Pandavas, should undertake a journey and<br>ascertain what is the mind of Duryodhana and explain the views of<br>Yudhishthira. Let him respectfully salute Bhishma the heroic scion of<br>Kuru's race, and the magnanimous son of Vichitravirya, and Drona along<br>with his son, and Vidura and Kripa, and the king of Gandhara, along with<br>the Suta's son. Let him also pay his respects to all the other sons of<br>Dhritarashtra, to all who are renowned for strength and learning, devoted<br>to their proper duties, heroic, and conversant with signs of the times.<br>When all these persons are gathered together and when also the elderly<br>citizens are assembled, let him speak words full of humility and likely<br>to serve the interests of Yudhishthira, At all events, let them not be<br>provoked, for they have taken possession of the kingdom with a strong<br>hand. When Yudhishthira had his throne, he forgot himself by being<br>engaged in gambling and was dispossessed by them of his kingdom. This<br>valiant Kuru, this descendant of Ajamida, Yudhishthira, though not<br>skilled in dice and though dissuaded by all his friends, challenged the<br>son of the king of Gandhara, an adept at dice, to the match. There were<br>then at that place thousands of dice-players whom Yudhishthira could<br>defeat in a match. Taking however, no notice of any of them, he<br>challenged Suvala's son of all men to the game, and so he lost. And<br>although the dice constantly went against him, he would still have Sakuni<br>alone for his opponent. Competing with Sakuni in the play, he sustained a<br>crushing defeat. For this, no blame can attach to Sakuni. Let the<br>messenger make use of words characterised by humility, words intended to<br>conciliate Vichitravirya's son. The messenger may thus bring round<br>Dhritarashtra's son to his own views. Do not seek war with the Kurus;<br>address Duryodhana in only a conciliatory tone, The object may possibly<br>fail to be gained by war, but it may be gained by conciliation, and by<br>this means also it may be gained enduringly.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'While that valiant scion of Madhu's race was<br>even continuing his speech, the gallant son of the race of Sini suddenly<br>rose up and indignantly condemned the words of the former by these words<br>of his.'
