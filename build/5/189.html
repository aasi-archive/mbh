                            "Rama said, 'O damsel, in the very sight of all these persons, I have<br>fought according to the best of my power and displayed my prowess! By<br>using even the very best of weapons I have not been able to obtain any<br>advantage over Bhishma, that foremost of all wielders of weapons! I have<br>exerted now to the best of my power and might. O beautiful lady, go<br>withersoever thou wishest! What other business of thine can I accomplish?<br>Seek the protection of Bhishma himself! Thou hast no other refuge now!<br>Shooting mighty weapons Bhishma hath vanquished me!' Having said this,<br>the high-souled Rama sighed and remained silent. That maiden then<br>addressed him, saying, 'O holy one, it is even so as thy holy self hath<br>said! This Bhishma of great intelligence is incapable of being vanquished<br>in battle by even the gods! Thou hast done my business to the best of thy<br>exertion and power. Thou hast displayed in this battle energy incapable<br>of being baffled and weapons also of diverse kinds. Thou hast yet been<br>unable to obtain any advantage over Bhishma in combat. As regards myself,<br>I will not go a second time to Bhishma. I will, however, O perpetuator of<br>Bhrigu's race, go thither, O thou endued with wealth of asceticism, where<br>I may (obtain the means to) myself slay Bhishma in battle!' Having said<br>the words, that maiden went away, with eyes agitated with wrath, and<br>thinking to compass my death, she firmly resolved to devote herself to<br>asceticism. Then that foremost one of Bhrigu's race, accompanied by those<br>ascetics, bidding me farewell, departed, O Bharata, for the mountains<br>whence he had come. I also, ascending my car, and praised by the<br>Brahmanas, entered our city and represented, everything unto my mother<br>Satyavati, everything that had transpired, and she, O great king, uttered<br>benedictions on me. I then appointed persons endued with intelligence to<br>ascertain the doings of that maiden. Devoted to the good of myself&#8212;their<br>well-wisher, those spies of mine, with great application brought to me<br>accounts of her course of action, her words and actions, from day to day.<br>When that maiden went to the woods, resolved on ascetic austerities, even<br>then I became melancholy, and afflicted with pain, I lost my heart's<br>tenor. Except one acquainted with Brahma and observant of vows, that are<br>praiseworthy owing to the austerities they involve, no Kshatriya hath<br>ever by his prowess, vanquished me in battle! I then, O king, humbly<br>represented to Narada as also to Vyasa all that the maiden did. They both<br>told me, 'O Bhishma, do not give way to sorrow on account of the daughter<br>of Kasi. Who is there that would venture to baffle destiny by individual<br>exertion?' Meanwhile, O great king, that maiden, entering a cluster of<br>retreats practised austerities, that were beyond human powers (of<br>endurance). Without food, emaciated, dry, with matted-locks and begrimed<br>with filth, for six months she lived on air only, and stood unmoved like<br>a street-post. And that lady, possessed of wealth of asceticism,<br>foregoing all food in consequence of the fast she kept, passed a whole<br>year after this, standing in the waters of the Yamuna. Endued with great<br>wrath, she passed the next whole year standing on her front toes and<br>having eaten only one fallen leaf (of a tree). And thus for twelve years,<br>she made the heavens hot by her austerities. And though dissuaded by her<br>relatives, she could not by any means be weaned off (from that course of<br>action). She then went unto Vatsabhumi resorted to by the Siddhas and<br>Charanas, and which was the retreat of high-souled ascetics of pious<br>deeds. Bathing frequently in the sacred waters of that retreat, the<br>princess of Kasi roamed about according to her will. Proceeding next (one<br>after another) to the asylum, O king, of Narada, and to the auspicious<br>asylum of Uluka and to that of Chyavana, and to the spot sacred to<br>Brahmana, and to Prayaga the sacrificial platform of the gods, and to<br>that forest sacred to the gods, and to Bhogawati, and, O monarch, to the<br>asylum of Kusika's son (Viswamitra), and to the asylum of Mandavya, and<br>also to the asylum of Dwilipa, and to Ramhrada, and, O Kaurava, to the<br>asylum of Garga, the princess of Kasi, O king, performed ablutions in the<br>sacred waters of all these, observing all the while the most difficult of<br>vows. One day, my mother from the waters asked her, O Kauravya, saying,<br>'O blessed lady, for what dost thou afflict thyself so? Tell me the<br>truth!' Thus asked, O monarch, that faultless damsel answered her with<br>joined hands, saying, 'O thou of handsome eyes, Rama hath been vanquished<br>in battle by Bhishma. What other (Kshatriya) king then would venture to<br>defeat the latter when ready with his weapons? As regards myself, I am<br>practising the severest penances for the destruction of Bhishma. I wander<br>over the earth, O goddess, so that I may slay that king! In every thing I<br>do, O goddess, even this is the great end of my vows!' Hearing these<br>words of hers, the Ocean-going (river Ganga) replied unto her, saying, 'O<br>lady, thou art acting crookedly! O weak girl, this wish of thine thou<br>shalt not be able to achieve, O faultless one? if, O princess of Kasi,<br>thou observest these vows for destruction of Bhishma, and if thou takest<br>leave of thy body while observing them, thou shalt (in thy next birth)<br>become a river, crooked in her course and of water only during the rains!<br>All the bathing places along thy course will be difficult of approach,<br>and filled only during the rains, thou shalt be dry for eight months<br>(during the year)! Full of terrible alligators, and creatures of<br>frightful mien thou shalt inspire fear in all creatures! Addressing her<br>thus, O king, my mother, that highly-blessed lady, in seeming smiles,<br>dismissed the princess of Kasi. That highly fair damsel then once more<br>began to practise vows, foregoing all food, aye, even water, sometimes<br>for eight months and sometimes for ten months! And the daughter of the<br>king of Kasi, wandering hither and thither for her passionate desire of<br>tirthas, once more came back, O Kauravya, to Vatsabhumi. And it is there,<br>O Bharata, that she is known to have become a river, filled only during<br>the rainy seasons, abounding with crocodiles, crooked in her course, and<br>destitute of easy access to her water. And, O king, in consequence of her<br>ascetic merit only half her body became such a river in Vatsabhumi, while<br>with the other half, she remained a maiden as before!'
