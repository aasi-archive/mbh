                            "Duryodhana said, 'Fear not, O king. Nor shouldest thou grieve for us. O<br>monarch, O lord, we are quite able to vanquish the foe in battle. When<br>the Parthas had been exiled to the woods, there came unto them the slayer<br>of Madhu with a vast army in battle array and capable of crushing hostile<br>kingdoms; and there also came unto them the Kekayas, and Dhrishtaketu,<br>and Dhrishtadyumna of Pritha's race and numerous other kings in their<br>train; and all those great car-warriors were assembled in a place not far<br>from Indraprastha; and having assembled together they censured thee and<br>all the Kurus. And O Bharata, all those warriors with Krishna at their<br>head paid their homage unto Yudhishthira clad in deerskin and seated in<br>their midst. And all those kings then suggested to Yudhishthira that he<br>should take back the kingdom. And all of them desired to slay thee with<br>all the followers. And hearing of all this, O bull of the Bharata race, I<br>addressed Bhishma and Drona and Kripa, struck with fear, O king, at the<br>prospect of the ruin that threatened our kindred. And I said unto them,<br>'I think the Pandavas will not abide by the agreement made by them;<br>Vasudeva desireth our utter extinction. I think also that with the<br>exception of Vidura all of you will be slain, although the chief of the<br>Kurus, Dhritarashtra, conversant with morality, will not be included in<br>the slaughter, O sire, effecting our complete destruction, Janardana<br>wisheth to bestow upon Yudhishthira the entire kingdom of the Kurus. What<br>should be done? Shall we surrender, or fly, or shall we fight the foe<br>giving up every hope of life? If, indeed, we stand up against them, our<br>defeat is certain, for all the kings of the earth are under<br>Yudhishthira's command. The people of the realm are all annoyed with us,<br>and all our friends also are angry with us. All the kings of the earth<br>are speaking ill of us, and especially all our friends and relatives.<br>There can be no fault in our surrender, for from time immemorial, the<br>weaker party is known to conclude peace. I grieve, however, for that lord<br>of men, my, blind father, who may, on my account, be overtaken by woe and<br>misery that is endless. [It is known to thee, O king, even before this,<br>that thy other sons were all opposed to the foe for pleasing me only].<br>Those mighty car-warriors, the sons of Pandu, will, indeed, avenge their<br>wrongs by destroying the whole race of king Dhritarashtra with all his<br>counsellors.&#8212;(It was thus that I addressed them, and) seeing me<br>afflicted by great anxiety and my senses tortured, Drona and Bhishma and<br>Kripa and Drona's son then addressed me, saying, 'Fear not, O represser<br>of foes, for if the foe wage hostilities with us, they will not be able<br>to vanquish us when we take the field. Every one of us is singly capable<br>of vanquishing all the kings of the earth. Let them come. With keen-edged<br>arrows we will curb their pride. Inflamed with anger upon the death of<br>his father, this Bhishma (amongst us) in days of old had conquered all<br>the kings of the earth, on a single car. O Bharata, his wrath excited,<br>that best of the Kurus smote numberless ones amongst them, whereupon from<br>fear, they are surrendered to this Devavrata seeking his protection. That<br>Bhishma, united with us, is still capable of vanquishing the foe in<br>battle. Let thy fears, therefore, O bull of the Bharata race, be all<br>dispelled.'<br><br>"Duryodhana continued, 'Even this was the resolve then formed by these<br>heroes of immeasurable energy. The whole earth was formerly under the<br>foe's command. Now, however, they are incapable of vanquishing us in<br>battle, for our enemies, the sons of Pandu, are now without allies and<br>destitute of energy. O bull of the Bharata race, the sovereignty of the<br>earth now resteth in me, and the kings also, assembled by me, are of the<br>same mind with me in weal or woe. Know thou, O best of the Kuru race,<br>that all these kings, O slayer of foes, can, for my sake, enter into the<br>fire or the sea. They are all laughing at thee, beholding thee filled<br>with grief and including in these lamentations like one out of his wits,<br>and affrighted at the praises of the foe. Every one amongst these kings<br>is able to withstand the Pandavas. Indeed, sire, every one regardeth<br>himself; let thy fears, therefore, be dispelled. Even Vasava himself is<br>not capable of vanquishing my vast host. The Self-create Brahma himself,<br>if desirous of slaying it, cannot annihilate it. Having given up all<br>hopes of a city, Yudhishthira craveth only five villages, affrighted, O<br>lord, at the army I have assembled and at my power. The belief thou<br>entertainest in the prowess of Vrikodara, the son of Kunti, is unfounded.<br>O Bharata, thou knowest not the extent of my prowess. There is none on<br>earth equal to me in an encounter with the mace. None have ever surpassed<br>me in such an encounter, nor will any surpass me. With devoted<br>application and undergoing many privations, I have lived in my<br>preceptor's abode. I have completed my knowledge and exercises there. It<br>is for this that I have no fear either of Bhima or of others. When I<br>humbly waited upon Sankarshana (my preceptor), blessed be thou, it was<br>his firm conviction that Duryodhana hath no equal in the mace. In battle<br>I am Sankarshana's equal, and in might there is none superior to me on<br>earth. Bhima will never be able to bear the blow of my mace in battle. A<br>single blow, O king, that I may wrathfully deal unto Bhima will<br>certainly, O hero, carry him without delay to the abode of Yama. O king,<br>I wish to see Vrikodara mace in hand. This hath been my long-cherished<br>desire. Struck in battle with my mace, Vrikodara, the son of Pritha, will<br>fall dead on the ground, his limbs shattered. Smitten with a blow of my<br>mace, the mountains of Himavat may split into a hundred thousands<br>fragments. Vrikodra himself knoweth this truth, as also Vasudeva and<br>Arjuna, that there is no one equal to Duryodhana in the use of mace. Let<br>thy fears, therefore, caused by Vrikodara. be dispelled, for I will<br>certainly slay him in fierce conflict. Do not, O king, give way to<br>melancholy. And after I have slain him, numerous car-warriors of equal or<br>superior energy, will, O bull among the Bharatas, speedily throw Arjuna<br>down. Bhishma, Drona Kripa and Drona's son, Karna and, Bhurisravas,<br>Salya, the king of Pragjyotish, and Jayadratha, the king of the<br>Sindhus,&#8212;every one of these, O Bharata, is singly capable of slaying the<br>Pandavas. When united together, they will, within a moment, send Arjuna<br>to the abode of Yama. There, indeed, is no reason why the united army of<br>all the kings will be incapable of vanquishing Dhananjaya singly. A<br>hundred times shrouded by immeasurable arrows shot by Bhishma and Drona<br>and Drona's son and Kripa, and deprived of strength, Partha will have to<br>go unto Yama's abode. Our grandsire born of Ganga is, O Bharata, superior<br>to Santanu himself. Like unto a regenerate saint, and incapable of being<br>withstood by the very celestials, he took his birth amongst men. There is<br>no slayer of Bhishma, O king, on earth, for his father, being gratified,<br>gave him the boon,&#8212;Thou shalt not die except when it is thy own wish.<br>And Drona took his birth in a water-pot from the regenerate saint<br>Bharadwaja. And from Drona hath taken birth his son, having a knowledge<br>of the highest weapons. And this the foremost of preceptors. Kripa also,<br>hath taken his birth from the great Rishi Gautama. Born in a clump of<br>heath this illustrious one, I think, is incapable of being slain. Then<br>again, O king, the father, mother and maternal uncle of<br>Aswatthaman,&#8212;these three,&#8212;are not born of woman's womb. I have that<br>hero also on my side. All these mighty car-warriors, O king, are like<br>unto celestials, and can, O bull of the Bharata race, inflict pain on<br>Sakra himself in battle. Arjuna is incapable of even looking at any one<br>of these singly. When united together, these tigers among men will<br>certainly slay Dhananjaya. Karna also, I suppose, is equal unto Bhishma<br>and Drona and Kripa. O Bharata, Rama himself had told him,&#8212;Thou art<br>equal unto me. Karna had two ear-rings born with him, of great brilliance<br>and beauty; for Sachi's gratification Indra begged them of that repressor<br>of foes, in exchange, O king, of an infallible and terrible shaft. How<br>would Dhananjaya, therefore, escape with life from Karna who is protected<br>by that arrow? My success, therefore, O king, is as certain as a fruit<br>held fast in my own grasp. The utter defeat also of my foes is already<br>bruited about on earth. This Bhishma, O Bharata, killeth every day ten<br>thousand soldiers. Equal unto him are these bowmen, Drona, Drona's son<br>and Kripa. Then, O repressor of foes, the ranks of the Samsaptaka<br>warriors have made this resolution,&#8212;Either we will slay Arjuna or that<br>Ape-bannered warrior will slay us. There are other kings also, who firm<br>in their resolve of slaying Savyasachin, regard him as unequal to<br>themselves. Why dost thou then apprehend danger from the Pandavas? When<br>Bhimasena will be slain, O Bharata, who else (amongst them) will fight?<br>Tell me this, O repressor of foes, if thou knowest any amongst the foes.<br>The five brothers, with Dhrishtadyumna and Satyaki,&#8212;these seven warriors<br>of the enemy, O king, are regarded as their chief strength. Those,<br>however, amongst us, that are our chief warriors, are Bhishma, Drona,<br>Kripa, Drona's son, Karna, Somadatta, Vahlika, and Salya, the king of<br>Pragjyotisha, the two kings (Vindha and Anuvinda) of Avanti, and<br>Jayadratha; and then, O king, thy sons Dussasana, Durmukha, Dussaha,<br>Srutayu; Chitrasena, Purumitra, Vivingsati, Sala, Bhurisravas, and<br>Vikarna. O king, I have assembled one and ten Akshauhinis. The army of<br>the enemy is less than mine, amounting only to seven Akshauhinis. How<br>then can I be defeated? Vrihaspati hath said that an army which is less<br>by a third ought to be encountered. My army, O king, exceedeth that of<br>the foe by a third. Besides, O Bharata, I know that the enemy hath many<br>defects, while mine, O lord, are endued with many good virtues. Knowing<br>all this, O Bharata, as also the superiority of my force and the<br>inferiority of the Pandavas, it behoveth thee not to lose thy senses.<br><br>'Having said this, O Bharata, that conqueror of hostile chiefs,<br>Duryodhana, asked Sanjaya again, anxious to known more about the doings<br>of the Pandavas.'"
