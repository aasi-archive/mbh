                            "Vaisampayana said, 'When Duryodhana, the son of Dhritarashtra, showed<br>little regard for the words spoken by Sanjaya, and when the rest remained<br>silent, the assembled kings rose up and retired. And after all the kings<br>of the earth had retired, king Dhritarashtra, who always followed the<br>counsels of his son from affection, wishing success to the assembled<br>kings, began to enquire in secret of Sanjaya about the resolve of his own<br>party, and of the Pandavas who were hostile to him. And Dhritarashtra<br>said, 'Tell me truly, O son of Gavalgana, in what consists the strength<br>and weakness of our own host, Minutely acquainted as thou art with the<br>affairs of the Pandavas, tell me in what lies their superiority and in<br>what, their inferiority. Thou are fully conversant with the strength of<br>both parties, Thou knowest all things, and art well-versed in all matters<br>of virtue and profit. Asked by me, O Sanjaya, say which of the parties,<br>when engaged in battle, will perish?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'I will not say anything to thee in secret, O king, for<br>then thou mayst entertain ill-feelings towards me. Bring thou hither, O<br>Ajamida, thy father Vyasa of high vows and thy queen Gandhari. Conversant<br>with morality, of keen perception, and capable of arriving at the truth,<br>they will remove any ill-feelings thou mayst cherish against me. In their<br>presence, O king, I will tell thee everything about the intensions of<br>Kesava and Partha.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed, Dhritarashtra caused both<br>Gandhari and Vyasa to be brought there. And introduced by Vidura they<br>entered the court without delay. And understanding the intentions of both<br>Sanjaya and his son, Krishna-Dwaipayana endued with great wisdom said,<br>'Say, O Sanjaya, unto the enquiring Dhritarashtra everything that he<br>desireth to know. Tell him truly all that thou knowest about Vasudeva and<br>Arjuna.'"
