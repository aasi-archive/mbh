                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing, O bull of Bharata's race, these words of<br>Kesava, Bhishma, the son of Santanu, then said unto vindictive<br>Duryodhana, Krishna hath spoken to thee, desirous of bringing about peace<br>between kinsmen. O sire, follow those counsels, and do not yield to the<br>influence of wrath. If thou dost not act, O sire, according to the words<br>of the high-souled Kesava, neither prosperity, nor happiness nor what is<br>for thy good, wilt thou ever have. The mighty-armed Kesava, O sire, hath<br>said unto thee what is consistent with virtue and profit. Accept thou<br>that object, and do not, O king, exterminate the population of the earth.<br>This resplendent prosperity of the Bharatas amongst all the kings of the<br>earth, thou wilt, during the very life of Dhritarashtra, destroy through<br>thy wickedness, and thou wilt also, through this arrogant disposition of<br>thine, deprive thyself with all thy counsellors, sons, brothers, and<br>kinsmen, of life, if, O thou foremost of Bharata's race, thou<br>transgressest the words of Kesava, thy father, and of wise Vidura,&#8212;words<br>that are consistent with truth and fraught with benefit to thyself. Be<br>not the exterminator of thy race, be not a wicked man, let not thy heart<br>be sinful, do not tread the path of unrighteousness. Do not sink thy<br>father and mother into an ocean of grief.' After Bhishma had concluded,<br>Drona also said these words unto Duryodhana, who, filled with wrath, was<br>then breathing heavily, 'O sire, the words that Kesava hath spoken unto<br>thee are fraught with virtue and profit, Santanu's son Bhishma also hath<br>said the same. Accept those words, O monarch. Both of them are wise,<br>endued with great intelligence, with souls under control, desirous of<br>doing what is for thy good, and possessed of great learning. They have<br>said what is beneficial. Accept their words, O king, O thou possessed of<br>great wisdom, act according to what both Krishna and Bhishma have said. O<br>chastiser of foes, do not, from delusion of understanding, disregard<br>Madhava. They that are always encouraging thee, are unable to give thee<br>victory. During the time of battle they will throw the burthen of<br>hostility on other's necks. Do not slaughter the Earth's population. Do<br>not slay thy sons and brothers. Know that host is invincible in the midst<br>of which are Vasudeva and Arjuna. If, O Bharata, thou dost not accept the<br>truthful words of thy friends, Krishna and Bhishma, then, O sire, thou<br>wilt surely have to repent. Arjuna is even greater than what Jamadagni's<br>son hath described him to be. As regards Krishna, the son of Devaki, he<br>is incapable of being resisted by even the gods. O bull of Bharata's<br>race, what use is there in telling thee what is really conducive to thy<br>happiness and good? Everything hath now been said unto thee. Do what thou<br>wishest. I do not wish to say anything more unto thee, O foremost of<br>Bharata's race.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'After Drona had ceased, Vidura also, otherwise<br>called Kshattri, casting his eyes on Duryodhana, said unto that<br>vindictive son of Dhritarashtra, 'O Duryodhana, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>I do not grieve for thee. I grieve, however, for this old couple, viz.,<br>Gandhari and thy father. Having thee, of wicked soul for their protector<br>(of whom they will shortly be deprived), they will have to wander with<br>anybody to look after them, and deprived also of friends and counsellors,<br>like a pair of birds shorn of their wings. Having begotten such a wicked<br>son who is the exterminator of his race, alas, these two will have to<br>wander over the earth in sorrow, subsisting on alms.' After this, king<br>Dhritarashtra, addressing Duryodhana, seated in the midst of his brothers<br>and surrounded by all the kings, said, 'Listen, O Duryodhana, to what the<br>high-souled Sauri hath said. Accept those words which are eternal, highly<br>beneficial and conducive to what is for thy highest good. With the aid of<br>this Krishna of faultless deeds, we amongst all the kings, are sure to<br>have all our cherished objects. Firmly united by Kesava, be reconciled, O<br>sire, with Yudhishthira. Seek thou this great good of the Bharatas like<br>unto an august ceremony of propitiation. Through Vasudeva's agency, bind<br>thyself closely with the Pandavas. I think, the time for that is come. Do<br>not let the opportunity pass away. If, however, thou disregardest Kesava,<br>who from a desire of achieving what is for good, is soliciting thee to<br>make peace, then victory will never be thine.'"
