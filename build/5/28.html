                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Without doubt, O Sanjaya, it is true that righteous<br>deeds are the foremost of all our acts, as thou sayest. Thou shouldst,<br>however, ensure me having first ascertained whether it is virtue or vice<br>that I practise. When vice assumes the aspects of virtue and virtue<br>itself wholly seems as vice, and virtue, again, appears in its native<br>form, they that are learned should discriminate it by means of their<br>reason. So, again, virtue and vice, which are both eternal and absolute,<br>exchange their aspects during seasons of distress. One should follow<br>without deviation the duties prescribed for the order to which he belongs<br>by birth. Know, O Sanjaya, that duties in seasons of distress are<br>otherwise. When his means of living are totally gone, the man, that is<br>destitute should certainly desire those other means by which he may be<br>able to discharge the sanctioned duties of his order. One that is not<br>destitute of his means of living, as also one that is in distress, are, O<br>Sanjaya, both to be blamed, if they act as if the state of each were<br>otherwise. When the Creator hath ordained expiation for those Brahmanas,<br>who, without wishing for self-destruction, betake themselves to acts not<br>sanctioned for them, this proves that people may, in season of distress,<br>betake to acts not ordained for the orders to which they belong. And, O<br>Sanjaya, thou shouldst regard them as worthy that adhere to the practices<br>of their own order in usual times as also those that do not adhere to<br>them in season of distress; thou shouldst censure them that act otherwise<br>in usual times while adhering to their ordained practices during times of<br>distress. As regards men desiring to bring their minds under control,<br>when they endeavour to acquire a knowledge of self, the practices that<br>are ordained for the best, viz., the Brahmanas, are equally ordained for<br>them. As regards those, however, that are not Brahmanas and that do not<br>endeavour to acquire knowledge of self, those practices should be<br>followed by them that are ordained for their respective orders in seasons<br>of distress or otherwise. Even that is the path followed by our fathers<br>and grandfathers before us and those also that had lived before them. As<br>regards those that are desirous of knowledge and avoiding to act, even<br>these also hold the same view and regard themselves as orthodox. I do<br>not, therefore, think that there is any other path. Whatsoever wealth<br>there may be in this earth, whatsoever there may be among the gods, or<br>whatsoever there may be unattainable by them,&#8212;the region of the<br>Prajapati, or heaven or the region of Brahma himself, I would not, O<br>Sanjaya, seek it by unrighteous means. Here is Krishna, the giver of<br>virtue's fruits, who is clever, politic, intelligent, who has waited upon<br>the Brahmanas, who knows everything' and counsels various mighty kings.<br>Let the celebrated Krishna say whether I would be censurable if I dismiss<br>all idea of peace, of whether if I fight, I should be abandoning the<br>duties of my caste, for Krishna seeketh the welfare of both sides. This<br>Satyaki, these Chedis, the Andhakas, the Vrishnis, the Bhojas, the<br>Kukuras, the Srinjayas, adopting the counsels of Krishna, slay their foes<br>and delight their friends. The Vrishnis and the Andhakas, at whose head<br>stands Ugrasena, led by Krishna, have become like Indra, high-spirited,<br>devoted to truth, mighty, and happy. Vabhru, the king of Kasi, having<br>obtained Krishna, that fructifier of wishes, as his brother, and upon<br>whom Krishna showers all the blessings of life, as the clouds upon all<br>earthly creatures, when the hot season is over, hath attained the highest<br>prosperity, O sire, so great is this Krishna! Him you must know as the<br>great judge of the propriety or otherwise of all acts. Krishna is dear to<br>us, and is the most illustrious of men. I never disregard what Krishna<br>sayeth.'"
