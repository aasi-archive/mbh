                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Entering her abode and worshipping her feet, Kesava<br>represented to her briefly all that had transpired in the assembly of the<br>Kurus. And Vasudeva said, 'Diverse words, worthy of being accepted and<br>fraught with reasons, were said both by myself and the Rishis, but<br>Duryodhana accepted them not. As regards Suyodhana and his followers,<br>their hour is come. With thy leave now, I shall speedily repair unto the<br>Pandavas. What should I say unto the Pandavas as thy instructions to<br>them? Tell me that, O thou endued with great wisdom. I desire to hear thy<br>words.'<br><br>"Kunti said, 'O Kesava, say unto king Yudhishthira of virtuous soul these<br>words, 'Thy virtue, O son, is decreasing greatly. Do not act vainly. O<br>king, like a reader of the Vedas incapable of catching their real<br>meaning, and, therefore, truly unlearned. Thy understanding, affected by<br>only the words of the Vedas, vieweth virtue alone. Cast thy eyes on the<br>duties of thy own order, as ordained by the Self-create. For all ruthless<br>deeds and for the protection of the people, from his (Brahmana's) arms<br>was created the Kshatriya, who is to depend upon the prowess of his own<br>arms. Listen, an instance is cited in this connection, that hath been<br>heard by me from the aged. In days of yore, Vaisravana, having been<br>gratified, made a gift of this Earth to the royal sage Muchukunda. The<br>latter without accepting the gift, said, 'I desire to enjoy that<br>sovereignty which is won by prowess of arms.' At this, Vaisravana was<br>highly delighted and filled with wonder. King Muchukunda then, fully<br>observing the duties of the Kshatriya order ruled this earth, having<br>conquered it by the prowess of his arms. Then again, a sixth part of the<br>virtue, practised by subjects well-protected by the king, is obtained, 'O<br>Bharata, by the king. The virtue again that the king himself practiseth<br>conferreth godhead on him, while if he perpetrateth sin, he goeth to<br>hell. The penal code properly applied by the ruler, maketh the four<br>orders adhere to their respective duties, and leadeth to an acquisition<br>(by the ruler himself) of virtue (profit, and salvation). When the king<br>properly abideth by the penal code, without making any portion of it a<br>dead letter, then that best of periods called the Krita Yuga setteth in.<br>Let not this doubt be thine, viz., whether the era is the cause of the<br>king, or the king the cause of the era, for (know this to be certain<br>that) the king is the cause of the era. It is the king that createth the<br>Krita, the Treta, or the Dwapara age. Indeed, it is the king that is the<br>cause of also the fourth Yuga (viz., the Kali). That king who causeth the<br>Krita age to set in, enjoyeth heaven exceedingly. That king who causeth<br>the Treta age to set in, doth enjoy heaven but not exceedingly. For thus<br>causing the Dwapara age to set in, a king enjoyeth heaven according to<br>his due. The king, however, who causeth the Kali age to set in, earneth<br>sin exceedingly. Thereupon, that king of wicked deeds resideth in hell<br>for countless years. Indeed, the king's sins affect the world, and the<br>world's sins affect him. Observe thou those kingly duties of thine that<br>befit thy ancestry. That is not the conduct of a royal sage in which thou<br>wishest to abide. Indeed, he that is stained by weakness of heart and<br>adhereth to compassion, and is unsteady, never obtaineth the merit born<br>of cherishing his subjects with love. That understanding according to<br>which thou art now acting was never wished (to thee) by Pandu, or myself,<br>or thy grandsire, while we uttered blessings on thee before; sacrifice,<br>gift, merit, and bravery, subjects and children, greatness of soul, and<br>might, and energy, these were always prayed by me for thee. Well-wishing<br>Brahmanas duly worshipped and gratified the gods and the Pitris for your<br>long life, wealth, and children, by adding Swaha and Swadha. The mother<br>and the father, as also the gods always desire for their children<br>liberality and gift and study and sacrifice and sway over subjects.<br>Whether all this be righteous or unrighteous, you are to practise it, in<br>consequence of your very birth. (Behold, O Krishna, so far from doing all<br>this), though born in a high race, they are yet destitute of the very<br>means of support, and are afflicted with misery. Hungry men, approaching<br>a brave and bountiful monarch, are gratified, and live by his side. What<br>virtue can be superior to this? A virtuous person, upon acquiring a<br>kingdom, should in this world make all persons his own, attaching some by<br>gift, some by force, and some by sweet words. A Brahmana should adopt<br>mendicancy; a Kshatriya should protect (subjects); a Vaisya should earn<br>wealth; and a Sudra should serve the other three. Mendicancy, therefore,<br>is forbidden to thee. Nor is agriculture suited to thee. Thou art a<br>Kshatriya and therefore, the protector of all in distress. Thou art to<br>live by the prowess of thy arms. O thou of mighty arms, recover thy<br>paternal share of the kingdom which thou hast lost, by conciliation, or<br>by working disunion among thy foes, or by gift of money or violence, or<br>well-directed policy. What can be a matter of greater grief than that I,<br>deprived of friends, should live upon food supplied by others, after<br>having brought thee forth, thou enhancer of the joys of friends? Fight,<br>according to the practices of kings. Do not sink thy ancestors (in<br>infamy). With thy merit worn out, do not, with thy younger brothers,<br>obtain a sinful end.'"
