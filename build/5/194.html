                            "Bhishma said. 'Then, O mighty-armed king, Sikhandin's mother represented<br>unto her lord the truth about her daughter, Sikhandin. And she said,<br>'Childless, O great king, as I was, from fear of my co-wives, when<br>Sikhandini, my daughter, was born, I represented unto you that it was a<br>son! For thy love of me, thou also hadst corroborated it, and, O bull<br>among kings, thou hadst performed all the rites prescribed for a son in<br>respect of this daughter of mine! Thou then didst marry her, O king, to<br>the daughter of the king of the Dasarnakas. I also approved of this act,<br>remembering the words of the (great) god! Indeed, I did not prevent it,<br>remembering the words of Siva,&#8212;Born a daughter, she will become a son!'<br>Hearing all this, Drupada, otherwise called Yajnasena, informed all his<br>counsellors of these facts. And, O monarch, the king then took counsel<br>with ministers for the proper protection of his subjects (from the<br>would-be invader). Although he had himself deceived the king of the<br>Dasarnakas, yet giving it out that the alliance he had made was proper,<br>he began to settle his plans with undivided attention. King Drupada's<br>city was, O Bharata, naturally well-protected. Yet at the advent of<br>danger, O monarch, they began to protect it all the more carefully and<br>fortify it (with defensive works). The king, however, with his queen, was<br>greatly afflicted, thinking of how a war might not take place with his<br>brother. Reflecting on this, he began to pay his adorations to the gods.<br>His respected wife, beholding him relying on the god and paying his<br>adorations to them, than addressed him, O king, and said, 'Homage to the<br>gods is productive of benefits! It is, therefore, approved by the<br>righteous. What shall I say, again, of those that are sunk in an ocean of<br>distress? Therefore, pay homage to those that are thy superiors and let<br>all the gods also be worshipped, making large presents the while (unto<br>the Brahmanas)! Let oblations be poured on the fire for pacifying the<br>ruler of the Dasarnakas. O lord, think of the means by which, without a<br>war, thou mayst be able to pacify thy brother! Through the grace of the<br>gods all this will happen. For the preservation of this city, O thou of<br>large eyes, thou hast taken counsel with thy ministers. Do all, O king,<br>that those counsels seem to indicate, for reliance on the gods, when<br>supported by human exertion, always, O king, leadeth to success, If these<br>two do not go hand-in-hand, success becometh unattainable. Therefore,<br>with all thy advisers, make such arrangements in thy city as are proper,<br>and pay homage, O monarch, as thou pleasest, to the gods.' While husband<br>and wife were conversing with each other thus, both filled with grief,<br>their helpless daughter, Sikhandini, was filled with shame. She then<br>reflected, saying, 'It is for me that these two are plunged into grief!'<br>Thinking so, she resolved upon putting an end to her own life. Having<br>formed this determination, she left home, filled with heavy sorrow, and<br>went into a dense and solitary forest that was the haunt, O king, of a<br>very formidable Yaksha called Sthunakarna. From fear of that Yaksha men<br>never went into that forest. And within it stood a mansion with high<br>walls and a gateway, plastered over with powdered earth, and rich with<br>smoke bearing the fragrance of fried paddy. Entering that mansion,<br>Sikhandini, the daughter of Drupada, O king, began to reduce herself by<br>foregoing all food for many days. Thereupon, the Yaksha named Sthuna, who<br>was endued with kindness, showed himself unto her. And he enquired of<br>her, saying, 'For what object is this endeavour of thine? I will<br>accomplish it, tell me without delay!' Thus asked, the maiden answered<br>him, repeatedly saying, 'Thou art unable to accomplish it!' The Guhyaka,<br>however, rejoined, without a moment's delay, saying, 'Accomplish it I<br>will! I am a follower of the Lord of treasures, I can, O princess, grant<br>boons! I will grant thee even that which cannot be given! Tell me what<br>thou hast to say!' Thus assured, Sikhandini represented in detail<br>everything that had happened, unto that chief of Yakshas called<br>Sthunakarna. And she said, 'My father, O Yaksha, will soon meet with<br>destruction. The ruler of the Dasarnakas marcheth against him in rage.<br>That king eased in golden mail is endued with great might and great<br>courage. Therefore, O Yaksha, save me, my mother, and my father! Indeed,<br>thou hast already pledged thyself to relieve my distress! Through thy<br>grace, O Yaksha, I would become a perfect man! As long as that king may<br>not depart from my city, so long, O great Yaksha, show me grace, O<br>Guhyaka!'"
