                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Like Duryodhana, king Yudhishthira also, the son of<br>Kunti and Dharma, ordered out, O Bharata, his heroic warriors headed by<br>Dhrishtadyumna. Indeed, he ordered that slayer of foes and commander of<br>force, that leader, steady in prowess, of the Chedis, the Kasis, and the<br>Karushas, viz., Dhrishtaketu, as also Virata, and Drupada, and Yuyudhana,<br>and Sikhandin, and those two mighty bowmen, those two princes of<br>Panchala, viz., Yudhamanyu and Uttamaujas, to set out. Those brave<br>warriors, cased in handsome coats of mail and decked with golden<br>ear-rings, blazed forth like fires on the sacrificial altar when fed with<br>clarified butter. Indeed, those mighty bowmen looked resplendent like the<br>planets in the firmament. Then that bull among men king Yudhishthira,<br>having duly honoured all his combatants, ordered them to march. And king<br>Yudhishthira ordered excellent provisions of food for those high-souled<br>kings with their troops consisting of infantry, and elephants and horses,<br>and with all their followers, as also for all those that subsisted on<br>mechanical arts. And the son of Pandu first ordered Abhimanyu, and<br>Vrihanta, and the five sons of Draupadi, to march with Dhrishtadyumna at<br>their head. And he then despatched Bhima, and Dhananjaya the son of<br>Pandu, in the second division of his forces. And the din made by the men<br>moving and running about for harnessing their steeds and elephants and<br>loading the cars with implements of battle, and the shouts of the<br>cheerful combatants, seemed to touch the very heavens. And last of all,<br>the king marched himself, accompanied by Virata and Drupada and the other<br>monarchs (on his side). And that army of fierce bowmen commanded by<br>Dhrishtadyumna, hitherto stationed in one place, but now extended into<br>columns for marching, looked like the (impetuous) current of Ganga. The<br>then intelligent Yudhishthira depending on his wisdom, disposed his<br>divisions in a different order, confounding the sons of Dhritarashtra.<br>And the son of Pandu ordered that those mighty bowmen, the (five) sons of<br>Draupadi and Abhimanyu, and Nakula, and Sahadeva, and all the<br>Prabhadrakas, and ten thousand horses, and two thousand elephants, and<br>ten thousand foot-soldiers, and five hundred cars, constituting the first<br>irresistible division of his army, should be placed under the command of<br>Bhimasena. And he placed in the middle division of his army Virata and<br>Jayatsena, and those two mighty car-warriors, viz., Yudhamanyu and<br>Uttamauja, the two high-souled princes of Panchala, both endued with<br>great prowess and both armed with mace and bow. And in this middle<br>division marched Vasudeva and Dhananjaya. There were (placed) combatants<br>highly accomplished in arms and burning with anger. Amongst them were<br>steeds ridden by brave warriors, and five thousand elephants, and crowds<br>of cars all around. And foot-soldiers in thousands, that were all brave<br>and armed with bows, swords, and maces, marched behind them, as thousand<br>marched before them. And in that part of that sea of troops, where<br>Yudhishthira himself was, there were stationed numerous lords of earth.<br>And there also were thousands of elephants, and steeds by ten thousands,<br>and cars and foot-soldiers also by thousands. And there also marched, O<br>bull among kings, Chekitana with his own large force, and king<br>Dhrishtaketu, the leader of the Chedis. And there also was that mighty<br>bowman, Satyaki, the foremost car-warrior of the Vrishnis, that mighty<br>combatant, surrounded by hundreds and thousands of cars and leading (them<br>to battle)! And those bulls among men, Kshatrahan and Kshatradeva,<br>mounted on their cars, marched behind, protecting the rear. And there (in<br>the rear) were the waggons, stalls, uniforms, vehicles and draft animals.<br>There also were thousands of elephants and horses by tens of thousands.<br>And taking all the invalids and women, and all that were emaciated and<br>weak, and all the animals carrying his treasures, and all his granaries,<br>with the aid of his elephant-divisions, Yudhishthira marched slowly. And<br>he was followed by Sauchitti, who steadily adhered to truth and was<br>invincible in battle, and Srenimat, and Vasudeva and Vibhu, the son of<br>the ruler of Kasi, with twenty thousand cars, and hundred million steeds<br>of high mettle, each bearing scores of bells on its limbs, and twenty<br>thousand smiting elephants with tusks as long as plough-shares, all of<br>good breed and divided temples and all resembling moving masses of<br>clouds. Indeed, these usually walked behind those monarchs. Besides<br>these, O Bharata, the elephants that Yudhishthira had in his seven<br>Akshauhinis, numbering seventy thousand with humour trickling down their<br>trunks and from their mouths, and resembling (on that account) showering<br>clouds, also followed the king, like moving hills.<br><br>'Thus was arrayed that terrible force of the intelligent son of Kunti.<br>And relying upon that force he battled with Suyodhana, the son of<br>Dhritarashtra. Besides those already named, other men by hundreds and<br>thousands and tens of thousands, in divisions numbering by thousands,<br>followed (the Pandava army), roaring loudly. And the warriors by<br>thousands and ten thousands, filled with joy, beat their drums by<br>thousands and blew conchs by tens of thousands!'"<br><br>The End of Udyoga Parva
