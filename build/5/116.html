                            "Narada said, 'That best of monarchs, king Haryyaswa, after reflecting<br>for a long while and breathing a long and hot sigh about the birth of a<br>son, at last said, 'Those six limbs[16] that ought to be high are high in<br>this maiden. Those seven, again, that ought to be slender are slender in<br>her. Those three, again, which ought to be deep are deep in her. And<br>lastly, those five that ought to be red are red in her. It seems that she<br>is worth being looked at by even the gods and the Asuras, and is<br>accomplished in all the arts and sciences. Possessed of all auspicious<br>signs, she will certainly bring forth many children. She is even capable<br>of bringing forth a son who may become an emperor. Having regard to my<br>wealth, tell me, O foremost of Brahmanas, what should be her dower.'<br>Galava said, 'Give me eight hundred steeds, born in a good country, of<br>lunar whiteness, and each with one ear black in hue. This auspicious and<br>large-eyed maiden will then become the mother of thy sons, like the<br>fire-stick becoming the genetrix of fire.'"<br><br>"Narada continued, 'Hearing these words, that royal sage, king Haryyaswa,<br>filled with sorrow, but blinded by lust, addressed Galava, that foremost<br>of Rishis, saying, 'I have only two hundred steeds about me of the kind<br>wanted by thee, although of other kinds all worthy of sacrifice, I have<br>many thousand moving about (in my dominions), O Galava, I desire to beget<br>only one son upon this damsel. Kindly grant this request of mine.'<br>Hearing these words of the king, that damsel said unto Galava, 'A reciter<br>of Brahma granted me a boon that I would after each delivery, be a maiden<br>again. Give me away, therefore, to this king, accepting his excellent<br>steeds. In this way, full eight hundred steeds may be obtained by thee<br>from four kings in succession, and I also may have four sons. Collect<br>thou the wealth intended for thy preceptor, in this way. Even this is<br>what I think. It depends, however, oil thee, O Brahmana, as to how thou<br>shouldst act.' Thus addressed by that maiden, the Muni Galava said these<br>words unto king Haryyaswa, 'O Haryyaswa, O best of men, accept this<br>damsel for a fourth part of the dower that I have settled, and beget only<br>one son upon her.' Taking then that maiden and worshipping Galava, the<br>king in due time and place had by her a son of the kind wished for. And<br>the son so born came to be called by the name of Vasumanas. Richer than<br>all the wealthy kings of the earth, and resembling one of the Vasus<br>themselves he became a king and giver of great wealth.<br><br>'After some time, intelligent Galava came back and approaching the<br>delighted Haryyaswa, said unto him, 'Thou hast, O king obtained a son.<br>Indeed, this child is like the sun himself in splendour. The time hath<br>come, O foremost of men, for me to go to some other king for alms.'<br>Hearing these words, Haryyaswa who was even truthful in speech and steady<br>in acts of manliness, and remembering that the balance of six hundred<br>steeds could not be made up by him, gave Madhavi back to Galava. And<br>Madhavi also, abandoning that blazing, kingly prosperity, and once more<br>becoming a maiden, followed the footsteps of Galava. And Galava too,<br>saying, 'Let the steeds remain with thee' then went, accompanied by the<br>maiden, to king Divodasa.'"
