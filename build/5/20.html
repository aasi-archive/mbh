                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Then Drupada's priest, having approached the Kaurava<br>chief, was honoured by Dhritarashtra as also by Bhishma and Vidura. And<br>having first told the news of the welfare of the Pandavas, he enquired<br>about the welfare of the Kauravas. And he spoke the following words in<br>the midst of all the leaders of Duryodhana's army, 'The eternal duties of<br>kings are known to you all. But though known, I shall yet recite them as<br>an introduction to what I am going to say. Both Dhritarashtra and Pandu<br>are known to be sons of the same father. There is no doubt that the share<br>of each to the paternal wealth should be equal. The sons of Dhritarashtra<br>obtained the paternal wealth. Why did not the sons of Pandu at all<br>receive their paternal portion? Ye are aware how formerly the sons of<br>Pandu did not receive their paternal property which was all usurped by<br>Dhritarashtra's sons. The latter endeavoured in various ways to remove<br>the sons of Pandu from their path by employment even of murderous<br>contrivances; but as their destined terms of life had not wholly run out,<br>the sons of Pandu could not be sent to the abode of Yama. Then again,<br>when those high-souled princes had carved out a kingdom by their own<br>strength, the mean-minded sons of Dhritarashtra, aided by Suvala's son,<br>robbed them of it by deceit. This Dhritarashtra gave his sanction even to<br>that act as hath been usual with him. And for thirteen years they were<br>then sent to sojourn in the great wilderness. In the council-hall, they<br>had also been subjected to indignities of various kinds, along with their<br>wife, valiant though they were. And great also were the sufferings that<br>they had to endure in the woods. Those virtuous princes had also to<br>endure unspeakable woes in the city of Virata,&#8212;such as are endured only<br>by vicious men when their souls transmigrate into the forms of inferior<br>beings, Ye best of Kuru's race, overlooking all these injuries of yore<br>they desire nothing but a peaceful settlement with the Kurus! Remembering<br>their behaviour, and that of Duryodhana also, the latter's friends should<br>entreat him to consent to peace! The heroic sons of Pandu are not eager<br>for war with the Kurus. They desire to get back their own share without<br>involving the world in ruin. If Dhritarashtra's son assigns a reason in<br>favour of war, that can never be a proper reason. The sons of Pandu are<br>more powerful. Seven Akshauhinis of troops have been collected on behalf<br>of Yudhishthira, all eager to fight with the Kurus, and they are now<br>awaiting his word of command. Others there are tigers among men, equal in<br>might to a thousand Akshauhinis, such as Satyaki and Bhimasena, and the<br>twin brothers of mighty strength. It is true that these eleven divisions<br>of troops are arrayed on one side, but these are balanced on the other by<br>the mighty-armed Dhananjaya of manifold form. And as Kiritin exceeds in<br>strength even all these troops together, so also doth Vasudeva's son of<br>great effulgence and powerful intellect. Who is there that would fight,<br>in view of the magnitude of the opposing force, the valour of Arjuna, and<br>the wisdom of Krishna? Therefore, I ask you to give back what should be<br>given, as dictated by morality and compact. Do not let the opportunity<br>pass!'"
