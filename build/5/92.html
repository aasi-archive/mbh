                            "Vaisampayana said, 'After Kesava had dined and been refreshed, Vidura<br>said unto him during the night, 'O Kesava, this advent of thine hath not<br>been a well judged one, for, O Janardana, Dhritarashtra's son<br>transgresseth the rules of both profit and religion, is wicked and<br>wrathful, insulteth others, though himself desirous of honours, and<br>disobeyeth the commands of the aged. He is, O Madhava, a transgressor of<br>the scriptures, ignorant, and of wicked soul, already overtaken by fate,<br>untractable, and disposed to do evil to those that seek his good. His<br>soul is possessed by desire and lust. He foolishly regardeth himself as<br>very wise. He is the enemy of all his true friends. Ever-suspicious,<br>without any control over his soul, and ungrateful, he hath abandoned all<br>virtue and is in love with sin. He is foolish, with understanding<br>uncultivated, a slave of his senses, ever obedient to the impulses of<br>lust and avarice, and irresolute in every act that should be done. He is<br>endued with these and many other vices. Although thou wilt point out to<br>him what is for his good, he will yet disregard it all, moved by pride<br>and anger. He hath great faith in Bhishma, and Drona, and Kripa, and<br>Karna, and Drona's son, and Jayadratha, and, therefore, he never setteth<br>his heart on peace, O Janardana. Dhritarashtra's sons, with Karna, firmly<br>believe that the Pandavas are incapable of even looking at Bhishma,<br>Drona, and other heroes, not to speak of fighting against them. The<br>foolish Duryodhana of limited sight, having assembled a huge army<br>regardeth, O slayer of Madhu, that his purposes are already achieved. The<br>foolish son of Dhritarashtra hath arrived at the conclusion that Karna,<br>single-handed, is competent to vanquish his foes. He will, therefore,<br>never make peace. Thou, O Kesava, desirest to establish peace and<br>brotherly feelings between the two parties. But know that all the sons of<br>Dhritarashtra have come to the conclusion that they would not give unto<br>the Pandavas what, indeed, the latter have a right to. With those that<br>are so resolved thy words will certainly prove vain. Where, O slayer of<br>Madhu, words, good or bad, are of the same effect, no wise man would<br>spend his breath for nothing, like a singer before the deaf. As a<br>Brahmana before a conclave of Chandalas, thy words, O Madhava, would<br>command no respect among those ignorant and wicked wretches that have no<br>reverence for all that deserveth reverence. Foolish, as long as he hath<br>strength, he will never obey thy counsels. Whatever words thou mayest<br>speak to him will be perfectly futile. It doth not seem proper to me, O<br>Krishna, that thou shouldst go into the midst of these wicked-minded<br>wretches seated together. It doth not seem proper to me, O Krishna, that<br>going thither thou shouldst utter words against those wicked-souled,<br>foolish, unrighteous wights, strong in number. In consequence of their<br>having never worshipped the aged, in consequence of their having been<br>blinded by prosperity and pride, and owing to the pride of youth and<br>wrath, they will never accept the good advice thou mayest place before<br>them. He hath mustered a strong force, O Madhava, and he hath his<br>suspicions of thyself. He will, therefore, never obey any counsel that<br>thou mayest offer. The sons of Dhritarashtra, O Janardana, are inspired<br>with the firm belief that at present Indra himself, at the head of all<br>the celestials, is incapable of defeating them in battle. Efficacious as<br>thy words always are, they will prove to be of no efficacy with persons<br>impressed with such a conviction and who always follow the impulses of<br>lust and wrath. Staying in the midst of his ranks of elephants and his<br>army consisting of cars and heroic infantry, the foolish and wicked<br>Duryodhana, with all fears dispelled, regardeth the whole earth to have<br>already been subjugated by him. Indeed, Dhritarashtra's son coveteth<br>extensive empire on the earth without any rivals. Peace, therefore, with<br>him is unattainable. That which he hath in his possession he regardeth as<br>unalterably his. Alas, the destruction on the earth seems to be at hand<br>for the sake of Duryodhana, for, impelled by fate, the kings of the<br>earth, with all the Kshatriya warriors, have assembled together, desirous<br>of battling with the Pandavas? All those kings, O Krishna, are in enmity<br>with thee and have all been deprived of their possessions before this by<br>thee. Through fear of thee those heroic monarchs have joined together<br>with Karna and made an alliance with Dhritarashtra's sons. Reckless of<br>their very lives, all those warriors have united with Duryodhana and are<br>filled with delight at the prospect of fighting the Pandavas. O hero of<br>Dasarha's race, it doth not commend itself to me that thou shouldst enter<br>into their midst. How, O grinder of foes, wilt thou repair into the midst<br>of those numerous enemies of thine, of wicked souls, and seated together?<br>O thou of mighty arms, thou art, indeed, incapable of being vanquished by<br>the very gods, and I know, O slayer of foes, thy manliness and<br>intelligence. O Madhava, the love I bear to thee is equal to that I bear<br>to the sons of Pandu. I say, therefore, these words to thee from my<br>affection, regard, and friendship for thee. What need is there in<br>expressing to thee the delight that has been mine at sight of thy<br>persons, for, thou, O thou of eyes like lotus, art the inner Soul of all<br>embodied creatures.'"
