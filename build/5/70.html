                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'I request thee, O Sanjaya, to tell me again of the<br>lotus-eyed Krishna; for, by being acquainted with the import of his<br>names, I may, O son, obtain that most exalted of male beings.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'The auspicious names (of Kesava) have been previously<br>heard by me. Of those I will tell thee as many as I know. Kesava,<br>however, is immeasurable, being above the power of speech to describe. He<br>is called Vasudeva in consequence of his enveloping all creatures with<br>the screen of illusion, or of his glorious splendour, or of his being the<br>support and resting-place of the gods. He is called Vishnu because of his<br>all-pervading nature. He is called Madava, O Bharata, because of his<br>practising as a Muni, concentration of mind on truth and Yoga-absorption.<br>He is called Madhusudana because of his having slain the Asura Madhu, and<br>also because of his being the substance of the twenty-four objects of<br>knowledge. Born of the Sattwata race, he is called Krishna because he<br>uniteth in himself what are implied by the two words Krishi which<br>signifieth 'what existeth' and na which signifieth 'eternal peace'. He is<br>called Pundarikaksha from Pundarika implying his high and eternal abode,<br>and Aksha implying 'indestructible'; and he is called Janardana because<br>he striketh fear into the hearts of all wicked beings. He is called<br>Sattwata, because the attribute of Sattwa is never dissociated from him<br>and also because he is never dissociated from it; and he is called<br>Vrishabhakshana from Vrishabha implying the 'Vedas' and ikshana implying<br>'eye', the union of the two signifying that the Vedas are his eyes, or<br>the Vedas are the eyes through which he may be seen, That conqueror of<br>hosts is called Aja, or unborn', because he hath not taken his birth from<br>any being in the ordinary way. That Supreme Soul is called Damodara<br>because unlike the gods his effulgence is increate and his own, and also<br>because he hath self-control and great splendour. He is called<br>Hrishikesa, from Hrishika meaning 'eternal happiness' and Isa meaning<br>'the six divine attributes', the union signifying one having joy,<br>happiness, and divinity. He is called Mahavahu, because he upholdeth the<br>earth and the sky with his two arms. He is called Adhakshaja, because he<br>never falleth down or suffereth any deterioration, and is called Narayana<br>from his being the refuge of all human beings. He is called Purusottama<br>from Puru implying 'he that createth and preserveth' and so meaning 'he<br>that destroyeth, the union signifying one that createth, preserveth, and<br>destroyeth the universe'. He possesseth a knowledge of all things, and,<br>therefore, is called Sarva, Krishna is always in Truth and Truth is<br>always in him, and Govinda is Truth's Truth. Therefore, he is called<br>Satya. He is called Vishnu because of his prowess, and Jishnu because of<br>his success. He is called Ananta from his eternity, and Govinda from his<br>knowledge of speech of every kind. He maketh the unreal appear as real<br>and thereby beguileth all creatures. Possessed of such attributes, ever<br>devoted to righteousness, and endued with divinity, the slayer of Madhu,<br>that mighty-armed one incapable of decay, will come hither for preventing<br>the slaughter of the Kurus.'"
