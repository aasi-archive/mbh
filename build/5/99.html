                            "Narada continued, 'Here in the very centre of the world of the Nagas is<br>situated the city known by the name of Patalam. Celebrated over all the<br>universe, it is worshipped by the Daityas and the Danavas. Creatures<br>inhabiting the earth, if brought hither by force of the water's current,<br>shriek loudly, afflicted with fear. Here the fire known by the name of<br>the Asura-fire[8] and which is fed by water, continually blazeth forth.<br>Held fast by the flat of the celestials, it moveth not, regarding itself<br>as bound and confined. It was here that' the gods, having first<br>vanquished and slain their foes, quaffed the Amrita and deposited the<br>residue. It is from this place that the waning and waxing of the moon are<br>seen. It is here that son of Aditi, the Horse-headed (Vishnu), on the<br>recurrence of every auspicious occasion, riseth, filling at such times<br>the universe, otherwise called Suvarna,[9] with the sound of Vedic hymns<br>and Mantras. And because all watery forms such as the Moon and others<br>shower their water on the region, therefore hath this excellent region<br>been called Patala.[10] It is from here that the celestial elephant<br>Airavata, for the benefit of the universe, taketh up cool water in order<br>to impart it to the clouds, and it is that water which Indra poureth down<br>as rain. Here dwell diverse kinds of aquatic animals, of various shapes<br>such as the Timi and others, which subsist on the rays of the moon. O<br>charioteer, here are many kinds of creatures that die during the day,<br>being pierced by the rays of the sun, but all of whom revive in the<br>night, the reason being that the moon, rising here every day, laying<br>those deceased creatures with Amrita by means of rays, that constitute<br>his arms, resuscitate them by that touch. Deprived of their prosperity by<br>Vasava, it is here that many sinful Danavas live confined, defeated by<br>him and afflicted by Time. It was here that the Lord of creatures&#8212;that<br>great Master of all created things&#8212;Mahadeva&#8212;had practised the severest<br>of ascetic austerities for the benefit of all creatures. Here dwell many<br>regenerate and great Rishis observant of vows called 'Go' and emaciated<br>with the recitation and study of the Vedas, and who, having suspended the<br>vital air called Prana, have attained to heaven by force of their<br>austerities. A man is said to adopt the vow called Go, when he sleepeth<br>wherever he listeth, and when he subsisteth on anything that others place<br>before him, and is clad with robes that others may supply. Here in the<br>race of the celebrated elephant Supratika were born those best of<br>elephants known by the names of Airavata, Vamana, Kumuda and Anjana, the<br>first being the king of his tribe. Look, O Matali, if there be any<br>bridegroom here, that is distinguished by the possession of superior<br>merits, for then I will go to him for respectfully soliciting him to<br>accept thy daughter. Behold, here lieth an egg in these waters, blazing<br>with beauty. From the commencement of the creation it is here. It moveth<br>not, nor doth it burst. I have never heard any body speaking of its birth<br>or nature. Nobody knoweth who its father or mother is. It is said, O<br>Matali, that when the end of the world cometh, mighty fire burst forth<br>from within it, and spreading consumeth the three worlds with all their<br>mobile and immobile objects.' Hearing those words of Narada, Matali<br>answered him, saying, 'No one here seems to me to be eligible. Let us go<br>hence, therefore, without delay!'"
