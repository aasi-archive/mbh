                            "Janamejaya said, 'Interminably wedded to evil, blinded by avarice,<br>addicted to wicked courses, resolved upon bringing destruction on his<br>head, inspiring grief in the hearts of kinsmen, enhancing the woes of<br>friends, afflicting all his well-wishers, augmenting the joys of foes,<br>and treading the wrong path, why did not his friends seek to restrain<br>him, and why also did not that great friend (of Kuru's race), the holy<br>One; with tranquil soul, or the Grandsire tell him anything from<br>affection?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Yes, the holy one did speak. Bhishma also spoke what<br>was beneficial. And Narada too said much. Listen to all that these said.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Narada said, 'Persons that listen to the<br>counsels of friends are rare. Friends again are rare that offer<br>beneficial counsels, for a friend (in need of counsel) is never there<br>where a friend (offering counsel) is. O son of Kuru's race, I think, the<br>word of friends ought to be listened to. Obstinacy ought to be avoided;<br>for it is fraught with great evil. In this connection is cited an old<br>story regarding Galava's having met with disgrace through obstinacy. In<br>ancient times, in order to test Viswamitra, who was then engaged in<br>ascetic austerities Dharma personally came to him, having assumed the<br>form of the Rishi, Vasishtha. Thus assuming, O Bharata, the form of the<br>one of the seven Rishis, and feigning himself hungry and desirous of<br>eating, he came, O king, to the hermitage of Kausika. Thereupon,<br>Viswamitra struck with awe, began to cook Charu (which was a preparation<br>of rice and milk). And in consequence of the care he took in preparing<br>that excellent food, he could not properly wait upon his guest. And it<br>was not till after the guest had dined on the food offered by the other<br>hermits that Viswamitra succeeded in approaching him with the Charu he<br>had cooked and which was still steaming. 'I have already dined; wait<br>here,'&#8212;were the words that the holy one said. And having said that the<br>holy one went away. And thereupon, the illustrious Viswamitra, O king,<br>waited there. And bearing that food on his head and holding it with his<br>arms, that ascetic of rigid vow stood in his hermitage, still as a post,<br>subsisting on air. And as he stood there, an ascetic of the name of<br>Galava, from motives of respect and reverence and from affection and<br>desire of doing what was agreeable, began to wait upon him. And after a<br>hundred years had passed away, Dharma, again assuming the form of<br>Vasishtha, came to Kausika from desire of eating. And beholding the great<br>Rishi Viswamitra, who was endued with high wisdom, standing there with<br>that food on his head, himself subsisting all the while on air, Dharma<br>accepted that food which was still warm and fresh. And having eaten that<br>food, the god said,&#8212;Gratified am I, O regenerate Rishi. And saying this,<br>he went away. And at those words of Dharma, Viswamitra divested of<br>Kshatriyahood because endued with the status of a Brahmana and was filled<br>with delight[12]. And pleased as he was with the services and devotion of<br>his discipline, the ascetic Galava, Viswamitra, addressed him and said,<br>'With my leave, O Galava, go whithersoever thou mayest wish.' Thus<br>commanded by his preceptor, Galava, highly pleased, said in a sweet voice<br>unto Viswamitra of great effulgence, What final gift shall I make thee in<br>consequence of thy services as preceptor? O giver of honours, it is in<br>consequence of the (final) present that a sacrifice becometh successful.<br>The giver of such gifts obtains emancipation. Indeed, these gifts<br>constitute the fruit (that one enjoys in heaven). They are regarded as<br>peace and tranquillity personified. What, therefore, shall I procure for<br>my preceptor? Oh, let that be said. 'The illustrious Viswamitra knew that<br>he had really been conquered by Galava by means of the latter's services,<br>and the Rishi, therefore, sought to dismiss him by repeatedly saying,<br>'Go, Go.' But thou repeatedly commanded by Viswamitra to go away, Galava<br>still addressed him saying, 'What shall I give?' And seeing this<br>obstinacy on the part of ascetic Galava, Viswamitra felt a slight rise of<br>anger and at last said, 'Give me eight hundred steeds, every one of which<br>should be as white as the rays of the moon, and every one of which should<br>have one ear black. Go now, O Galava, and tarry not.'"
