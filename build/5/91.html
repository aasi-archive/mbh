                            "Vaisampayana said, 'With Pritha's leave and having walked round her, the<br>chastiser of foes, Govinda, also called Sauri, went to Duryodhana's<br>palace that was furnished with great wealth, adorned with beautiful<br>seats, and was like unto the abode of Purandara himself. Unobstructed by<br>the orderlies-in-waiting, that hero of great fame crossed three spacious<br>yards in succession and then entered that mansion looking like a mass of<br>clouds, high as the summit of a hill, and blazing forth in splendour. And<br>he there beheld Dhritarashtra's son of mighty arms seated on his throne<br>in the midst of a thousand kings and surrounded by all the Kurus. And he<br>also beheld there Dussasana and Karna and Sakuni, the son of Suvala,<br>seated on their respective seats by the side of Duryodhana. And on that<br>scion of Dasarha's race entering the court, Dhritarashtra's son of great<br>fame rose up from his seat with his counsellors for honouring the slayer<br>of Madhu. And Kesava then greeted Dhritarashtra's sons and all his<br>counsellors as also all the kings that were present there, according to<br>their respective ages. And Achyuta of Vrishni's race then took his seat<br>on a beautiful seat made of gold and overlaid with carpet embroidered<br>with gold. And the Kuru king then offered unto Janardana a cow, and honey<br>and curds and water, and placed at his service palaces and mansions and<br>the whole kingdom. And then the Kauravas, with all the kings there<br>present, worshipped Govinda on his seat and resembling the sun himself in<br>splendour. The worship being over, king Duryodhana invited him of<br>Vrishni's race&#8212;that foremost of victors&#8212;to eat at his house, Kesava,<br>however did not accept the invitation. The Kuru king Duryodhana seated in<br>the midst of the Kurus, in a gentle voice but with deception lurking<br>behind his words, eyeing Karna, and addressing Kesava, then said, 'Why, O<br>Janardana, dost thou not accept the diverse kinds of viands and drinks,<br>robes and beds that have all been prepared and kept ready for thee? Thou<br>hast granted aid to both sides; thou art engaged in the good of both<br>parties. Thou art again the foremost of Dhritarashtra's relations and<br>much loved by him. Thou, O Govinda, also knowest fully, and all things in<br>details, both religion and profit. I, therefore, desire to hear, O bearer<br>of the discus and the mace, what the true reason is of this thy refusal.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The high-souled Govinda, of eyes like lotus<br>leaves, then raising his mighty (right) arm, and in a voice deep as that<br>of the clouds, replied unto the king in excellent words fraught with<br>reasons,&#8212;words that were clear, distinct, correctly pronounced, and<br>without a single letter dropped, saying, 'Envoys, O king, eat and accept<br>worship only after the success of their missions. Therefore, O Bharata,<br>after my mission becomes successful, thou mayest entertain me and my<br>attendants.' Thus answered, Dhritarashtra's son again said unto<br>Janardana, It behoveth thee not, O Kesava, to behave towards us in this<br>way, Whether thou becomest successful, or unsuccessful, we are<br>endeavouring to please thee, O slayer of Madhu, because of thy<br>relationship with us. It seems, however, that all our efforts. O thou of<br>Dasarha's race, are fruitless. Nor do we see the reason, O slayer of<br>Madhu, in consequence of which, O foremost of men, thou acceptest not the<br>worship offered by us from love and friendship. With thee, O Govinda, we<br>have no hostility, no war. Therefore, on reflection, it will seem to thee<br>that words such as these scarcely become thee.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by the king, Janardana of<br>Dasarha's race, casting his eyes on Dhritarashtra's son and ah his<br>counsellors, replied, saying, 'Not from desire, nor from wrath, nor from<br>malice, nor for gain, nor for the sake of argument, nor from temptation,<br>would I abandon virtue. One taketh another's food when one is in<br>distress. At present, however, O king, thou hast not inspired love in me<br>by any act of thine, nor have I myself been plunged into distress.<br>Without any reason, O king, thou hatest, from the moment of their birth,<br>thy dear and gentle brothers,&#8212;the Pandavas&#8212;endued with every virtue.<br>This unreasonable hatred of thine for the sons of Pritha ill becometh<br>thee. The sons of Pandu are all devoted to virtue. Who, indeed, can do<br>them the least injury? He that hateth them, hateth me; he that loveth<br>them, loveth me. Know that the virtuous Pandavas and my own self have but<br>a common soul. He, who, following the impulses of lust and wrath, and<br>from darkness of soul, hateth and seeketh to injure one that is possessed<br>of every good quality, is regarded as the vilest of men. That wrathful<br>wretch of every good quality, is regarded as the vilest of men. That<br>wrathful wretch of uncontrolled soul, who, from ignorance and avarice<br>hateth his kinsmen endued with every auspicious quality, can never enjoy<br>his prosperity long. He, on the other hand, who, by good offices, winneth<br>over persons endued with good qualities, even if he beareth aversion of<br>them within his heart, enjoyeth prosperity and fame for ever and ever.<br>Defiled by wickedness, all this food, therefore, deserveth not to be<br>eaten by me. The food supplied by Vidura alone, should, I think, be eaten<br>by me.'<br><br>'Having said this unto Duryodhana who was ever incapable of bearing<br>anything against his own wishes, Kesava of mighty arms then came out of<br>that blazing palace of Dhritarashtra's son. And the high-souled Vasudeva<br>of mighty arms, coming out of that mansion, directed his steps towards<br>the abode of the illustrious Vidura. And while that mighty-armed one<br>staying within Vidura's abode, thither came unto him Drona, and Kripa,<br>and Bhishma, and Vahlika, and many of the Kauravas. And the Kauravas that<br>came there addressed Madhava, the heroic slayer of Madhu, saying, 'O thou<br>of Vrishni's race, we place at thy disposal our houses with all the<br>wealth within them.'<br><br>'The slayer of Madhu, of mighty energy, answered them saying, 'Ye may go<br>away. I am much honoured by these your offers.' And after all the Kurus<br>had gone away, Vidura, with great care entertained that unvanquished hero<br>of Dasarha's race with every object of desire. And Kunti then placed<br>before the illustrious Kesava clean and savoury food in abundance.<br>Therewith the slayer of Madhu first gratified the Brahmanas. Indeed, from<br>that food he first gave a portion, along with much wealth, unto a number<br>of Brahmanas conversant with the Vedas, and then with his attendants,<br>like Vasava in the midst of the Marutas, he dined on what remained of the<br>clean and savoury food supplied by Vidura.'"
