                            "Dhritarashtra said, After Falguni had vowed the slaughter of Bhishma in<br>battle, what did my wicked sons headed by Duryodhana do? Alas, I already<br>behold my father, Ganga's son, slain in battle, by that bowman of firm<br>grasp, viz., Partha, having Vasudeva for his ally! And what also did that<br>mighty bowman, that foremost of smiters, Bhishma, endued with<br>immeasurable wisdom, say on hearing the words of Partha. Having accepted<br>also the command of the Kauravas, what did that foremost of warriors,<br>Ganga's son, of exceeding intelligence and prowess, do?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus questioned, Sanjaya told him everything<br>about what that eldest one of the Kurus, Bhishma of immeasurable energy,<br>had said.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'O monarch, obtaining the command, Bhishma, the son of<br>Santanu said these words unto Duryodhana, gladdening him greatly,<br>'Worshipping the leader of celestial forces, viz., Kumara, armed with the<br>lance, I shall, without doubt, be the commander of thy army today! I am<br>well-versed in all mighty affairs, as also in various kinds of array. I<br>know also how to make regular soldiers and volunteers act their parts. In<br>the matter of marching the troops and arraying them, in encounters and<br>withdrawing, I am as well-versed, O great king, as Vrihaspati (the<br>preceptor of the celestials), is! I am acquainted with all the methods of<br>military array prevalent amongst the celestials, Gandharvas, and human<br>beings. With these I will confound the Pandavas. Let thy (heart's) fever<br>be dispelled. I will fight (the foe), duly protecting thy army and<br>according to the rules of (military) science! O king, let thy heart's<br>fever be dispelled!'<br><br>Hearing these words, Duryodhana said, 'O Ganga's son of mighty arms, I<br>tell thee truly, I have no fear from even all the gods and Asuras united<br>together! How much less, therefore, is my fear when thy invincible self<br>hath become the leader of my forces and when that tiger among men, Drona,<br>also waiteth willingly for battle! When you two foremost of men, are<br>addressed for battle on my side, victory, nay, the sovereignty of even<br>the celestial cannot assuredly be unattainable by me! I desire, however,<br>O Kaurava, to know who amongst all the warriors of the foe and my own are<br>to be counted as Rathas and who Atirathas. Thou, O grandsire, art<br>well-acquainted with the (prowess of the) combatants of the foe, also of<br>ourselves! I desire to hear this, with all these lords of earth!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen, O son of Gandhari, O king of kings, to the tale<br>of Rathas in thy own army! Hear, O king, as to who are Rathas and who<br>Atirathas! They are in thy army, many thousands, many millions, and many<br>hundreds of millions of Rathas. Listen, however, to me as I name only the<br>principal ones. Firstly, with thy country of brothers including Dussasana<br>and others, thou art of the foremost of Rathas! All of you are skilled in<br>striking, and proficient in cutting chariots and piercing. All of you are<br>accomplished drivers of chariots while seated in the driver's box, and<br>accomplished managers of elephants while seated on the necks of those<br>animals. All of you are clever smiters with maces and bearded darts and<br>swords and bucklers. You are accomplished in weapons and competent in<br>bearing burthens of responsibility. Ye all are disciples of Drona and of<br>Kripa, the son of Saradwat, in arrows and other arms. Wronged by the sons<br>of Pandu, these Dhartarashtras, endued with energy, will assuredly slay<br>in the encounter the Panchalas irresistible in combat. Then, O foremost<br>of the Bharatas, come I, the leader of all thy troops, who will<br>exterminate thy foes, vanquishing the Pandavas! It behoveth me not to<br>speak of my own merits. I am known to thee. The foremost of all wielders<br>of weapons, Bhoja (chief) Kritavarman is Atiratha. Without doubt, he will<br>accomplish thy purpose in battle. Incapable of being humiliated by<br>persons accomplished in arms, shooting or hurling his weapons to a great<br>distance, and a severe smiter, he will destroy the ranks of the foe, as<br>the great Indra destroying the Danavas. The ruler of the Madras, the<br>mighty bowman Salya, is, as I think, an Atiratha. That warrior boasteth<br>himself as Vasudeva's equal, in every battle (that he fighteth). Having<br>abandoned his own sister's sons, that best of kings, Salya, hath become<br>thine. He will encounter in battle the Maharathas of the Pandava party,<br>flooding the enemy with his arrows resembling the very surges of the sea.<br>The mighty bowman Bhurisravas, the son of Somadatta, who is accomplished<br>in arms and is one of thy well-meaning friends, is a leader of leaders of<br>car-divisions. He will, certainly, make a great havoc among the<br>combatants of thy enemies. The king of the Sindhus, O monarch, is in my<br>judgment, equal to two Rathas. That best of car-warriors will fight in<br>battle, displaying great prowess. Humiliated, O king, by the Pandavas on<br>the occasion of his, abducting Draupadi, and bearing that humiliation in<br>mind, that slayer of hostile heroes will fight (for thee). Having<br>practised after that, O king, the severest austerities, he obtained a<br>boon, highly difficult of acquisition, for encountering the Pandavas in<br>battle. That tiger among car-warriors, therefore, remembering his old<br>hostility, will, O sire, fight with the Pandavas in battle, reckless of<br>his very life which is so difficult to lay down.'"
