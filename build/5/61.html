                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing these words of his father, the passionate<br>son of Dhritarashtra inflamed with great wrath, again said these words,<br>of envy, of 'Thou thinkest the Parthas having the celestials for their<br>allies, are incapable of being vanquished. Let this thy fear, O best of<br>kings, be dispelled. The gods attained to their divinity for absence of<br>desire, covetousness, and of enmity, as also for their indifference to<br>all worldly affairs. Formerly, Dwaipayana-Vyasa and Narada of great<br>ascetic austerities, and Rama, the son of Jamadagni, told us this. The<br>gods never like human beings engage in work, O bull of the Bharata race,<br>from desire, or wrath, or covetousness, or envy. Indeed, if Agni, or<br>Vayu, or Dharma, or Indra, or the Aswins had ever engaged themselves in<br>works from worldly desire, then the sons of Pritha could never have<br>fallen into distress. Do not, therefore, by any means, indulge in such<br>anxiety, because the gods, O Bharata, always set their eyes on affairs<br>worthy of themselves. If, however, envy or lust become noticeable in the<br>gods in consequence of their yielding to desire, then, according to what<br>has been ordained by the gods themselves, such envy or Just can never<br>prevail. Charmed by me, Agni will be instantly extinguished, even if he<br>blazes up all around for consuming all creatures. The energy with which<br>the gods are endued is, indeed, great, but know, O Bharata, that mine is<br>greater than that of the gods. If the Earth herself cleaves in twain, or<br>mountain crests split, I can re-unite them, O king, by my incantations<br>before the eyes of all. If for the destruction of this universe of<br>animate and inanimate, mobile and immobile creatures, there happeneth a<br>terrific tempest or stony shower of loud roar, I can always, from<br>compassion for created beings, stop it before the eyes of all. When the<br>waters are solidified by me, even cars and infantry can move over them.<br>It is I who set agoing all the affairs of both gods and Asuras. Unto<br>whatever countries I go with my Akshauhinis on any mission, my steeds<br>move whithersoever I desire. Within my dominions there are no fearful<br>snakes, and protected by my incantations, creatures within my territories<br>are never injured by others that are frightful. The very clouds, O king,<br>pour, as regards those dwelling in my dominions, showers as much as they<br>desire and when they desire. All my subjects, again, are devoted to<br>religion and are never subject to calamities of season. The Aswins, Vayu,<br>Agni, Indra with the Maruts, and Dharma will not venture to protect my<br>foes. If these had been able to protect by their might my adversaries,<br>never would the sons of Pritha have fallen into such distress for three<br>and ten years. I tell thee truly that neither gods, nor Gandharvas nor<br>Asuras nor Rakshasas are capable of saving him who hath incurred my<br>displeasure; I have never before been baffled as regards the reward to<br>punishment that I intended to bestow or inflict on friend or foe. If<br>ever, O repressor of foes, I said this is to be,&#8212;that hath always been.<br>People, therefore, have always known me as a speaker of truth. All<br>persons can bear witness to my greatness, the fame of which hath spread<br>all around. I mention this, O king, for thy information and not from<br>pride. Never had I, O king, praised myself before, for to praise one's<br>own self is mean. Thou wilt hear of defeat of the Pandavas and the<br>Matsyas, the Panchalas and the Kekayas, of Satyaki and Vasudeva, at my<br>hands. Indeed, as rivers, on entering the ocean, are entirely lost in it,<br>so the Pandavas with all their followers, on approaching me, will all be<br>annihilated. My intelligence is superior, my energy is superior, my<br>prowess is superior, my knowledge is superior, my resources are superior<br>by far to those of the Pandavas. Whatever knowledge of weapons is in the<br>Grandsire, in Drona, and Kripa, and Salya, and Shalya, exist in me as<br>well.<br><br>'Having said these words, O Bharata, Duryodhana, that repressor of foes,<br>again asked Sanjaya, in order to ascertain the proceedings of<br>Yudhishthira bent upon war.'"
