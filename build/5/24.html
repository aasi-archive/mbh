                            "Sanjaya said, 'It is even so as thou hast said, O son of Pandu! Dost<br>thou enquire about the welfare of the Kurus and of the foremost ones<br>among them? Free from illness of every kind and in the possession of<br>excellent spirit are those foremost ones among the Kurus about whom, O<br>son of Pritha, thou enquirest. Know, O son of Pandu, that there are<br>certainly righteous and aged men, as also men that are sinful and wicked<br>about Dhritarashtra's son. Dhritarashtra's son would make gifts even to<br>his enemies; it is not likely, therefore, that he should withdraw the<br>donations made to the Brahmanas. It is customary with you, Kshatriyas, to<br>follow a rule fit for butchers, that leads you to do harm to those that<br>bear no ill-will to you; but the practice is not good. Dhritarashtra with<br>his sons would be guilty of the sin of intestine dissension, where he,<br>like a bad man, to bear ill-will towards you who are righteous. He does<br>not approve of this injury (done to you); he is exceedingly sorry for it;<br>he grieves at his heart-the old man&#8212;O Yudhishthira,&#8212;for, having<br>communicated with the Brahmanas, he hath learnt that provoking intestine<br>dissensions is the greatest of all sins. O king of men, they remember thy<br>prowess on the field, and that of Arjuna, who taketh the lead in the<br>field of battle. They remember Bhima wielding his mace when the sound of<br>the conch-shell and the drum rises to the highest pitch. They remember<br>those mighty car-warriors, the two sons of Madri, who on the field of<br>battle career in all directions, shooting incessant showers of shafts on<br>hostile hosts, and who know not what it is to tremble in fight. I<br>believe, O king, that which Futurity hath in store for a particular<br>person cannot be known, since thou, O son of Pandu, who art endowed with<br>all the virtues, hast had to suffer trouble of such unendurable kind. All<br>this, no doubt, O Yudhishthira, thou wilt again make up by help of your<br>intelligence. The sons of Pandu, all equal to Indra would never abandon<br>virtue for the sake of pleasure. Thou, O Yudhishthira, wilt so make up<br>thy intelligence that they all, viz., the sons of Dhritarashtra and Pandu<br>and the Srinjayas, and all the kings who have been assembled here, will<br>attain peace. O Yudhishthira, bear what thy sire Dhritarashtra having<br>consulted with his ministers and sons, hath spoken to me. Be attentive to<br>the same.'"
