                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'What is the object of asceticism (mauna)? Of the<br>two kinds of mauna (viz., the restraining of speech and meditation),<br>which is approved by thee? O learned one, tell me the true aspect of<br>mauna. Can a person of learning attain to a state of quietude and<br>emancipation (moksha) by that mauna? O Muni, how also is asceticism<br>(mauna) to be practised here?'<br><br>"Sanat-sujata said, 'Since the Supreme Soul cannot be penetrated by both<br>the Vedas and the mind, it is for this that Soul itself is called mauna.<br>That from which both the Vedic syllable Om and this one (ordinary sounds)<br>have arisen, that One, O king, is displayed as the Word.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Is he that knoweth both the Rig and the Yajus<br>Vedas, is he that knoweth the Sama Veda, sullied by sins or not when he<br>commiteth sins?'<br><br>"Sanat-sujata said, 'I tell thee truly that the man that hath not<br>restrained his senses is not rescued from his sinful acts by either the<br>Sama or the Rig, or the Yajus Veda. The Vedas never rescue from sin the<br>deceitful person living by deceit. On the other hand, like newfledged<br>birds forsaking their nest, the Vedas forsake such a person at the end.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'O thou that hast restrained thy senses, if, indeed,<br>the Vedas are not competent to rescue a person without the aid of virtue,<br>whence then is this delusion of the Brahmanas that the Vedas are always<br>destructive of sins?'<br><br>"Sanat-sujata said, 'O magnanimous one, this universe hath sprung from<br>that Supreme Soul by the union of Conditions respecting name, form, and<br>other attributes. The Vedas also, pointing it out duly, declare the same,<br>and inculcate that the Supreme Soul and the universe are different and<br>not identical. It is for attaining to that Supreme Soul that asceticism<br>and sacrifices are ordained, and it is by these two that the man of<br>learning earneth virtue. Destroying sin by virtue, his soul is<br>enlightened by knowledge. The man of knowledge, by the aid of knowledge,<br>attaineth to the Supreme Soul. Otherwise, he that coveteth the four<br>objects of human pursuit, taking with him all that he doth here, enjoyeth<br>their fruits hereafter, and (as those fruits) are not everlasting cometh<br>back to the region of action (when the enjoyment is over). Indeed, the<br>fruits of ascetic austerities performed in this world have to be enjoyed<br>in the other world (as regards those persons who have not obtained the<br>mastery of their souls). As regards those Brahmanas employed in ascetic<br>practices (who have the mastery of their souls), even these regions are<br>capable of yielding fruits.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'O Sanat-sujata, how can ascetic austerities which<br>are all of the same kind, be sometimes successful and sometimes<br>unsuccessful? Tell us this in order that we may know it!'<br><br>"Sanat-sujata said, 'That asceticism which is not stained by (desire and<br>other) faults is said to be capable of procuring emancipation, and is,<br>therefore, successful, while the asceticism that is stained by vanity and<br>want of true devotion is regarded unsuccessful. All thy enquiries, O<br>Kshatriya, touch the very root of asceticism. It is by asceticism that<br>they that are learned, know Brahman and win immortality!'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'I have listened to what thou hast said about<br>asceticism unstained by faults, and by which I have succeeded in knowing<br>an eternal mystery. Tell me now, O Sanat-sujata, about asceticism that is<br>stained by faults!'<br><br>"Sanat-sujata said, 'O king, the twelve, including anger, as also the<br>thirteen kinds of wickedness, are the faults of asceticism that is<br>stained. Anger, lust, avarice, ignorance of right and wrong, discontent,<br>cruelty, malice, vanity, grief, love of pleasure, envy, and speaking ill<br>of others, are generally the faults of human beings. These twelve should<br>always be avoided by men. Any one amongst these can singly effect the<br>destruction of men, O bull among men. Indeed, every one of these wait for<br>opportunity in respect of men, like a hunter expectant of opportunities<br>in respect of deer. Assertion of one's own superiority, desire of<br>enjoying others' wives, humiliating others from excess of pride,<br>wrathfulness, fickleness, and refusing to maintain those worthy of being<br>maintained, these six acts of wickedness are always practised by sinful<br>men defying all dangers here and hereafter. He that regards the<br>gratification of lust to be one of life's aims, he that is exceedingly<br>proud, he that grieves having given away, he that never spends money, he<br>that persecutes his subjects by exacting hateful taxes, he that delights<br>in the humiliation of others, and he that hates his own wives,&#8212;these<br>seven are others that are also called wicked. Righteousness, truth<br>(abstention from injury and truthfulness of speech), self-restraint,<br>asceticism, delight in the happiness of others, modesty, forbearance,<br>love of others, sacrifices, gifts, perseverance, knowledge of the<br>scriptures,&#8212;these twelve constitute the practices of Brahmanas. He that<br>succeeds in acquiring these twelve, becomes competent to sway the entire<br>earth. He that is endued with three, two, or even one, of these, should<br>be regarded of heavenly prosperity. Self-restraint, renunciation, and<br>knowledge of Self,&#8212;in these are emancipation. Those Brahmanas that are<br>endued with wisdom, say, that these are attributes in which truth<br>predominates. Self-restraint is constituted by eighteen virtues. Breaches<br>and non-observance of ordained acts and omissions, falsehood, malice,<br>lust, wealth, love of (sensual) pleasure, anger, grief, thirst, avarice,<br>deceit, joy in the misery of others, envy, injuring others, regret,<br>aversion from pious acts, forgetfulness of duty, calumniating others, and<br>vanity-he that is freed from these (eighteen) vices; is said by the<br>righteous to be self-restrained. The eighteen faults (that have been<br>enumerated) constitute what is called mada or pride. Renunciation is of<br>six kinds. The reverse of those six again are faults called mada. (The<br>faults, therefore, that go by the name of mada are eighteen and six). The<br>six kinds of renunciation are all commendable. The third only is<br>difficult of practice, but by that all sorrow is overcome. Indeed, if<br>that kind of renunciation be accomplished in practice, he that<br>accomplishes it overcomes all the pairs of contraries in the world.<br><br>'The six kinds of renunciation are all commendable. They are these: The<br>first is never experiencing joy on occasions of prosperity. The second is<br>the abandonment of sacrifices, prayers, and pious acts. That which is<br>called the third, O king, is the abandonment of desire or withdrawing<br>from the world. Indeed, it is in consequence of this third kind of<br>renunciation of desire, which is evidenced by the abandonment of all<br>objects of enjoyment (without enjoying them) and not their abandonment<br>after having enjoyed them to the fill, nor by abandonment after<br>acquisition, nor by abandonment only after one has become incompetent to<br>enjoy from loss of appetite. The fourth kind of renunciation consists in<br>this: One should not grieve nor suffer his self to be afflicted by grief<br>when one's actions fail, notwithstanding one's possession of all the<br>virtues and all kinds of wealth. Or, when anything disagreeable happens,<br>one feeleth no pain. The fifth kind of renunciation consists in not<br>soliciting even one's sons, wives, and others that may all be very dear.<br>The sixth kind consists in giving away to a deserving person who<br>solicits, which act of gifts is always productive of merit. By these<br>again, one acquires the knowledge of Self. As regards this last<br>attribute, it involves eight qualities. These are truth, meditation,<br>distinction of subject and object, capacity for drawing inferences,<br>withdrawal from the world, never taking what belongeth to others, the<br>practices of Brahmacharya vows (abstinence), and non-acceptance (of<br>gifts).<br><br>'So also the attribute of mada (the opposite of dama or self-restraint)<br>hath faults which have all been indicated (in the scriptures). These<br>faults should be avoided. I have spoken (to thee) of renunciation and<br>self-knowledge. And as, self-Knowledge hath eight virtues, so the want of<br>it hath eight faults. Those faults should be avoided. O Bharata, he that<br>is liberated from this five senses, mind, the past and the future,<br>becomes happy. O king, let thy soul be devoted to truth; all the worlds<br>are established on truth; indeed, self-control, renunciation, and<br>self-knowledge are said to have truth for their foremost attribute.<br>Avoiding (these) faults, one should practise asceticism here. The<br>Ordainer hath ordained that truth alone should be the vow of the<br>righteous. Asceticism, that is dissociated from these faults and endued<br>with these virtues, becomes the source of great prosperity, I have now<br>briefly told these about that sin-destroying and sacred subject which<br>thou hadst asked me and which is capable of liberating a person from<br>birth, death, and decrepitude.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'With Akhyana (Puranas) as their fifth, the Vedas<br>declare the Supreme Soul to be this universe consisting of mobile and<br>immobile things. Others regard four God-heads; and others three; others<br>again regard two; and others only one; and others regard Brahman alone as<br>the sole existent object (there being nothing else possessing a separate<br>existence). Amongst these, which should I know to be really possessed of<br>the knowledge of Brahman.'<br><br>"Sanat-sujata, 'There is but one Brahman which is Truth's self. It is<br>from ignorance of that One, that god-heads have been conceived to be<br>diverse. But who is there, O king, that hath attained to Truth's self or<br>Brahman? Man regardeth himself wise without knowing that One Object of<br>knowledge, and from desire of happiness is engaged in study and the<br>practices of charity and sacrifices. They have deviated from Truth<br>(Brahman) and entertain purposes corresponding (with their state) and<br>hence relying on the truth of Vedic texts thereof perform sacrifices.<br>Some perform (or attain the object of) sacrifices by the mind<br>(meditation), some by words (recitation of particular prayers, or Yapa);<br>and some by acts (actual consummation of the Yatishtoma and other costly<br>rites). The person, however, who seeketh Brahman through Truth, obtaineth<br>his desired objects at home. When however, one's purposes become abortive<br>(through absence of knowledge of Self), one should adopt vows of silence<br>and such like, called Dikshavrata. Indeed, Diksha cometh from the root<br>Diksha, meaning the observance of vows. As regards those that have<br>knowledge of Self, with them Truth is the highest object of pursuit.'<br><br>'The fruits of knowledge are visible; asceticism yieldeth fruits<br>hereafter. A Brahmana who (without knowledge and asceticism) hath only<br>read much should only be known as a great reader. Therefore, O Kshatriya,<br>never think that one can be a Brahman (Brahman-knowing) by only reading<br>the scriptures. He, on the other hand, should be known by thee to be<br>possessed of the knowledge of the Brahman who doth not deviate from<br>Truth. O Kshatriya, the verses that were recited by Atharvan to a<br>conclave of great sages, in days of old, are known by the name of<br>Chhandas. They are not be regarded as acquainted with the Chhandas who<br>have only read through the Vedas, without having attained to the<br>knowledge of Him who is known through the Vedas. The Chhandas, O best of<br>men, become the means of obtaining Brahman independently and without the<br>necessity of anything foreign. They cannot be regarded as acquainted with<br>the Chhandas who are acquainted only with the modes of sacrifice enjoined<br>in the Vedas. On the other hand, having waited upon those that are<br>acquainted with the Vedas, have not the righteous attained to the Object<br>that is knowable by the Vedas? There is none who hath truly caught the<br>sense of the Vedas or there may be some who have, O king, caught the<br>sense. He that hath only read the Vedas, doth not know the Object<br>knowable by them. He, however, that is established in Truth, know the<br>Object knowable by the Vedas. Amongst those faculties which lead to<br>perception of the body as the acting agent, there is none by which true<br>knowledge may be acquired. By the mind alone one cannot acquire the<br>knowledge of Self and Not-Self. Indeed, he that knoweth Self also knoweth<br>what is Not-self. He, on the other hand, that knoweth only what is<br>Not-self, doth not know Truth. He, again, that knoweth the proofs,<br>knoweth also that which is sought to be proved. But what that Object in<br>its nature is (which is sought to be proved) is not known to either the<br>Vedas or those that are acquainted with the Vedas. For all that, however,<br>those Brahmanas that are (truly) acquainted with the Vedas succeed in<br>obtaining a knowledge of the Object knowable (by the Vedas) through the<br>Vedas. As the branch of a particular tree is sometimes resorted to for<br>pointing out the lunar digit of the first day of the lighted fortnight so<br>the Vedas are used for indicating the highest attributes of the Supreme<br>Soul. I know him to be a Brahmana (possessing a knowledge of Brahman) who<br>expoundeth the doubts of others, having himself mastered all his own<br>doubts, and who is possessed of the knowledge of Self. One cannot find<br>what the Soul is by seeking in the East, the South, the West, the North,<br>or in the subsidiary directions or horizontally. Very rarely can it be<br>found in him who regardeth this body be to Self. Beyond the conception of<br>even the Vedas, the man of Yoga-meditation only can behold the Supreme.<br>Completely restraining all thy senses and thy mind also seek thou that<br>Brahman which is known to reside in thy own Soul. He is not a Muni who<br>practiseth only Yoga-meditation; nor he who liveth only in the woods<br>(having retired from the world). He, however, is a Muni and is superior<br>to all who knoweth his own nature. In consequence of one's being able to<br>expound every object (Vyakarana), one is said to be endued with universal<br>knowledge (Vaiyakarana); and, indeed, the science itself is called<br>Vyakarana owing to its being able to expound every object to its very<br>root (which is Brahman). The man who beholdeth all the regions as present<br>before his eyes, is said to be possessed of universal knowledge. He that<br>stayeth in Truth and knoweth Brahman is said to be a Brahmana, and a<br>Brahmana, possesseth universal knowledge. A Kshatriya also, that<br>practises such virtues, may behold Brahman. He may also attain to that<br>high state by ascending step by step, according to what is indicated in<br>the Vedas. Knowing it for certain, I tell thee this.'"
