                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing these words of Krishna, king Dhritarashtra<br>lost no time in addressing Vidura, who was conversant with all dictates<br>of virtue. And the king said, 'Go, O child, unto Gandhari, possessed of<br>great wisdom and foresight and bring her hither. With her I will solicit<br>this wicked-hearted (son of mine). If she can pacify this wicked wretch,<br>of evil heart, we may yet be able to act according to the words of our<br>friend Krishna. It may be that speaking words in recommendation of peace,<br>she may yet succeed in pointing out the right path to this fool,<br>afflicted by avarice and having wicked allies, If she can dispel this<br>great and dreadful calamity (about to be) occasioned by Duryodhana, it<br>will then conduce to the attainment and preservation of happiness and<br>peace for ever and ever.' Hearing these words of the king, Vidura, at<br>Dhritarashtra's command, brought (thither) Gandhari, possessed of great<br>foresight. And Dhritarashtra then addressed Gandhari and said, 'Behold, O<br>Gandhari, this thy son of wicked soul, transgressing all my commands, is<br>about to sacrifice both sovereignty and life in consequence of his lust<br>for sovereignty. Of wicked soul and little understanding, he hath, like<br>one of uncultivated mind, left the court, with his sinful counsellors,<br>disregarding his superiors and setting at naught the words of his<br>well-wishers.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing these words of her husband, that princess of<br>great fame, Gandhari, desirous of what was highly beneficial, said these<br>words, 'Bring hither, without loss of time, that kingdom-coveting, sick<br>son of mine. He that is of uncultivated heart and sacrificeth both virtue<br>and profit, doth not deserve to govern a kingdom. For all that, however,<br>Duryodhana, who is destitute of humility hath, by every means, obtained a<br>kingdom. Indeed, O Dhritarashtra, thou so fond of thy son, art very much<br>to be blamed for this, for knowing well his sinfulness, thou followest<br>yet his counsel. That son of thine, completely possessed by lust and<br>wrath is now the slave of delusion, and is, therefore, incapable, O king,<br>of being now forcibly turned back by thee. Thou art now reaping the<br>fruit, O Dhritarashtra, of having made over the kingdom to an ignorant<br>fool of wicked soul, possessed by avarice and having wicked counsellors.<br>Why is the king indifferent (today) to that disunion, which is about to<br>take place between persons related so closely? Indeed, beholding thee<br>disunited with those that are thy own, thy enemies will laugh at thee.<br>Who is there that would use force for getting over that calamity, O king,<br>which can be overcome by conciliation and gift?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Kshattri then, and at Dhritarashtra's command,<br>and of his mother's also, once more caused vindictive Duryodhana to enter<br>the court. Expectant of his mother's words, the prince re-entered the<br>court, with eyes red as copper from wrath, and breathing heavily as a<br>snake. And beholding her son, who was treading in a wrong path, enter the<br>court, Gandhari rebuked him severely and said these words for bringing<br>about peace.'<br><br>"Gandhari said, 'O Duryodhana, attend, O dear son, to these words of mine<br>that are beneficial to thee as also to all thy followers,&#8212;words that<br>thou art competent to obey and that will conduce to thy happiness. O<br>Duryodhana, obey thou the words of thy well-wishers, those words, viz.,<br>which that best of the Bharatas&#8212;thy father&#8212;and Bhishma, and Drona, and<br>Kripa, and Kshattri, have spoken. If thou makest peace, thou wouldst by<br>that render homage to Bhishma, to thy father, to me, and to all thy<br>well-wishers with Drona at their head. O thou of great wisdom, nobody, O<br>best of the Bharatas, succeedeth by his own desire alone in acquiring and<br>keeping or enjoying a kingdom. One that hath not his senses under<br>control, cannot enjoy sovereignty for any length of time. He that hath<br>his soul under control and is endued with great intelligence, can rule a<br>kingdom. Lust and wrath wean away a man from his possessions and<br>enjoyments. Conquering these foes first, a king bringeth the earth under<br>his subjection. Sovereignty over men is a great thing. Those that are of<br>wicked souls may easily desire to win a kingdom, but they are not<br>competent to retain a kingdom (when won). He that desireth to obtain<br>extensive empire must bind his senses to both profit and virtue, for if<br>the senses are restrained, intelligence increaseth, like fire that<br>increaseth when fed with fuel. If not controlled, these can even slay<br>their possessor, like unbroken and furious horses, capable of killing an<br>unskilful driver. One that seeketh to conquer his counsellors without<br>conquering his own self, and to conquer foes without conquering his<br>counsellors, is soon vanquished himself and is ruined. He who conquereth<br>his own self first, taking it for a foe, will not seek in vain to conquer<br>his counsellors and enemies afterwards. Prosperity worshippeth greatly<br>that person who hath conquered his senses and his counsellors, who<br>inflicteth punishments on transgressors, who acteth after deliberation,<br>and who is possessed of wisdom. Lust and wrath that dwell in the body are<br>deprived of their strength by wisdom, like a couple of fishes ensnared in<br>a net with close holes. Those two in consequence of which the gods shut<br>the gates of heaven against one, who freed from worldly propensities is<br>desirous of going thither, are excited by lust and wrath. That king who<br>knoweth well how to conquer lust and wrath and avarice and boastfulness<br>and pride, can own the sovereignty of the whole earth. That king who is<br>desirous of gaining wealth and virtue and vanquishing his enemies, should<br>always be engaged in controlling his passions. Influenced by lust, or<br>from wrath, he that behaveth deceitfully towards his own kinsmen or<br>others, can never win many allies. Uniting thyself with those chastisers<br>of foes&#8212;the heroic sons of Pandu&#8212;who are all endued with great wisdom,<br>thou canst, O son, enjoy the earth in happiness. What Bhishma, the son of<br>Santanu, and that mighty car-warrior, Drona, have told thee is, O son,<br>quite true,&#8212;Krishna and Dhananjaya are invincible. Seek thou, therefore,<br>the protection of this mighty-armed one, this one that is not worried by<br>exertion, for if Kesava becometh gracious, both sides will be happy. That<br>min, who is not obedient to the wishes of wise and learned friends,<br>always seeking his prosperity, only gladdeneth his enemies. O son, there<br>is no good in battle, no virtue, no profit. How can it bring happiness<br>then? Even victory is not always certain. Do not set thy heart,<br>therefore, on battle. O thou of great wisdom, Bhishma and thy father and<br>Vahlika (formerly) gave unto the Pandavas their share (of the kingdom)<br>from fear. O chastiser of foes, never think of disunion with them. Thou<br>beholdest today the fruit of that (peaceful) cession in the fact of thy<br>sovereignty over the whole earth, with all its thorns removed by those<br>heroes. Give, O chastiser of foes, unto the son of Pandu what is their<br>due. If thou wishest to enjoy, with the counsellors even half (the<br>empire), let their share then be given unto them. Half the earth is<br>sufficient to yield the means of support unto thee and thy counsellors.<br>By acting according to the words of thy well-wishers, thou wilt, O<br>Bharata, win great fame. A quarrel with the sons of Pandu who are all<br>endued with prosperity, who have their souls under complete control, who<br>are possessed of great intelligence and have conquered their passions,<br>will only divest thee of thy great prosperity. Dispelling the wrath of<br>all thy well-wishers, rule thou thy kingdom as becometh thee, giving, O<br>bull of Bharata's race, unto the sons of Pandu the share that belongeth<br>to them. O son, persecution of the sons of Pandu for full thirteen years<br>hath been enough. Augmented by lust and wrath, quench (that fire) now, O<br>thou of great wisdom. Thou that covetest the wealth of the Pandavas are<br>not a match for them, nor this Suta's son, who is exceedingly wrathful,<br>nor this thy brother Dussasana. Indeed, when Bhishma and Drona and Kripa<br>and Karna and Bhimasena and Dhananjaya and Dhrishtadyumna will be<br>enraged, the population of the earth will be exterminated. Under the<br>influence of wrath, do not, O son, exterminate the Kurus. Let not the<br>wide earth be destroyed for thy sake. Of little understanding as thou<br>art, thou thinkest that Bhishma, and Drona, and Kripa, all others will<br>fight (for thee) with all their might. That will never happen, for as<br>regards these, that are endued with self-knowledge, their affection<br>towards the Pandavas and yourselves is equal. If for the sake of the<br>sustenance they have obtained from the king (Dhritarashtra), they consent<br>to yield up their very lives, they will not yet be able to cast angry<br>glances upon king Yudhishthira. It is never seen in this world that men<br>acquire wealth by avarice. Give up thy avarice then, O son, and desist, O<br>bull of Bharat's race.'"
