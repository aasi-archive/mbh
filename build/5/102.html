                            "Narada said, 'The region where we now are is called Rasatala and is the<br>seventh stratum below the Earth. Here dwelleth Surabhi, the mother of all<br>kine, she, who was born of the Amrita. She always yieldeth milk which is<br>the essence of all the best things of the earth, and which, excellent as<br>it is, and of one taste, springeth from the essence of the six different<br>kinds of tastes (that are talked of). The faultless Surabhi herself<br>sprang in days of old from the mouth of the Grandsire, gratified with<br>drinking the Amrita and vomiting the best things. A single jet only of<br>her milk, falling on the earth, created what is known as the sacred and<br>the excellent "Milky Ocean." The verge of that ocean all round is always<br>covered with white foam resembling a belt of flowers. Those best of<br>ascetics that are known by the name of the Foam-drinkers dwell around<br>this ocean, subsisting on that foam only. They are called Foam-drinkers<br>because they live, O Matali, on nothing else save that foam. Engaged in<br>the practice of the severest of austerities, the very gods are known to<br>fear them. From her are born four other kine, O Matali, supporting the<br>four quarters and therefore, are they called the supporters of the<br>quarters (Dikpali). Born of Surabhi herself, she who supporteth the<br>eastern quarter is called Surupa. She, who supporteth the southern<br>quarter is called Hansika. That illustrious cow, O Matali, of universal<br>form, who supporteth the western quarter ruled by Varuna is known by the<br>name of Subhadra. The northern quarter comprising the region of virtue,<br>and called after Kuvera the Lord of treasures, is supported by the cow<br>named Sarva-kamadugha. The gods, uniting with the Asuras, and making the<br>Mandara mountain their pole, churned the waters of the ocean and obtained<br>the wine called Varuni, and (the Goddess of Prosperity and Grace called)<br>Lakshmi, and Amrita, and that prince of steeds called Uchchhaisrava, and<br>that best of gems called Kaustubha. Those waters, O Matali, that yielded<br>these precious things had all been mixed with the milk of these tour<br>cows. As regards Surabhi, the milk she yielded becometh Swaha unto those<br>that live on Swaha, Swadha unto those that live on Swadha, and Amrita<br>unto those that live on Amrita. The couplet that was sung by the dwellers<br>of Rasatala in day of old, is still heard to be recited in the world by<br>the persons of learning. That couplet is this,&#8212;Neither in the region of<br>the Nagas, nor in Swarga, nor in Vimana, nor in Tripishtapa is residence<br>so happy as in Rasatala!'"
