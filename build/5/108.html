                            "Garuda said, 'O Galava, commanded I have been by God, who is the cause<br>of all knowledge. I ask thee, towards which quarter shall I first take<br>thee to see what lie there? The eastern, the southern, the western, or<br>the northern, towards which, O best of regenerate persons, shall I go, O<br>Galava? That quarter towards which Surya the illuminator of the universe<br>first riseth; where, at eve, the Sadhyas engage in their ascetic<br>austerities; where that Intelligence, which pervades the whole universe<br>first springeth; where the two eyes of Dharma, as well as he himself, are<br>stationed; where the clarified butter first poured in sacrifice<br>subsequently flowed all around; that quarter, O best of all regenerate<br>persons, is the gate of Day and Time. There the daughters of Daksha, in<br>primeval times, gave birth to their children. There the sons of Kasyapa<br>first multiplied. That quarter is the source of all the prosperity of the<br>gods, for it was there that Sakra was first anointed as the king of the<br>celestials. It was there, O regenerate Rishi, that both Indra and the<br>gods underwent their ascetic penances. It is for this, O Brahmana, that<br>this quarter is called Purva (the first). And because in the earliest of<br>times this quarter was overspread by the Suras, it is for this that it is<br>called Purva. The gods, desirous of prosperity, performed all their<br>religious ceremonies here. It was here that the divine Creator of the<br>universe first sang the Vedas. It was here that the Gayatri was first<br>preached by Surya unto the reciters of that sacred hymn. It was here, O<br>best of Brahmanas, that the Yajurvedas  were delivered by Surya (unto<br>Yajnavalkya). It was here that the Soma juice, sanctified by boons, was<br>first drunk in sacrifices by Suras. It was here that the Homa-fires,<br>(gratified by mantras), first drank articles of cognate origin.[13] It<br>was here that Varuna first repaired to the nether regions, and attained<br>to all his prosperity. It was here, O bull among the twice-born, that the<br>birth, growth, and death of the ancient Vasishtha took place. Here first<br>grew the hundred different branches of Om![14] It was here that the<br>smoke-eating Munis are the smoke of sacrificial fires. It was in that<br>region that myriads of boars and other animals were killed by Sakra and<br>offered as sacrificial portions unto the gods. It is here that the<br>thousand-rayed sun, arising, consumeth, out of ire, all those that are<br>wicked and ungrateful among men and the Asuras. This is the gate of the<br>three worlds. This is the path of heaven and felicity. This quarter is<br>called Purva (east). We will go hither, if it pleaseth thee. I shall<br>always do what is agreeable to him who is my friend. Tell me, O Galava,<br>if any other quarter pleaseth thee, for we will then go there. Listen now<br>to what I say of another quarter.'"
