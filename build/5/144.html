                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Upon the failure of Krishna's solicitations (for<br>peace), and after he had started for the Pandavas from the Kurus, Kshatri<br>approached Pritha and said these words slowly in grief, 'O mother of<br>living children, thou knowest that my inclination is always for peace,<br>and although I cry myself hoarse, yet Suyodhana doth not accept my words.<br>King Yudhishthira, having the Chedis, the Panchalas, and the Kekayas,<br>Bhima and Arjuna, Krishna, Yuyudhana, and the twins for his allies,<br>stayeth yet at Upaplavya, and from affection for kinsmen, looketh up to<br>righteousness only, like a weak man, though he is possessed of great<br>strength. King Dhritarashtra here, though old in years, doth not effect<br>peace, and intoxicated with pride of children, treadeth a sinful path. In<br>consequence of the wickedness of Jayadratha and Karna and Dussasana and<br>Suvala's son, intestine dissensions will break out. They that behave<br>unrighteously towards him that is righteous, verily that sin of theirs<br>soon produceth its consequences. Who is there that will not be filled<br>with sorrow at the sight of the Kurus persecuting righteousness in this<br>way? When Kesava returneth without being able to bring about peace, the<br>Pandavas will certainly address themselves for battle. Thereupon, the sin<br>of the Kurus will lead to a destruction of heroes. Reflecting on all<br>this, I do not get sleep by day or by night.'<br><br>"Hearing these words uttered by Vidura, who always wished her sons the<br>accomplishment of their objects, Kunti began to sigh heavily, afflicted<br>with grief, and began to think within herself, 'Fie to wealth, for the<br>sake of which this great slaughter of kinsmen is about to take place.<br>Indeed, in this war, they that are friends will sustain defeat. What can<br>be a greater grief than this that the Pandavas, the Chedis, the<br>Panchalas, and the Yadavas, assembled together, will fight with the<br>Bharatas? Verily, I behold demerit in war. (On the other hand) if we do<br>not fight, poverty and humiliation would be ours. As regards the person<br>that is poor, even death is beneficial (to him). (On the other band) the<br>extermination of one's kinsmen is not victory. As I reflect on this, my<br>heart swelleth with sorrow. The grandsire (Bhishma), the son of Santanu,<br>the preceptor (Drona), who is the foremost of warriors, and Karna, having<br>embraced Duryodhana's side, enhance my fears. The preceptor Drona, it<br>seemeth to me, will never fight willingly against his pupils. As regards<br>the Grandsire, why will he not show some affection for the Pandavas?<br>There is only this sinful Karna then, of deluded understanding and ever<br>following the deluded lead of the wicked Duryodhana, that hateth the<br>Pandavas. Obstinately pursuing that which injureth the Pandavas, this<br>Karna is, again, very powerful. It is this which burneth me at present.<br>Proceeding to gratify him. I will today disclose the truth and seek to<br>draw his heart towards the Pandavas. Pleased with me, while I was living<br>in the inner apartments of the palace of my father, Kuntibhoja, the holy<br>Durvasa gave me a boon in the form of an invocation consisting of<br>mantras. Long reflecting with a trembling heart on the strength or<br>weakness of those mantras and the power also of the Brahmana's words, and<br>in consequence also of my disposition as a woman, and my nature as a girl<br>of unripe years, deliberating repeatedly and while guarded by a<br>confidential nurse and surrounded by my waiting-maids, and thinking also<br>of how not to incur any reproach, how to maintain the honour of my<br>father, and how I myself might have an accession of good fortune without<br>being guilty of any transgression, I, at last, remembered that Brahmana<br>and bowed to him, and having obtained that mantras from excess of<br>curiosity and from folly, I summoned, during my maidenhood, the god<br>Surya. He, therefore, who was held in my womb during my maidenhood,&#8212;why<br>should he not obey my words that are certainly acceptable and beneficial<br>to his brothers? And reflecting in this strain, Kunti formed an excellent<br>resolution. And having formed that resolution, she went to the sacred<br>stream called after Bhagiratha. And having reached the banks of Ganga,<br>Pritha heard the chanting of the Vedic hymns by her son, endued with<br>great kindness and firmly devoted to truth. And as Karna stood with face<br>directed to the east and arms upraised, then helpless Kunti, for the sake<br>of her interest stayed behind him, waiting the completion of prayers. And<br>the lady of Vrishni's race, that wife of Kuru's house, afflicted by the<br>heat of the sun began to look like a faded garland of lotuses. And, at<br>last, she stood in the shade afforded by the upper garments of Karna. And<br>Karna, of regulated vows, said his prayers until his back became heated<br>by the rays of the sun. Then turning behind, he behold Kunti and was<br>filled with surprise. And saluting him in proper form and with joined<br>palms that foremost of virtuous persons, endued with great energy and<br>pride, viz., Vrisha, the son of Vikartana, bowed to her and said (the<br>following words)."'
