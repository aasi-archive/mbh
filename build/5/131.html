                            "Vaisampayana said, 'After Vidura had said this, Kesava, that slayer of<br>hostile divisions, endued with great energy, addressed Dhritarashtra's<br>son, Duryodhana, and said, 'From delusion, O Suyodhana, thou regardest me<br>to be alone, and it is for this, O thou of little understanding, that<br>thou seekest to make me a captive after vanquishing me by violence. Here,<br>however, are all the Pandavas and all the Vrishnis and Andhakas. Here are<br>all the Adityas, the Rudras, and the Vasus, with all the great Rishis.<br>Saying this Kesava, that slayer of hostile heroes burst out into a loud<br>laughter. And as the high-souled Sauri laughed, from his body, that<br>resembled a blazing fire, issued myriads of gods, each of lightning<br>effulgence, and not bigger than the thumb. And on his forehead appeared<br>Brahman, and on his breast Rudra. And on his arms appeared the regents of<br>the world, and from his mouth issued Agni, the Adityas, the Sadhyas, the<br>Vasus, the Aswins, the Marutas, with Indra, and the Viswedevas. And<br>myriads of Yakshas, and the Gandharvas, and Rakshasas also, of the same<br>measure and form, issued thence. And from his two arms issued Sankarshana<br>and Dhananjaya. And Arjuna stood on his right, bow in hand, and Rama<br>stood on his left, armed with the plough. And behind him stood Bhima, and<br>Yudhishthira, and the two sons of Madri, and before him were all the<br>Andhakas and the Vrishnis with Pradyumna and other chiefs bearing mighty<br>weapons upraised. And on his diverse arms were seen the conch, the<br>discus, the mace, the bow called Saranga, the plough, the javelin, the<br>Nandaka, and every other weapon, all shining with effulgence, and<br>upraised for striking. And from his eyes and nose and ears and every part<br>of his body, issued fierce sparks of fire mixed with smoke. And from the<br>pores of his body issued sparks of fire like unto the rays of the sun.<br>And beholding that awful form of the high-souled Kesava, all the kings<br>closed their eyes with affrighted hearts, except Drona, and Bhishma, and<br>Vidura, endued with great intelligence, greatly blessed Sanjaya, and the<br>Rishis, possessed of wealth of asceticism, for the divine Janardana gave<br>unto them this divine sight on the occasion. And beholding in the (Kuru)<br>court that highly wonderful sight, celestial drums beat (in the sky) and<br>a floral shower fell (upon him). And the whole Earth trembled (at the<br>time) and the oceans were agitated. And, O bull of the Bharata's race,<br>all the denizens of the earth were filled with great wonder. Then that<br>tiger among men, that chastiser of foes, withdrew that divine and highly<br>wonderful, and extremely varied and auspicious form. And arm-in-arm with<br>Satyaki on one side and Hridika's son (Kritavarman) on the other, and<br>obtaining permission of the Rishis, the slayer of Madhu went out. And<br>during the uproar that then took place, the Rishis, Narada and others<br>vanquished, for repairing to their respective places. And this also was<br>another wonderful incident that happened. And seeing that tiger among men<br>leave the court, the Kauravas with all the kings followed him, like the<br>gods following Indra. Sauri, however, of immeasurable soul, without<br>bestowing a single thought on those that followed him, issued from the<br>court, like a blazing fire mixed with smoke. And he beheld (at the gate<br>his charioteer) Daruka waiting with his large white car, furnished with<br>rows of tinkling bells, decked with golden ornaments, and endued with<br>great speed, the clatter of whose wheels resounded like the rumbling of<br>the clouds, and which was covered all over with white tiger-skins, and<br>unto which were harnessed his steeds Saivya (and others). And there also<br>appeared, mounted on his car, that favourite hero of Vrishnis, the mighty<br>car-warrior Kritavarman, the son of Hridika. And that chastiser of foes,<br>Sauri, who had his car ready, was about to depart, king Dhritarashtra<br>addressed him once more and said, 'O grinder of foes, thou hast seen, O<br>Janardana, the power I wield over my sons! Thou hast, indeed, witnessed<br>all with thy own eyes. Nothing now is unknown to thee. Seeing me<br>endeavour to bring about peace between the Kurus, and the Pandavas, in<br>fact, knowing the state (in which I am), it behoveth thee not to<br>entertain any suspicion regarding me. O Kesava, I have no sinful feelings<br>towards the Pandavas. Thou knowest what words have been spoken by me to<br>Suyodhana. The Kauravas and all the kings of the Earth, also know, O<br>Madhava, that I have made every endeavour to bring about peace.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The mighty-armed Janardana then addressed<br>Dhritarashtra, Drona, grandsire Bhishma, Kshattri, Vahlika, and Kripa and<br>said, 'Ye have yourselves witnessed all that hath happened in the<br>assembly of the Kurus, viz., how wicked Duryodhana, like an uneducated<br>wretch, left the court from anger, and how king Dhritarashtra also<br>describeth himself to be powerless. With the permission of you all, I<br>shall now go back to Yudhishthira.' Saluting them, that bull amongst men,<br>Sauri then mounted his car and set out. And those heroic bulls amongst<br>the Bharatas, those mighty bowmen, viz., Bhishma, Drona, and Kripa, and<br>Kshattri, and Aswatthaman and Vikarna, and that mighty car-warrior<br>Yuyutsu, all began to follow him. And Kesava, on his large white car,<br>furnished with rows of tinkling bells, proceeded then, in the very sight<br>of the Kurus, to the abode of his paternal aunt (Kunti).'"
