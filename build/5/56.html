                            "Duryodhana said, 'Having obtained, O Sanjaya, an army numbering seven<br>Akshauhinis, what is Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, with the other kings<br>in his company, doing in view of the war?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Yudhishthira, O king, is very cheerful in view of the<br>battle. And so also are Bhimasena and Arjuna. The twins also are<br>perfectly fearless. Desirous of making an experiment of the mantras<br>(obtained by him). Vibhatsu, the son of Kunti, yoked his celestial car<br>illuminating all the directions. Accoutred in mail, he looked like a mass<br>of clouds charged with lightning. After reflecting for a while, he<br>cheerfully addressed me, saying,&#8212;Behold, O Sanjaya, these preliminary<br>signs. We will certainly conquer.' Indeed, what Vibhatsu said unto me<br>appeared to me to be true.'<br><br>"Duryodhana said, 'Thou rejoicest to applaud those sons of Pritha<br>defeated at dice. Tell us now what sort of steeds are yoked unto Arjuna's<br>car and what sort of banners are set up on it?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'O great king, the celestial artificer called Tashtri or<br>Bhaumana, aided by Sakra and Dhatri, created forms of diverse kinds and<br>great beauty for Arjuna's car. And displaying divine illusion they placed<br>on his flagstaff those celestial forms, large and small, of great value.<br>And at Bhimasena's request, Hanumat, the son of the Wind-god, will also<br>place his own image on it. And Bhaumana has, in its creation, had<br>recourse to such illusion that that banner covers, both perpendicularly<br>and laterally, an area of one yojana, and even if trees stand in its way,<br>its course cannot be impeded. Indeed, even as Sakra's bow of diverse<br>colours is exhibited in the firmament, and nobody knows of what it is<br>made, so hath that banner been contrived by Bhaumana, for its form is<br>varied and ever varying. And as column of smoke mixed with fire riseth<br>up, covering the sky and displaying many bright hues and elegant shapes,<br>so doth that banner contrived by Bhaumana rear its head. Indeed, it hath<br>no weight, nor is it capable of being obstructed. And unto that car are a<br>century of excellent celestial steeds of white hue and endued with the<br>speed of the mind, all presented by Chitrasena (the king of the<br>Gandharvas). And neither on earth, O king, nor in the sky, nor in heaven,<br>their course can be impeded. And formerly a boon hath been granted to the<br>effect that their number would always remain full how often so ever they<br>might be slain. And unto Yudhishthira's car are yoked large steeds of<br>equal energy and white in colour like ivory. And unto Bhimasena's car are<br>yoked courses endued with the speed of the wind and the splendour of the<br>seven Rishis. And steeds of sable bodies and backs variegated like the<br>wings of the Tittri bird, all presented by his gratified brother Falguna,<br>and superior to those of the heroic Falguna himself, cheerfully carry<br>Sahadeva. And Nakula of Ajamida's race, the son of Madri, is borne, like<br>Indra the slayer of Vritra, by excellent steeds, presented by the great<br>Indra himself, all mighty as the wind and endued with great speed. And<br>excellent steed of large size, equal unto those of the Pandavas<br>themselves in years and strength, endued with great swiftness and of<br>handsome make, and all presented by the celestials, carry those youthful<br>princes, the sons of Subhadra and Draupadi.'"
