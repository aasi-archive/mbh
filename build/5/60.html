                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Having heard these words of Sanjaya, the monarch<br>endued with the eye of wisdom, took that speech into his consideration as<br>regards its merits and demerits. And having counted in detail the merits<br>and demerits as far as he could, and having exactly ascertained the<br>strength and weakness of both parties, the learned and intelligent king,<br>ever desirous of victory to his sons, then began to compare the powers of<br>both sides. And having at last ascertained that the Pandavas were endued<br>with strength and energy both human and divine, and that the Kurus were<br>much weaker Dhritarashtra said unto Duryodhana, 'This anxiety, O<br>Duryodhana, always filleth me. Indeed, it doth not leave me. Truly, it<br>seemeth that I behold it with my eye. This conviction is not a matter of<br>inference. All created beings show great affection for their offsprings,<br>and do, to the best of their power, what is agreeable and beneficial to<br>them. This is generally to be seen also in the case of benefactors. They<br>that are good always desire to return the good done to them and to do<br>what is highly agreeable to their benefactors. Remembering what was done<br>to him to Khandava, Agni will, no doubt, reader aid to Arjuna in this<br>terrible encounter between the Kurus and the Pandavas. And from parental<br>affection, Dharma. and other celestials duly invoked, will come together<br>to the aid of the Pandavas. I think that to save them from Bhishma and<br>Drona and Kripa, the celestials will be filled with wrath, resembling the<br>thunderbolt in its effects. Endued with energy and well-versed in the use<br>of weapons, those tigers among men, the sons of Pritha, when united with<br>the celestials, will be incapable of being even gazed upon by human<br>warriors, He who hath the irresistible, excellent and celestial Gandiva<br>for his bow, he who hath a couple of celestial quivers obtained from<br>Varuna,&#8212;large, full of shafts, and inexhaustible, he on whose banner,<br>that is unobstructed like smoke in its action, is stationed the<br>monkey-image of celestial origin, whose car is unequalled on the earth<br>girt by the four seas, and the rattle of which as heard by men is like<br>the roar of the clouds, and which like the rolling of the thunder<br>frightens the foe; he whom the whole world regards as superhuman in<br>energy; he whom all the kings of the earth know to be the vanquisher of<br>the very gods in battle; he that taketh up five hundred arrows at a time<br>and in the twinkling of the eye, shooteth them, unseen by other, to a<br>great distance; that son of Pritha and tiger among car-warriors and<br>chastiser of foes, whom Bhishma and Drona and Kripa and Drona's son and<br>Salya, the king of the Madras, and in fact, all impartial persons, regard<br>as incapable of being vanquished by even earthly kings of superhuman<br>prowess, when ready for fight who shooteth at one stretch full five<br>hundred arrows, and who is equal unto Kartavirya in strength of arms;<br>that great bowman, Arjuna, equal unto Indra or Upendra in prowess,&#8212;I<br>behold that great warrior committing a great havoc in this terrible<br>battle. O Bharata, reflecting day and night on this, I am unhappy and<br>sleepless, through anxiety for the welfare of the Kurus. A terrible<br>destruction is about to overtake the Kurus, if there is nothing but Peace<br>for ending this quarrel. I am for peace with the Parthas and not for war.<br>O child, I always deem the Pandavas mightier than the Kurus.'"
