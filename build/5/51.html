                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'All these named by thee are, indeed, endued with<br>great courage, but all of them together are equal to Bhima singly. My<br>fear, O child, from the wrathful Bhima is, indeed, very great, like that<br>of fat deer from an enraged tiger. I pass all my nights in sleeplessness,<br>breathing deep and hot sighs afraid of Vrikodara, O child, like an animal<br>of any other species afraid of the lion. Of mighty arms, and in energy<br>equal unto Sakra himself, I see not in this whole army even one that can<br>withstand him in battle. Exceedingly wrathful and determined in<br>animosity, that son of Kunti and Pandu smileth not even in jest, is mad<br>with rage, casteth his glances obliquely, and speaketh in a voice of<br>thunder. Of great impetuosity and great courage, of long arms and great<br>might, he will not, in battle, leave even one of my foolish sons alive.<br>Indeed, Vrikodara, that bull among the Kurus, whirling his mace in<br>battle, will, like a second Yama mace in hand slay all my sons who are<br>afflicted by a heavy calamity. Even now I see that terrible mace of his,<br>with eight sides made of steel, and adorned with gold, uplifted like a<br>Brahmana's curse. As a lion of mighty strength among a flock of deer,<br>Bhima will range among my troops. He only (amongst his brothers) always<br>displayed his strength cruelly towards my sons. Eating voraciously, and<br>endued with great impetuosity, from his very childhood he hath been<br>behaving inimically towards my children. My heart trembleth (to remember)<br>that even in their childhood, Duryodhana and other sons of mine, while<br>fighting with him (sportively) were always ground down by the<br>elephant-like Bhima. Alas, my sons have always been oppressed by his<br>might, and it is that Bhima of terrible prowess that hath been the cause<br>of this rupture. Even now I behold Bhima, mad with rage, fighting in the<br>very van, and devouring the whole of my host consisting of men,<br>elephants, and steeds. Equal unto Drona and Arjuna in weapons, his speed<br>equal unto the velocity of the wind, and in wrath like unto Maheswara<br>himself, who is there, O Sanjaya, that would slay that wrathful and<br>terrible hero in battle? I think it to be a great gain that my sons were<br>not even then slain by that slayer of enemies who is endued with such<br>energy. How can a human being withstand the impetuosity of that warrior<br>in battle who slew Yakshas and Rakshasas of terrible might before? O<br>Sanjaya, even in his childhood he was never completely under my control.<br>Injured by my wicked sons, how can that son of Pandu come under my<br>control now? Cruel and extremely wrathful, he would break but not bend.<br>Of oblique glances and contracted eye-brows, how can he be induced to<br>remain quiet? Endued with heroism, of incomparable might and fair<br>complexion, tall like a palmyra tree, and in height taller than Arjuna by<br>the span of the thumb, the second son of Pandu surpasseth the very steeds<br>in swiftness, and elephants in strength, speaketh in indistinct accents,<br>and possesseth eyes having the hue of honey. As regards form and might,<br>even such was he in his very boyhood, as I truly heard long before from<br>the lips of Vyasa! Terrible and possessed of cruel might, when angry he<br>will destroy in battle with his iron-mace cars and elephants and men and<br>horses. By acting against his wishes, that foremost of smiters who is<br>ever wrathful and furious, hath before been, O child, insulted by me.<br>Alas, how will my sons bear that mace of his which is straight, made of<br>steel, thick, of beautiful sides, adorned with gold, capable of slaying a<br>hundred, and producing a terrible sound when hurled at the foe? Alas, O<br>child, my foolish sons are desirous of crossing that inaccessible ocean<br>constituted by Bhima, which is really shoreless, without a raft on it,<br>immeasurable in depth, and full of currents impetuous as the course of<br>arrows. Fools in reality though boasting of their wisdom, alas, my<br>children do not listen to me even though I cry out. Beholding only the<br>honey they do not see the terrible fall that is before them. They that<br>will rush to battle with Death himself in that human shape, are certainly<br>doomed to destruction by the Supreme Ordainer, like animals within the<br>lion's view. Full four cubits in length, endued with six sides and great<br>might, and having also a deadly touch, when he will hurl his mace from'<br>the sting, how shall my sons, O child, bear its impetus? Whirling his<br>mace and breaking therewith the heads of (hostile) elephants, licking<br>with his tongue the corners of his mouth and drawing long breaths, when<br>he will rush with loud roars against mighty elephants, returning the<br>yells of those infuriated beasts that might rush against him, and when<br>entering the close array of cars he will slay, after taking proper aim,<br>the chief warriors before him, what mortal of my party will escape from<br>him looking like a blazing flame? Crushing my forces and cutting a<br>passage through them, that mighty armed hero, dancing with mace in hand,<br>will exhibit the scene, witnessed during the universal Dissolution at the<br>end of a Yuga. Like an infuriated elephant crushing trees adorned with<br>flowers, Vrikodara, in battle will, furiously penetrate the ranks of my<br>sons. Depriving my warriors of their cars, drivers, steeds, and<br>flag-staff, and afflicting all warriors fighting from cars and the backs<br>of elephants, that tiger among men will, O Sanjaya, like the impetuous<br>current of Ganga throwing down diverse trees standing on its banks, crush<br>in battle the troops of my sons. Without doubt, O Sanjaya, afflicted by<br>the fear of Bhimasena, my sons and their dependents and all the allied<br>kings will fly in different directions. It was this Bhima who, having<br>entered of old, with Vasudeva's aid, the innermost apartments of<br>Jarasandha, overthrew that king endued with great energy; that lord of<br>Magadha, the mighty Jarasandha, having fully brought under his subjection<br>the goddess Earth, oppressed her by his energy. That the Kauravas in<br>consequence of Bhishma's prowess, and the Andhakas and the Vrishnis in<br>consequence of their policy, could not be subjugated by him was due only<br>to their good fortune. What could be more wonderful than that the heroic<br>son of Pandu, of mighty arms and without any weapons, having approached<br>that king, slew him in a trice? Like a venomous snake, whose poison hath<br>accumulated for years, Bhima will, O Sanjaya, vomit in battle the poison<br>of his wrath upon my sons! Like the foremost of the celestials, the great<br>Indra, smiting the Danavas with his thunderbolt, Bhimasena will, mace in<br>hand, slay all my sons! Incapable of being withstood or resisted, of<br>fierce impetus and powers, and with eyes of a coppery hue, I behold even<br>now that Vrikodara failing upon my sons. Without mace or bow, without car<br>or coat of mail, fighting with his bare arms only, what man is there that<br>can stand before him? Bhishma, that regenerate Drona, and Kripa the son<br>of Saradwat,&#8212;these are as much acquainted as I myself with the energy of<br>the intelligent Bhima. Acquainted with the practice of those that are<br>noble, and desirous of death in battle, these bulls among men will take<br>their stand in the van of our army. Destiny is everywhere powerful,<br>especially in the case of a male person, for beholding the victory of the<br>Pandavas in battle, I do not yet restrain my sons. These mighty bowmen of<br>mine, desirous of treading in that ancient track leading up to heaven,<br>will lay down their lives in battle, taking care, however, of earthly<br>fame. O child, my sons are the same to these mighty bowmen as the<br>Pandavas are to them, for all of them are grandsons of Bhishma and<br>disciples of Drona and Kripa. O Sanjaya, the little acceptable services<br>that we have been able to do unto these three venerable ones, will<br>certainly be repaid by them owing to their own noble dispositions. It is<br>said that death in battle of a Kshatriya, who hath taken up arms and<br>desireth to observe Kshatriya practices is, indeed, both good and<br>meritorious. I weep, however, for all those that will fight against the<br>Pandavas. That very danger hath now come which was foreseen by Vidura at<br>the outset. It seems, O Sanjaya, that wisdom is incapable of dispelling<br>woe; on the other hand, it is overwhelming woe that dispelleth wisdom.<br>When the very sages, that are emancipated from all worldly concerns and<br>that behold, standing aloof, all the affairs of the universe, are<br>affected by prosperity and adversity, what wonder is there that I should<br>grieve, I who have my affections fixed on a thousand things such as sons,<br>kingdom, wives, grandsons, and relatives? What good can possibly be in<br>store for me on the accession of such a frightful danger? Reflecting on<br>every circumstance, I see the certain destruction of the Kurus. That<br>match at dice seems to be the cause of this great danger of the Kurus.<br>Alas, this sin was committed from temptation by foolish Duryodhana,<br>desirous of wealth; I believe all this to be the untoward effect of<br>ever-fleeting Time that bringeth on everything. Tied to the wheel of<br>Time, like its periphery, I am not capable of flying away from it. Tell<br>me, O Sanjaya, where shall I go? What shall I do, and, how shall I do it?<br>These foolish Kauravas will all be destroyed, their Time having come.<br>Helplessly I shall have to hear the wailing of women when my hundred sons<br>will all be slain. Oh, how may death come upon me? As a blazing fire in<br>the summer season., when urged by the wind, consumeth dry grass, so will<br>Bhima, mace in hand, and united with Arjuna, slay all on my side!'"
