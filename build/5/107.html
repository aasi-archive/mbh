                            "Narada said, 'Thus addressed by Viswamitra of great intelligence Galava<br>was filled with such anxiety that he could not sit or lie down, or take<br>his food. A prey to anxiety and regret, lamenting bitterly, and burning<br>with remorse, Galava grew pale, and was reduced to a skeleton. And<br>smitten with sorrow, O Suyodhana, he indulged in these lamentations,<br>'Where shall I find affluent friends? Where shall I find money? Have I<br>any savings? Where shall I find eight hundred steeds of lunar whiteness?<br>What pleasure can I have in eating? What happiness can be mine in objects<br>of enjoyment? The very love of life is extinct in me. What need have I of<br>life? Repairing to the other shore of the great ocean, or to the furthest<br>verge of the earth, I will relinquish my life. Of what use can life be to<br>me? What happiness, without severe exertion, can be his who is poor,<br>unsuccessful, deprived of all the good things of life, and burthened with<br>debt? Death is preferable to life as regards him who having enjoyed the<br>wealth of friends through their friendship for himself, is unable to<br>return their favour. The religious acts of that man lose their efficacy<br>who having promised to do an act fails to perform it and is thus stained<br>with falsehood. One that is stained by falsehood cannot have beauty, or<br>children, or power, or influence. How, therefore, can such a one attain<br>to a blissful state? What ungrateful man hath ever earned fame? Where,<br>indeed, is his place, and where his happiness? An ungrateful person can<br>never win esteem and affection. Salvation also can never be his. He that<br>is destitute of wealth is a wretch that can scarcely be said to live.<br>Such a wretch cannot support his kinsmen and friends. Unable to make any<br>return for the benefits he receiveth, he certainly meeteth with<br>destruction. Even I am that wretch, ungrateful, destitute of resources,<br>and stained with falsehood, for having obtained my objects from my<br>preceptor, I am unable to do his bidding. Having first endeavoured to the<br>utmost, I will lay down my life. Before this, I never craved for any<br>thing from the very gods. The deities regard me for this in sacrificial<br>place. I will go and seek the protection of Vishnu, the divine Lord of<br>the three worlds, of Krishna the great refuge of all who are blessed with<br>protection. Bowing down unto him, I desire to see that highest of all<br>ascetics, the Eternal Krishna from whom flow all those possessions and<br>enjoyments that are owned by both gods and Asuras.' And while Galava was<br>thus lamenting, his friend Garuda, the son of Vinata, appeared in his<br>sight. And Garuda, from desire of doing him good, cheerfully addressed<br>him, saying, Thou art a dear friend, of mine. It is the duty of a friend,<br>when himself in prosperity, to look to the accomplishment of the wishes<br>of his friends. The prosperity that I have, O Brahmana, is constituted by<br>Vasava's younger brother Vishnu. Before this, I spoke to him on thy<br>behalf and he hath been pleased to grant my wishes. Come now, we will go<br>together. I will bear thee comfortably to the other shore of the ocean,<br>or to the furthest extremity of the earth. Come, O Galava, do not tarry.'"
