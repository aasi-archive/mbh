                            "Vaisampayana said, 'And after all the kings had been seated and perfect<br>silence had ensued, Krishna possessing fine teeth and having a voice deep<br>as that of the drum, began to speak. And Madhava although he addressed<br>Dhritarashtra, spoke in a voice deep as the roll of clouds in the rainy<br>season, making the whole assembly hear. And he said, 'In order that, O<br>Bharata, peace may be established between the Kurus and the Pandavas<br>without a slaughter of the heroes, I have come hither. Besides this, O<br>king, I have no other beneficial words to utter, O chastiser of foes,<br>everything that should be learnt in this world is already known to thee.<br>This thy race, O king, owing to its learning and behaviour, and owing<br>also to its being adorned with every accomplishment, is most<br>distinguished among all royal dynasties. Joy in the happiness of others,<br>grief at sight of other people's misery, desire to alleviate distress,<br>abstention from injury, sincerity, forgiveness, and truth,&#8212;these, O<br>Bharata, prevail amongst the Kurus. Then thy race, therefore, O king, is<br>so noble, it would be a pity if anything improper were done by any one<br>belonging to it, and greater pity still if it were done by thee. O chief<br>of the Kurus, thou art the first of those that should restrain the Kurus<br>if they behave deceitfully towards strangers or those numbering with<br>themselves. Know, O thou of Kuru's race, that those wicked sons of thine,<br>headed by Duryodhana, abandoning both virtue and profit, disregarding<br>morality, and deprived of their senses by avarice, are now acting most<br>unrighteously towards, O bull of men, their foremost of kinsmen. That<br>terrible danger (which threatens all) hath its origin in the conduct of<br>the Kurus. If thou becomest indifferent to it, it will then produce a<br>universal slaughter. If, O Bharata, thou art willing, thou mayest be able<br>to allay that danger even yet, for, O bull of Bharata's race, peace, I<br>think, is not difficult of acquisition. The establishment of peace, O<br>king, depends on thee and myself, O monarch. Set right thy sons, O thou<br>of Kuru's race, and I will set the Pandavas right. Whatever be thy<br>command, O king, it behoveth thy sons with their followers to obey it. If<br>again they live in obedience to thee, that would be the very best they<br>could do. If thou strivest for peace by restraining thy sons, it will be<br>to thy profit, O king, as also to the benefit of the Pandavas. Having<br>reflected carefully, act thou thyself, O king. Let those sons of Bharata<br>(the Pandavas), be, O ruler of men, thy allies. Supported by the<br>Pandavas, O king, seek thou both religion and profit. By every exertion<br>in thy power, thou canst not have, O king, such allies as they who are<br>such. Protected by the illustrious sons of Pandu, Indra himself at the<br>head of the celestials will not be able to vanquish thee. How would it be<br>possible then for mere earthly kings to withstand thy prowess? If with<br>Bhishma, and Drona, and Kripa, and Karna, and Vivingsati, and<br>Aswatthaman, Vikarna, and Somadatta, and Vahlika and the chief of the<br>Sindhus, and the ruler of the Kalingas, and Sudakshina, the king of the<br>Kamvojas, there were Yudhishthira, and Bhimasena and Savyasachin, and the<br>twins, and if Satyaki of mighty energy, and Yuyutsu, that mighty car<br>warrior, are stationed, who is there, O bull of Bharata's race, of such<br>misdirected intelligence that would fight these? If, O slayer of foes,<br>thou hast both the Kurus and the Pandavas at thy back, the sovereignty of<br>the whole world and invincibility before all foes will be thine. All the<br>rulers of the earth, O monarch, that are either equal to thee or<br>superior, will then seek alliance with thee. Protected on all sides by<br>sons, grandsons, fathers, brothers, and friends, thou wilt then be able<br>to live in exceeding happiness. Keeping these before thee and treating<br>them with kindness as in days of yore, thou, O monarch, wilt enjoy the<br>sovereignty of the whole earth. With these as thy supporters and with the<br>sons of Pandu also, thou wilt, O Bharata, be able to conquer all thy<br>foes. Even this is thy best advantage. If, O chastiser of foes, thou art<br>united with thy sons and kinsmen and counsellors, thou wilt' enjoy<br>sovereignty of the whole earth won for thee by them. In battle, O great<br>king, nothing but wholesale destruction is visible. Indeed, in the<br>destruction of both the parties, what merit dost thou see? If the<br>Pandavas are slaughtered in battle, or if thy own mighty sons fall, tell<br>me, O bull of Bharata's race, what happiness wilt thou enjoy? All of them<br>are brave and skilled in weapons. All of them are desirous of battle, the<br>Pandavas as also thy sons. Oh, save them from the terrible danger that<br>threatens them. After the battle thou wilt not behold all the Kurus or<br>all the Pandavas, Car-warriors slain by car-warriors, thou wilt behold<br>the heroes of both parties reduced in numbers and strength. All the<br>rulers of the earth, O best of kings, have been assembled together.<br>Inflamed with wrath, they will certainly exterminate the population of<br>the earth. Save, O king, the world. Let not the population of the earth<br>be exterminated. O son of Kuru's race, if thou regainest thy natural<br>disposition, the earth may continue to be peopled as now. Save, O king,<br>these monarchs, who are all of pure descent, endued with modesty and<br>liberality and piety, and connected with on another in bonds of<br>relationship or alliance, from the terrible danger that threatens them.<br>Abandoning wrath and enmity, O chastiser of foes, let these kings,<br>embracing one another in peace, eating and drinking with one another,<br>dressed in excellent robes and decked with garlands, and doing courtesies<br>to one another, return to their respective homes. Let the affection thou<br>hadst for the Pandavas be revived in thy bosom, and let it, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, lead to the establishment of peace. Deprived of their<br>father while they were infants, they were brought up by thee. Cherish<br>them now as becomes thee, O bull of Bharata's race, as if they were thy<br>own sons. It is thy duty to protect them. And especially it is so when<br>they are distressed. O bull of Bharata's race, let not thy virtue and<br>profit be both lost. Saluting and propitiating thee, the Pandavas have<br>said unto thee, 'At thy command we have, with our followers, suffered<br>great misery. For these twelve years have we lived in the woods, and for<br>the thirteenth year have we lived incognito in an uninhabited part of the<br>world. We broke not our pledge, firmly believing that our father also<br>would abide by his. That we violated not our word is well-known to the<br>Brahman as who were with us. And as we, O bull of the Bharata race, have<br>abided by our promise, also do thou abide by thine. Long have we suffered<br>the greatest misery, but let us now have our share of the kingdom. Fully<br>conversant as thou art with virtue and profit, it behoveth thee to rescue<br>us. Knowing that our obedience is due to thee, we have quietly undergone<br>much misery. Behave thou then unto us like a father or brother. A<br>preceptor should behave as a preceptor towards his disciples, and as<br>disciples we are willing to behave as such towards thee, our preceptor.<br>Act thou, therefore, towards us as a preceptor should. If we go wrong, it<br>is the duty of our father to set us right. Therefore, set us on the way<br>and tread thou also the excellent path of righteousness.' Those sons of<br>thine, O bull of the Bharata race, have also said unto these kings<br>assembled in the court these words, 'If the members of an assembly are<br>conversant with morality, nothing improper should be permitted by them to<br>happen. Where, in the presence of the virtuous members of an assembly,<br>righteousness is sought to be overpowered by unrighteousness, and truth<br>by the untruth, it is those members themselves that are vanquished and<br>slain. When righteousness, pierced by unrighteousness, seeketh the<br>protection of an assembly, if the arrow is not extracted, it is the<br>members themselves that are pierced by that arrow. Indeed, in that case,<br>righteousness slayeth the members of that assembly, like a river eating<br>away the roots of the trees on its bank.' Judge now, O bull of the<br>Bharata race. The Pandavas, with their eyes turned towards righteousness<br>and reflecting on everything, are maintaining a calm attitude, and what<br>they have said is consistent with truth and virtue and justice. O ruler<br>of men, what canst thou say unto them, but that thou art willing to give<br>them back their kingdom? Let these rulers of earth that are sitting here<br>say (what the answer should be)! If it appears to thee that what I have<br>said after reflecting well on virtue to be true, save all these<br>Kshatriyas, O bull of the Bharata race, from the meshes of death. Effect<br>peace, O chief of Bharata's race, and yield not to anger. Giving unto the<br>Pandavas their just share of the paternal kingdom, enjoy thou then, with<br>thy sons, O chastiser of foes, happiness and luxury, thy wishes being all<br>crowned with success. Know that Yudhishthira always treadeth the path<br>that is trod by the righteous. Thou knowest also, O king, what the<br>behaviour of Yudhishthira is towards thee and thy sons. Although thou<br>hadst sought to burn him to death and hadst exiled him from human<br>habitation, yet he came back and once more repose confidence in thee.<br>Again, didst thou with thy sons, banish him to Indraprastha? While there,<br>he brought all the kings of the earth to subjection and yet looked up to<br>thy face, O king, without seeking to disregard thee. Although he behaved<br>in this way, yet Suvala's son, desirous of robbing him of his dominions<br>and wealth and possessions, applied the very efficacious means of dice.<br>Reduced to that condition and even beholding Krishna dragged into the<br>assembly, Yudhishthira of immeasurable soul, did not yet swerve from the<br>duties of a Kshatriya. As regards myself, I desire, O Bharata, thy good<br>as also theirs. For the sake of virtue, of profit, of happiness, make<br>peace, O king, and do not allow the Earth's population to be slaughtered,<br>regarding evil as good and good as evil. Restrain thy sons, O monarch,<br>who have from covetousness proceeded too far. As regards the sons of<br>Pritha, they are equally ready to wait upon thee in dutiful service or to<br>fight. That which, O chastiser of foes, seems to thee to be for thy good,<br>do thou adopt!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'All the rulers of earth there present highly<br>applauded these words of Kesava within their hearts, but none of them<br>ventured to say anything in the presence of Duryodhana.'
