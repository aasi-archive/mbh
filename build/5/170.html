                            "Bhishma said, 'I have now, O king, indicated who thy Rathas are and who<br>thy Atirathas and half Rathas. Listen now to the tale of Rathas and<br>Atirathas among the Pandavas. If thou feelest any curiosity, listen then,<br>O king, with these monarchs, to the tale of Rathas in the army of the<br>Pandavas. The king himself, son of Pandu and Kunti, is a mighty Ratha.<br>Without doubt, O sire, be will glide along the field of battle like a<br>blazing fire; Bhimasena, O king, is regarded equal to eight Rathas. In an<br>encounter with the mace or even with arrows, there is none equal to him.<br>Endued with the strength of ten thousand elephants, and filled with<br>pride, in energy he is superhuman. Those two bulls among men, the sons of<br>Madri, are both Rathas. In beauty, they are equal to the twin Aswinis,<br>and they are endued with great energy. Stationed at the head of their<br>divisions, all of them, remembering their great sufferings, without<br>doubt, wander along the field like so many Indras! All of them are endued<br>with high souls, and are tall in stature like the trunks of Sala trees.<br>Taller than other men by half-a-cubit in stature, all the sons of Pandu<br>are brave as lions and endued with great strength. All of them, O sire,<br>have practised Brahmacharya vows and other ascetic austerities. Endued<br>with modesty, those tigers among men are possessed of fierce strength<br>like the veritable tigers. In speed, in smiting, and in crushing (foes),<br>all of them are more than human. All of them, on the occasion of the<br>campaign of universal conquest, vanquished great kings, O bull of<br>Bharata's race! No other men can wield their weapons, maces, and shafts.<br>Indeed, O Kaurava, there are no men that can even string their bows, or<br>uplift their maces, or shoot their arrows in battle. In speed, in hitting<br>the aim, in eating, and in sports on the dust, they used to beat all of<br>you even when they were children. Possessed of fierce might they will,<br>when they encounter this force, exterminate it in battle. A collision,<br>therefore, with them is not desirable. Each of them can alone slay all<br>the kings of the earth! That which happened, O great king, on the<br>occasion of the Rajasuya sacrifice, had occurred before thy very eyes!<br>Remembering the sufferings of Draupadi and the harsh speeches uttered<br>after their defeat at dice, they will wander in battle like so many<br>Rudras. As regards Gudakesha, of reddish eyes, having Narayana for his<br>ally, there is not among both the armies any brave car-warrior that can<br>be regarded as his equal. Let men alone, it hath not been heard by us<br>that even among gods, Asuras, Uragas, Rakshasas and Yakshas, there ever<br>was born before, or there ever will be born hereafter, any car-warrior<br>like unto him! O great king, intelligent Partha owneth that car which is<br>furnished with the banner bearing the device of the ape; the driver of<br>that car is Vasudeva! Dhananjaya himself is the warrior who fighteth from<br>it; his, again, is that celestial bow called Gandiva; he owneth again<br>those steeds fleet as the wind; his coat of mail is impenetrable and of<br>celestial make; his two large quivers are inexhaustible; his arms have<br>been obtained from the great Indra, Rudra, Kuvera, Yama and Varuna; and<br>upon his car, again, are those maces of frightful mien, and diverse other<br>great weapons having the thunderbolt amongst them! What car-warrior can<br>be regarded as his equal, who, stationed on a single car' slew in battle<br>a thousand Danavas, having their abode in Hiranyapura? Inflamed with<br>wrath, possessed of great might and prowess, incapable of being baffled,<br>that mighty-armed warrior, while protecting his own army, will certainly<br>exterminate thy troops! Myself and preceptor (Drona) among the two<br>armies, and no third car-warrior, O great king, can advance against<br>Dhananjaya, that scatterer of arrowy showers! Pouring his shafts, like<br>the very clouds during the rainy season when propelled by mighty winds,<br>that son of Kunti when Vasudeva as his second, steppeth for battle! He is<br>skilful and young, while both of us are old and worn out!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of Bhishma, and<br>recollecting with trembling heart, the well-known valour of the sons of<br>Pandu and thinking of it, as if it were present before their eyes, the<br>massive arms of kings, decked with bracelets and smeared with<br>sandal-paste, seemed to hang down divested of might.'"
