                            "Salya said, 'Now when the great Indra, the intelligent chief of the<br>gods, was deliberating with the guardians of the world and other deities<br>upon the means of slaying Nahusha, there appeared at that spot the<br>venerable ascetic Agastya. And Agastya honoured the lord of the gods and<br>said, 'How fortunate that thou art flourishing after the destruction of<br>that being of universal form, as also that of Vritra. And how fortunate.<br>O Purandara, Nahusha hath been hurled from the throne of heaven. How<br>fortunate, O slayer of Vala, that I behold thee with all thy enemies<br>killed.'<br><br>"Indra said, 'Hath thy journey hither been pleasant, O great saint, I am<br>delighted to see thee. Accept from me water for washing thy feet and<br>face, as also the Arghya and the cow.'<br><br>"Salya continued, 'Indra, well-pleased, began to question that best of<br>saints and greatest of Brahmanas when he was seated on a seat after<br>receiving due honours, thus, O revered saint, O best of Brahmanas, I wish<br>to have it recited by thee how Nahusha of vicious soul was hurled from<br>heaven.'<br><br>"Agastya said, 'Listen, O Indra, to the pleasant narrative how the wicked<br>and vicious Nahusha, intoxicated with pride of strength, had been hurled<br>from heaven. The pure-spirited Brahmanas and celestial saints, while<br>carrying him, weary with toil, questioned that vicious one, O best of<br>victors, saying, 'O Indra, there are certain hymns in the Vedas, directed<br>to be recited while sprinkling the cows. Are they authentic or not?<br>Nahusha, who had lost his senses by the operation of the Tamas, told them<br>that they were not authentic.' The saints then said, 'Thou art tending<br>towards unrighteousness; thou takest not to the righteous path. The<br>greatest saints have formerly said they are authentic, O Indra.' And<br>incited by Untruth, he touched me on my head with his foot. At this, O<br>lord of Sachi, he became divested of power and of good looks. Then, as he<br>was agitated and overpowered with fear, I spoke to him, 'Since thou hast<br>pronounced as spurious the unexceptionable hymns of the Veda which have<br>been recited by Brahmarsis (Brahmana saints), and since thou hast touched<br>my head with thy foot, and since thou, O ignorant wretch, hast turned<br>these unapproachable saints, equal to Brahma, into animals for carrying<br>thee, therefore, O wretch, be divested of thy lustre, and being hurled<br>headlong, fall thou from heaven, the effect of all thy good deeds being<br>exhausted. For ten thousand years, thou shalt, in the form of an enormous<br>snake, roam over the earth. When that period is full, thou mayst come<br>back to heaven. Thus hath that wretch been hurled from the throne of<br>heaven, O repressor of foes.' How fortunate, O Indra, that we are<br>flourishing now. That thorn of the Brahmanas hath been killed. O lord of<br>Sachi, repair thou to heaven, protect the worlds, subdue thy senses,<br>subdue thy foes, and be glorified by the great saints.'<br><br>"Salya continued, 'Then, O ruler of men, the gods, and the bands of great<br>saints were exceedingly pleased. And so also were the Pitris, the<br>Yakshas, the Snakes, the Rakshasas, the Gandharvas, and all the bands of<br>celestial nymphs. And the tanks, the rivers, the mountains, and the seas<br>also were highly pleased. And all came up and said, 'How fortunate, O<br>slayer of foes, that thou art flourishing! How fortunate, that the<br>intelligent Agastya hath killed the vicious Nahusha! How fortunate that<br>the vile individual hath been turned into a snake to roam over the<br>earth!'"
