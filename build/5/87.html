                            "Vidura said, 'O monarch, O best of men, thou art respected by three<br>worlds. Thou, O Bharata, art loved and regarded by every body. Venerable<br>in year as thou art, what thou wilt say at this age cap never be against<br>the dictates of the scriptures or the conclusions of well-directed<br>reason, for thy mind is ever calm. Thy subjects, O king, are well-assured<br>that, like characters on stone, light in the sun, and billows in the<br>ocean, virtue resideth in thee permanently. O monarch, every one is<br>honoured and made happy in consequence of thy numerous virtues. Strive,<br>therefore, with thy friends and kinsmen to retain those virtues of thine.<br>Oh, adopt sincerity of behaviour. Do not from folly, cause a wholesale<br>destruction of thy sons, grandsons, friends, kinsmen, and all that are<br>dear to thee. It is much, O king, that thou wishes to give unto Kesava as<br>thy guest. Know, however, that Kesava deserves all this and much more,<br>aye, the whole earth itself. I truly swear by my own soul that thou dost<br>not wish to give all this unto Krishna either from motives of virtue or<br>for the object of doing what is agreeable to him. O giver of great<br>wealth, all this betrays only deception, falsehood, and insincerity. By<br>the external acts, O king, I know thy secret purpose. The five Pandavas,<br>O king, desire only five villages. Thou, however, dost not wish to give<br>them even that. Thou art, therefore, unwilling to make peace. Thou<br>seekest to make the mighty-armed hero of Vrishni's race thy own by means<br>of thy wealth; in foot, by this means, thou seekest to separate Kesava<br>from the Pandavas. I tell thee, however, that thou art unable, by wealth,<br>or attention, or worship, to separate Krishna from Dhananjaya. I know<br>magnanimity of Krishna; I know firm devotion of Arjuna towards him, I<br>know that Dhananjaya, who is Kesava's life, is incapable of being given<br>up by the latter. Save only a vessel of water, save only the washing of<br>his feet, save only the (usual) enquiries after the welfare (of those he<br>will see), Janardana will not accept any other hospitality or set his<br>eyes on any other thing. Offer him, however, O king, that hospitality<br>which is the most agreeable to that illustrious one deserving of every<br>respect, for there is no respect that may not be offered to Janardana.<br>Give unto Kesava, O king, that object in expectation of which, from<br>desire of benefiting both parties, he cometh to the Kurus. Kesava desires<br>peace to be established between thee and Duryodhana on one side and the<br>Pandavas on the other. Follow his counsels, O, monarch. Thou art their<br>father, O king, and the Pandavas are thy sons. Thou art old, and they are<br>children to thee in years, behave as father towards them, that are<br>disposed to pay thee filial regard."
