                            "Vidura said, 'O son of Vichitravirya, Manu, the son of the Self-created,<br>hath, O king, spoken of the following seven and ten kinds of men, as<br>those that strike empty space with their fists, or seek to bend the<br>vapoury bow of Indra in the sky, or desire to catch the intangible rays<br>of the sun. These seven and ten kinds of foolish men are as follow: he<br>who seeketh to control a person that is incapable of being controlled; he<br>who is content with small gains; he who humbly pays court to enemies; he<br>who seeks to restrain women's frailty; he who asketh him for gifts who<br>should never be asked; he who boasteth, having done anything; he who,<br>born in a high family, perpetrateth an improper deed; he who being weak<br>always wageth hostilities with one that is powerful; he who talketh to a<br>person listening scoffingly; he who desireth to have that which is<br>unattainable; he who being a father-in-law, jesteth with his<br>daughter-in-law; he who boasteth at having his alarms dispelled by his<br>daughter-in-law; he who scattereth his own seeds in another's field; he<br>who speaketh ill of his own wife; he who having received anything from<br>another sayeth that he doth not remember it, he who, having given away<br>anything in words in holy places, boasteth at home when asked to make<br>good his words, and he who striveth to prove the truth of what is false.<br>The envoys of Yama, with nooses in hand, drag those persons to hell. One<br>should behave towards another just as that other behaveth towards him.<br>Even this is consistent with social polity. One may behave deceitfully<br>towards him that behaveth deceitfully, but honestly towards him that is<br>honest in his behaviour. Old age killeth beauty; patience, hope; death,<br>life; the practice of virtue, worldly enjoyments; lust, modesty;<br>companionship with the wicked, good behaviour; anger, prosperity; and<br>pride, everything.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Man hath been spoken of in all the Vedas as having<br>hundred years for the period of his life. For what reason then, do not<br>all men attain the allotted period?'<br><br>"Vidura said, 'Excess of pride, excess in speech, excess in eating,<br>anger, the desire of enjoyment, and intestine dissensions,&#8212;these, O<br>king, are six sharp swords that cut off the period of life allotted to<br>creatures. It is these which kill men, and not death. Knowing this,<br>blessed be thou!'<br><br>'He who appropriates to himself the wife of one who hath confided in him;<br>he who violates the bed of his preceptor; that Brahmana, O Bharata, who<br>becomes the husband of a Sudra woman, or drinks wines; he who commendeth<br>Brahmanas or becometh their master, or taketh away the lands that support<br>them; and he who taketh the lives of those who yield asking for<br>protection, are all guilty of the sin of slaying Brahmanas. The Vedas<br>declare that contact with these requires expiation. He that accepts the<br>teaching of the wise; he that is acquainted with the rules of morality;<br>he that is liberal; he that eateth having first dedicated the food to the<br>gods and Pitris; he that envieth none; he that is incapable of doing<br>anything that injureth others; he that is grateful, truthful, humble and<br>learned, succeedeth in attaining to heaven.<br><br>'They are abundant, O king, that can always speak agreeable words. The<br>speaker, however, is rare, as also the hearer, of words that are<br>disagreeable but medicinal. That man who, without regarding what is<br>agreeable or disagreeable to his master but keeping virtue alone in view,<br>sayeth what is unpalatable, but medicinal, truly addeth to the strength<br>of the king. For the sake of the family a member may be sacrificed; for<br>the sake of the village, a family may be sacrificed; for the sake of a<br>kingdom a village may be sacrificed; and for the sake of one's soul, the<br>whole earth may be sacrificed. One should protect his wealth in view of<br>the calamities that may overtake him; by his wealth one should protect<br>his wives, and by both his wealth and wives one should protect his own<br>self. From very olden times it hath been seen that gambling provoketh<br>quarrels. Therefore, he that is wise, should not resort to it even in<br>jest. O son of Pratipa, at the time of that gambling match I told thee, O<br>king&#8212;this is not proper. But, O son of Vichitravirya, like medicine to a<br>sick man, those words of mine were not agreeable to thee. O king, thou<br>desirest to vanquish the sons of Pandu, who are just as peacocks of<br>variegated plumage, whereas thy sons are all as crows. Forsaking lions<br>thou art protecting jackals! O king, when the time cometh, thou wilt have<br>to grieve for all this. That master, O sire, who doth not give vent to<br>his displeasure with devoted servants zealously pursuing his good,<br>enlisteth the confidence of his servants. In fact, the latter adhere to<br>him even in distress. By confiscating the grants to one's servants or<br>stopping their pay, one should not seek to amass wealth, for even<br>affectionate counsellors deprived of their means of life and enjoyment,<br>turn against him and leave him (in distress). Reflecting first on all<br>intended acts and adjusting the wages and allowances of servants with his<br>income and expenditure, a king should make proper alliances, for there is<br>nothing that cannot be accomplished by alliances. That officer who fully<br>understanding the intentions of his royal master dischargeth all duties<br>with alacrity, and who is respectable himself and devoted to his master,<br>always telleth what is for his master's good, and who is fully acquainted<br>with the extent of his own might and with that also of those against,<br>whom he may be engaged, should be regarded by the king as his second<br>self. That servant, however, who commanded (by his master) disregardeth<br>the latter's injunctions and who enjoined to do anything refuseth to<br>submit, proud as he is of his own intelligence and given to arguing<br>against his master, should be got rid of without the least delay. Men of<br>learning say that a servant should be endued with these eight qualities,<br>viz., absence of pride, ability, absence of procrastination, kindness,<br>cleanliness, incorruptibility, birth in a family free from the taint of<br>disease, and weightiness of speech. No man should confidently enter an<br>enemy's house after dusk even with notice. One should not at night lurk<br>in the yard of another's premises, nor should one seek to enjoy a woman<br>to whom the king himself might make love. Never set thyself against the<br>decision to which a person hath arrived who keepeth low company and who<br>is in the habit of consulting all he meeteth. Never tell him,&#8212;I do not<br>believe thee,&#8212;but assigning some reason send him away on a pretext. A<br>king who is exceedingly merciful, a woman of lewd character, the servant<br>of a king, a son, a brother, a widow having an infant son one serving in<br>the army, and one that hath suffered great losses, should never be<br>engaged in pecuniary transactions of lending or borrowing. These eight<br>qualities shed a lustre on men, viz., wisdom, high lineage, acquaintance<br>with scriptures, self-restraint, prowess, moderation in speech, gift to<br>the extent of one's power, and gratefulness. These high qualities, O<br>sire, are necessarily brought together by one only by gifts. When the<br>king favours a person, that incident (of royal favour) bringeth in all<br>others and holdeth them together. He that performeth ablutions winneth<br>these ten, viz., strength, beauty, a clear voice, capacity to utter all<br>the alphabetical sounds, delicacy of touch, fineness of scent,<br>cleanliness, gracefulness, delicacy of limbs, and beautiful women. He<br>that eateth sparingly winneth these six, viz., health, long life, and<br>ease; his progeny also becometh healthy, and nobody reproacheth him for<br>gluttony. One should not give shelter to these in his house, viz., one<br>that always acteth improperly, one that eateth too much, one that is<br>hated by all, one that is exceedingly deceitful, one that is cruel, one<br>that is ignorant of the proprieties of time and place, and one that<br>dresseth indecently. A person, however distressed, should never solicit a<br>miser for alms, or one that speaketh ill of others, or one that is<br>unacquainted with the shastras, or a dweller in the woods, or one that is<br>cunning, or one that doth not regard persons worthy of regard, or one<br>that is cruel, or one that habitually quarrels with others, or one that<br>is ungrateful. A person should never wait upon these six worst of men,<br>viz., one that is a foe, one that always errs, one that is wedded to<br>falsehood, one that is wanting in devotion to the gods, one that is<br>without affection, and one that always regards himself competent to do<br>everything. One's purposes depend (for their success) on means; and means<br>are dependent, again, on the nature of the purposes (sought to be<br>accomplished by them). They are intimately connected with each other, so<br>that success depends on both. Begetting sons and rendering them<br>independent by making some provision for them, and bestowing maiden<br>daughters on eligible persons, one should retire to the woods, and desire<br>to live as a Muni. One should, for obtaining the favours of the Supreme<br>Being, do that which is for the good of all creatures as also for his own<br>happiness, for it is this which is the root of the successful of all<br>one's objects. What anxiety hath he for a livelihood that hath<br>intelligence, energy, prowess, strength, alacrity and perseverance?<br><br>'Behold the evils of a rupture with the Pandavas which would sadden the<br>very gods with Sakra. These are, first, enmity between them that are all<br>thy sons; secondly, a life of continued anxiety; thirdly, the loss of the<br>fair fame of the Kurus; and lastly, the joy of those that are thy<br>enemies. The wrath of Bhishma, O thou of the splendour of Indra, of<br>Drona, and the king Yudhishthira, will consume the whole world, like a<br>comet of large proportions falling transversely on the earth. Thy hundred<br>sons and Karna and the sons of Pandu can together rule the vast earth<br>with the belt of the seas. O king, the Dhartarashtras constitute a forest<br>of which the Pandavas are, I think, tigers. O, do not cut down that<br>forest with its tigers! O, let not the tigers be driven from that forest!<br>There can be no forest without tigers, and no tigers without a forest.<br>The forest shelters the tigers and tigers guard the forest!'<br><br>They that are sinful never seek so much to ascertain the good qualities<br>of others as to ascertain their faults. He that desires the highest<br>success in all matters connected with worldly profit, should from the<br>very beginning practise virtue, for true profit is never separated from<br>heaven. He whose soul hath been dissociated from sin and firmly fixed on<br>virtue, hath understood all things in their natural and adventitious<br>states; he that followeth virtue, profit, and desire, in proper seasons,<br>obtaineth, both here and hereafter, a combination of all three. He that<br>restraineth the force of both anger and joy, and never, O king, loseth<br>his senses under calamities, winneth prosperity. Listen to me, O king.<br>Men are said to have five different kinds of strength, Of these, the<br>strength of arms is regarded to be of the most inferior kind. Blessed be<br>thou, the acquisition of good counsellors is regarded as the second kind<br>of strength. The wise have said that the acquisition of wealth is the<br>third kind of strength. The strength of birth, O king, which one<br>naturally acquireth from one's sires and grandsires, is regarded as the<br>fourth kind of strength. That, however, O Bharata, by which all these are<br>won, and which is the foremost of all kinds of strength, is called the<br>strength of the intellect. Having provoked the hostility of a person who<br>is capable of inflicting great injury on a fellow creature, one should<br>not gather assurance from the thought that one liveth at a distance from<br>the other. Who that is wise that can place his trust on women, kings,<br>serpents, his own master, enemies, enjoyments, and period of life? There<br>are no physicians nor medicines for one that hath been struck by the<br>arrow of wisdom. In the case of such a person neither the mantras of<br>homa, nor auspicious ceremonies, nor the mantras of the Atharva Veda, nor<br>any of the antidotes of poison, are of any efficacy. Serpents, fire,<br>lions, and consanguineous relatives,&#8212;none of these, O Bharata, should be<br>disregarded by a man; all of these are possessed of great power. Fire is<br>a thing of great energy in this world. It lurketh in wood and never<br>consumeth it till it is ignited by others. That very fire, when brought<br>out by friction, consumeth by its energy not only the wood in which it<br>lurketh, but also an entire forest and many other things. Men of high<br>lineage are just like fire in energy. Endued with forgiveness, they<br>betray no outward symptoms of wrath and are quiet like fire in wood.<br>Thou, O king, with thy sons art possessed of the virtue of creepers, and<br>the sons of Pandu are regarded as Sala trees. A creeper never groweth<br>unless there is a large tree to twine round. O king, O son of Ambika, thy<br>son is as a forest. O sire, know that the Pandavas are the lions of that<br>forest. Without its lions the forest is doomed to destruction, and lions<br>also are doomed to destruction without the forest (to shelter them).'"
