                            "Sanjaya said, It is even so, O great king, as thou, O Bharata, sayest.<br>On the event of battle, the destruction of the Kshatriyas by means of<br>Gandiva is certain. This, however, I do not understand, how when thou art<br>always wise and especially acquainted with the prowess of Savyasachin,<br>thou followest yet the counsels of thy sons. Having O bull of the Bharata<br>race, injured the sons of Pritha from the very beginning, having in fact,<br>committed sins repeatedly, this is not, O great king, the time (to<br>grieve). He that occupies the position of a father and a friend, if he is<br>always watchful and of good heart, should seek the welfare (of his<br>children); but he that injures, cannot be called a father. Hearing of the<br>defeat of the Pandavas at dice, thou hadst, O king, laughed like a child,<br>saying, 'This is won, this is acquired!' When the harshest speeches were<br>addressed to the sons of Pritha, thou didst not then interfere, pleased<br>at the prospect of thy sons winning the whole kingdom. Thou couldst not<br>however, then see before thee inevitable fall. The country of the Kurus,<br>including the region called Jangala is, O king, thy paternal kingdom.<br>Thou hast, however, obtained the whole earth by those heroes. Won by the<br>strength of their arms, the sons of Pritha made over thee this extensive<br>empire. Thou thinkest, however, O best of kings, that all this was<br>acquired by thee. When thy sons, seized by the king of the Gandharvas,<br>were about to sink in a shoreless sea without a raft to save them, it was<br>Partha, O king, that brought them back. Thou hadst, like a child,<br>repeatedly laughed, O monarch, at the Pandavas when they were defeated at<br>dice and were going into exile. When Arjuna poureth a shower of keen<br>arrows, the very oceans dry up, let alone beings of flesh and blood.<br>Falguna is the foremost of all shooters; Gandiva is the foremost of all<br>bows; Kesava is the foremost of all beings; the Sudarsana is the foremost<br>of all weapons; and of cars, that furnished with the banner bearing the<br>blazing Ape on it is the foremost. That car of his, bearing all these and<br>drawn by white steeds, will, O king, consume us all in battle like the<br>upraised wheel of Time. O bull of the Bharata race, his is even now the<br>whole earth and he is the foremost of all kings, who hath Bhima and<br>Arjuna to fight for him. Beholding the host sinking in despair when<br>smitten by Bhima, the Kauravas headed by Duryodhana will all meet<br>destruction. Struck with the fear of Bhima and Arjuna, the sons, O king,<br>and the kings following them, will not, O lord, be able to win victory.<br>The Matsyas, the Panchalas, the Salways and the Surasenas, all decline to<br>pay thee homage now and all disregard thee. Acquainted with the energy of<br>that wise king, all of them, however, have joined that son of Pritha, and<br>for their devotion to him they are always opposed to thy sons. He that,<br>by his evil deeds, afflicted the sons of Pandu, who are all wedded to<br>virtue and undeserving of destruction, he that hateth them even<br>now,&#8212;that sinful man, O monarch, who is none else than thy son,&#8212;should,<br>with all his adherents, be checked by all means. It behoveth thee not to<br>bewail in this strain. Even this was said by myself as well as by the<br>wise Vidura at the time of the gambling match at dice. These thy<br>lamentations in connection with the Pandavas, as if thou wert a helpless<br>person, are, O king, all useless.'"
