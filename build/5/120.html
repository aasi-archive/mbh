                            "Narada said, 'King Yayati then, desirous again of disposing of his<br>daughter in Swayamvara, went to a hermitage on the confluence of the<br>Ganga and the Yamuna, taking Madhavi with him on a chariot, her person<br>decked with garlands of flowers. And both Puru and Yadu followed their<br>sister to that sacred asylum. And in that spot was assembled a vast<br>concourse of Nagas and Yakshas and human beings, of Gandharvas and<br>animals and birds, and of dwellers of mountains and trees and forests,<br>and of many inhabitants of that particular province. And the woods all<br>around that asylum were filled with numerous Rishis resembling Brahman<br>himself. And while the selection had commenced of husband, that maiden of<br>the fairest complexion, passing over all the bridegrooms there assembled,<br>selected the forest as her lord. Descending from her chariot and saluting<br>all her friends, the daughter of Yayati went into the forest which is<br>always sacred, and devoted herself to ascetic austerities. Reducing her<br>body by means of fasts of various kinds and religious rites and rigid<br>vows, she adopted the deer's mode of life And subsisting upon soft and<br>green grass-blades, resembling the sprouts of lapis lazuli and which were<br>both bitter and sweet to the taste, and drinking the sweet, pure, cool,<br>crystal, and very superior water of sacred mountain-streams, and<br>wandering with the deer in forests destitute of lions and tigers, in<br>deserts free from forest-conflagration, and in thick woods, that maiden,<br>leading the life of a wild doe, earned great religious merit by the<br>practice of Brahmacharya austerities.<br><br>'(Meanwhile) king Yayati, following the practice of kings before him,<br>submitted to the influence of Time, after having lived for many thousands<br>of years. The progeny of two of his sons&#8212;those foremost of men&#8212;Puru and<br>Yadu, multiplied greatly, and in consequence thereof, Nahusha's son won<br>great respect both in this and the other world. O monarch, dwelling in<br>heaven, king Yayati, resembling a great Rishi, became an object of much<br>regard, and enjoyed the highest fruits of those regions. And after many<br>thousands of years had passed away in great happiness, on one occasion<br>while seated among the illustrious royal sages and great Rishis, king<br>Yayati, from folly, ignorance, and pride, mentally disregarded all the<br>gods and Rishis, and all human beings. Thereat the divine Sakra&#8212;the<br>slayer of Vala&#8212;at once read his heart. And those royal sages also<br>addressed him saying, 'Fie, fie.' And beholding the son of Nahusha, the<br>questions were asked, 'Who is this person? What king's son is he? Why is<br>he in heaven? By what acts hath he won success? Where did he earn ascetic<br>merit? For what hath he been known here? Who knoweth him? The dwellers of<br>heaven, thus speaking of-that monarch, asked one another these questions<br>about Yayati, that ruler of men. And hundreds of heaven's charioteers,<br>and hundreds of those that kept heaven's gates, and of those what were in<br>charge of heaven's seats, thus questioned, all answered, 'We do not know<br>him.' And the minds of all were temporarily clouded, so that none<br>recognised the king and thereupon the monarch was soon divested of his<br>splendour.'"
