                            "Bhishma said, 'This thy maternal uncle Sakuni is, O king, equal to a<br>single Ratha. Having caused the (present) hostilities (to break out) with<br>the sons of Pandu, he will fight. There is no doubt in this. His troops<br>are irresistible when rushing to battle. Armed with various kinds of<br>weapons in abundance, in speed, they are equal to the very wind. The<br>mighty bowman (Aswatthaman) who is Drona's son surpasseth all bowmen.<br>Acquainted with all modes of warfare, and of unbaffled weapons, he is a<br>Maharatha. Like the wielder of Gandiva, the shafts of this warrior, shot<br>from his bow, proceed in a continuous line, touching one another. If he<br>wishes it, this Maharatha is capable of consuming the three worlds.<br>Engaged in austerities in his hermitage, he hath, by these, increased<br>both his fury and energy. Possessed of great intelligence, he hath been<br>favoured by Drona with (the gift of all) celestial weapons. There is,<br>however, O bull of Bharata's race, one great defect in him, in<br>consequence of which, O best of kings, I do not regard him either as a<br>Ratha or a Maharatha. This regenerate man is exceedingly fond of living,<br>life being very dear to him. Amongst the warriors of both armies there is<br>no one who can be regarded as his peer. On even a single car he can<br>annihilate the very army of the celestials. Possessed of a strong frame,<br>he can split the very mountains by the flaps of his bow-string, striking<br>against the leathern fence on his left arm. Endued with innumerable<br>qualities, this smiter of fierce effulgence will wander (over the field<br>of battle), incapable of being withstood like Yama himself, mace in hand.<br>Resembling the fire at the end of the Yuga as regards his fury, possessed<br>of leonine neck, and endued with great lustre, Aswatthaman will<br>extinguish the embers of this battle between the Bharata's. His father<br>(Drona) is endued with great energy, and though aged, is still superior<br>to many young men. He will achieve great feats in battle. I have no doubt<br>of this. Staying immovably (on the field), he will consume Yudhishthira's<br>troops. The Pandava army will play the part of the dry grass and fuel in<br>which that fire will originate, while the impetus of his own weapons will<br>be the wind for fanning it into a (mighty) flame. This bull among men, is<br>a leader of bands of car-warriors. The son of Bharadwaja will achieve<br>fierce feats for thy good! The preceptor of all Kshatriyas of royal<br>lineage, the venerable preceptor, will exterminate the Srinjayas.<br>Dhananjaya, however, is dear to him. This mighty bowman, therefore,<br>remembering his own celebrated and highly meritorious services as<br>preceptor, will never be able to slay Partha who is capable of achieving<br>great feats without any trouble. O hero, Drona always boasteth of the<br>numerous accomplishments of Partha. Indeed, Bharadwaja looketh on him<br>with greater affection than on his own son. Endued with great prowess, he<br>can, on a single car, beat in battle, by means of his celestial weapons,<br>all the gods, Gandharvas, and human beings united together. That tiger<br>among kings, is, O monarch, one of thy Maharathas. Capable of breaking<br>the car-ranks of hostile heroes, he, in my judgment, is one of thy<br>foremost of car-warriors. Afflicting the ranks of the enemy at the head<br>of his own large force, he will consume the Panchalas like fire consuming<br>a heap of dry grass. Possessed of true fame, prince Vrihadvala is equal<br>to single Ratha. He, O monarch, will roam amid thy enemy's troops like<br>Death himself. His troops, O king of kings, accoutred in various kinds of<br>mail and armed with diverse kinds of weapons, will wander on the field,<br>slaying all the warriors opposed to them. Vrishasena, the son of Karna,<br>is one of thy foremost of car-warriors and is a Maharatha. That foremost<br>of mighty men will consume the troops of thy enemy. Endued with great<br>energy, Jalasandha, O king, is one of thy foremost of Rathas. Born in<br>Madhu's race, that slayer of hostile heroes, is prepared to cast away his<br>very life in battle. Skilled in battle, that mighty-armed warrior,<br>scattering the enemy's ranks before him, will fight in battle mounted on<br>car or from the elephant's back. That best of kings, O monarch, is in my<br>judgment, a Ratha. He will, in fierce battle, cast away for thy sake his<br>very life with all, his troops possessed of great prowess and acquainted<br>with all the modes of warfare, he will, O king, fight fearlessly with thy<br>foes in battle. Never retreating from battle, brave, and resembling Yama<br>himself, Vahlika, O king, is in my judgment, an Atiratha. Rushing to the<br>encounter he never cometh back. Indeed, he will slay hostile warriors in<br>battle like the Wind-god himself. That router of hostile car-ranks, that<br>car-warrior of wonderful feats in battle, commander of thy forces,<br>Satyavan is, O king, a Maharatha. He never cherisheth grief at the<br>prospect of battle. Confounding those warriors that stand in the way of<br>his car, he falleth upon them. Always displaying his prowess against the<br>enemy, that best of men will, for thy sake, in fierce press of battle,<br>achieve all that a good Kshatriya should. Thai chief of Rakshasas,<br>Alambhusha, of cruel deeds, is a Maharatha. Remembering his old<br>hostilities (with the Pandavas), he will commit great execution among the<br>foe. He is the best of Rathas amongst all the Rakshasa-warriors.<br>Possessing powers of illusion, and firm in enmity, he will wander<br>fiercely on the field. The ruler of Pragjyotisha, the brave Bhagadatta of<br>exceeding prowess, is the foremost of those holding the elephant hook,<br>and is skilled also in fighting from a car. An encounter took place<br>between him and the wielder of Gandiva for days together, O king, each<br>desirous of victory over the other. Then Bhagadatta, O son of Gandhari,<br>who regarded Indra as his friend, made friendship with (Indra's son) the<br>high-souled Pandava. Skilled in fight from the elephant's neck, this king<br>will fight in battle, like Vasava among the celestials, fighting from his<br>Airavata.'"
