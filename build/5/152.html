                            "Vaisampayana said, 'When Krishna had said this, all the monarchs there<br>were filled with joy. And the shout sent forth by those delighted kings<br>was tremendous. And the troops began to move about with great speed,<br>saying, 'Draw up, Draw up.' And the neighing of steeds and roars of<br>elephants and the clatter of car-wheels and the blare of conchs and the<br>sound of drums, heard everywhere, produced a tremendous din. And teeming<br>with cars and foot-soldiers and steeds and elephants, that invincible<br>host of the marching Pandavas moving hither and thither, donning their<br>coats of mail, and uttering their war-cries, looked like the impetuous<br>current of the Ganga when at its full, agitated with fierce eddies and<br>waves. And in the van of that host marched Bhimasena, and the two sons of<br>Madri encased in their coats of mail, and Subhadra's son and the five<br>sons of Draupadi and Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race. And the<br>Prabhadrakas and the Panchalas marched behind Bhimasena. And the din made<br>by the marching hosts, filled with joy, was like unto the roars of the<br>deep when the tide is highest on the day of the new moon. Indeed, the<br>tumult was such that it seemed to reach the very heavens. And capable of<br>breaking hostile ranks, those warriors cased in armour marched thus,<br>filled with joy. And Kunti's son, king Yudhishthira, amongst them<br>marched, taking with him the cars and other vehicles for transport, the<br>food-stores and fodder, the tents, carriages, and draught-cattle, the<br>cash-chests, the machines and weapons, the surgeons and physicians, the<br>invalids, and all the emaciated and weak soldiers, and all the attendants<br>and camp-followers. And truthful Draupadi, the princess of Panchala,<br>accompanied by the ladies of the household, and surrounded by servants<br>and maids, remained at Upaplavya. And causing their treasure and ladies<br>to be guarded by bodies of soldiers, some of whom were placed as<br>permanent lines of circumvallation and some ordered to move about at a<br>distance from this line, the Pandavas set out with their mighty host. And<br>having made presents of kine and gold to the Brahmanas, who walked around<br>them and uttered blessings, the sons of Pandu commenced the march on<br>their cars decked with jewels. And the princes of Kekaya, and<br>Dhrishtaketu, and the son of the king of the Kasis, and Srenimat, and<br>Vasudana, and the invincible Sikhandin, all hale and hearty, cased in<br>armour and armed with weapons and decked with ornaments, marched behind<br>Yudhishthira, keeping him in their centre. And in the rear, were Virata,<br>Yajnasena's son of the Somaka race (Dhrishtadyumna), Susarman,<br>Kuntibhoja, Dhrishtadyumna's sons, forty thousand cars, five times as<br>much cavalry, infantry ten times more numerous (than the last), and sixty<br>thousand elephants. And Anadhrishti, and Chekitana and Dhrishtaketu and<br>Satyaki all marched, surrounding Vasudeva and Dhananjaya. And reaching<br>the field of Kurukshetra with their forces in battle-array, those<br>smiters, the sons of Pandu, looked like roaring bulls. And entering the<br>field, those chastisers of foes blew their conchs. And Vasudeva and<br>Dhananjaya also blew their conchs. And hearing the blare of the conch<br>called Panchajanya, which resembled the roll of the thunder, all the<br>warriors (of the Pandava army) were filled with joy. And the leonine<br>roars of those warriors, endued with lightness of hand and speed of<br>motion, mingling with the blare of conchs and beat of Drums, made the<br>whole earth, the welkin, and the oceans resound therewith.'"
