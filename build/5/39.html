                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Man is not the disposer of either his prosperity or<br>adversity. He is like a wooden doll moved by strings. Indeed, the Creator<br>hath made man subject to Destiny. Go on telling me, I am attentive to<br>what thou sayest.'<br><br>"Vidura said, 'O Bharata, by speaking words out of season even Vrihaspati<br>himself incurreth reproach and the charge of ignorance, one becometh<br>agreeable by gift, another by sweet words, a third by the force of<br>incantation and drugs. He, however, that is naturally agreeable, always<br>remaineth so. He that is hated by another is never regarded by that other<br>as honest or intelligent or wise. One attributeth everything good to him<br>one loveth; and everything evil to him one hateth. O king, as soon as<br>Duryodhana was born I told thee,&#8212;thou shouldst abandon this one son, for<br>by abandoning him thou wouldst secure the prosperity of thy hundred<br>sons,&#8212;and by keeping him, destruction would overtake thy hundred sons,<br>that gain should never be regarded highly which leadeth to loss. On the<br>other hand, that loss even should be regarded highly which would bring on<br>gain. That is no loss, O king, which bringeth on gain. That, however,<br>should be reckoned as loss which is certain to bring about greater losses<br>still. Some become eminent in consequence of good qualities; others<br>become so in consequence of wealth. Avoid them, O Dhritarashtra, that are<br>eminent in wealth but destitute of good qualities!'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'All that you sayest is approved by the wise and is<br>for my future good. I dare not, however, abandon my son. It is well-known<br>that where there is righteousness there is victory.'<br><br>"Vidura said, 'He that is graced with every virtue and is endued with<br>humility, is never indifferent to even the minutest sufferings of living<br>creatures. They, however, that are ever employed in speaking ill of<br>others, always strive with activity quarrelling with one another and in<br>all matters, calculated to give pain to others. There is sin in accepting<br>gifts from, and danger in making gifts to them, whose very sight is<br>inauspicious and whose companionship is fraught with danger. They that<br>are quarrelsome, covetous, shameless, deceitful, are known unrighteous,<br>and their companionship should always be avoided. One should also avoid<br>those men that are endued with similar faults of a grave nature, When the<br>occasion that caused the friendship is over the friendship of those that<br>are low, the beneficial result of that connection, and the happiness also<br>derivable from it, all come to an end. They then strive to speak ill of<br>their (late) friend and endeavour to inflict loss on him, and if the loss<br>they sustain be even very small, for all that they, from want of<br>self-control, fail to enjoy peace. He that is learned, examining<br>everything carefully and reflecting well, should, from a distance, avoid<br>the friendship of vile and wicked-minded persons such as these. He that<br>helpeth his poor and wretched and helpless relatives, obtain children and<br>animals and enjoyeth prosperity that knoweth no end. They that desire<br>their own benefit should always succour their relatives. By every means,<br>therefore, O king, do thou seek the growth of thy race. Prosperity will<br>be thine, O Monarch, if thou behavest well towards all thy relatives.<br>Even relatives that are destitute of good qualities should be protected.<br>O bull of the Bharata race, how much more, therefore, should they be<br>protected that are endued with every virtue and are humbly expectant of<br>thy favours? Favour thou the heroic sons of Pandu, O monarch, and let a<br>few villages be assigned to them for their maintenance. By acting thus, O<br>king, fame will be thine in this world. Thou art old; thou shouldst,<br>therefore, control thy sons. I should say what is for thy good. Know me<br>as one that wishes well to thee. He that desireth his own good should<br>never quarrel, O sire, with his relatives. O bull of the Bharata race,<br>happiness should ever be enjoyed with one's relatives, and not without<br>them, to eat with one another, to talk with one another, and to love one<br>another, are what relatives should always do. They should never quarrel.<br>In this world it is the relatives that rescue, and the relatives that<br>ruin (relatives). Those amongst them that are righteous rescue; while<br>those that are unrighteous sink (their brethren). O king, be thou, O<br>giver of honours, righteous in thy conduct towards the sons of Pandu.<br>Surrounded by them, thou wouldst be unconquerable by thy foes. If a<br>relative shrinks in the presence of a prosperous relative, like a deer at<br>sight of a hunter armed with arrows, then the prosperous relative hath to<br>take upon himself all the sins of the other. O best of men, repentance<br>will be thine (for this thy inaction at present) when in future thou wilt<br>hear of the death of either the Pandavas or thy sons. O, think of all<br>this. When life itself is unstable, one should in the very beginning<br>avoid that act in consequence of which one would have to indulge in<br>regrets having entered the chamber of woe. True it is that a person other<br>than Bhargava, the author of the science of morality is liable to commit<br>actions that go against morality. It is seen, however, that a just notion<br>of consequence is present in all persons of intelligence. Thou art an<br>aged scion of Kuru's race. If Duryodhana inflicted these wrongs on the<br>sons of Pandu, it is thy duty, O king of men, to undo them all.<br>Re-instating them in their position, thou wilt, in this world, be<br>cleansed of all thy sins and be, O king of men, an object of worship with<br>even those that have their souls under control. Reflecting on the<br>well-spoken words of the wise according to their consequences, he that<br>engageth in acts never loseth fame. The knowledge imparted by even men of<br>learning and skill is imperfect, for that which is sought to be<br>inculcated is ill-understood, or, if understood, is not accomplished in<br>practice. That learned person who never doth an act, the consequences of<br>which are sin and misery, always groweth (in prosperity). The person,<br>however, of wicked soul, who from folly pursueth his sinful course<br>commenced before falleth into a slough of deep mire. He that is wise<br>should ever keep in view the (following) six conduits by which counsels<br>become divulged, and he that desireth success and a long dynasty should<br>ever guard himself from those six. They are, intoxication, sleep,<br>inattention to spies, set over one by another, one's own demeanour as<br>dependent on the working of one's own heart, confidence reposed on a<br>wicked counsellor, and unskilful envoys. Knowing these six doors (through<br>which counsels are divulged), he that keepeth them shut while pursuing<br>the attainment of virtue, profit, and desire, succeedeth in standing over<br>the heads of his foes. Without an acquaintance with the scriptures and<br>without waiting upon the old, neither virtue nor profit can be known (or<br>won) by persons blessed even with the intelligence of Vrihaspati. A thing<br>is lost if cast into the sea; words are lost if addressed to one that<br>listens not; the scriptures are lost on one that hath not his soul under<br>control; and a libation of clarified butter is lost if poured over the<br>ashes left by a fire that is extinguished. He that is endued with the<br>intelligence maketh friendships with those that are wise, having first<br>examined by the aid of his intelligence, repeatedly searching by his<br>understanding, and using his ears, eyes, and judgment. Humility removeth<br>obloquy, ears, failure, prowess; forgiveness always conquereth anger; and<br>auspicious rites destroy all indications of evil. One's lineage, O king,<br>is tested by his objects of enjoyment, place of birth, house, behaviour,<br>food, and dress. When an object of enjoyment is available, even that one<br>who hath attained emancipation is not unwilling to enjoy; what, again,<br>need be said of him that is yet wedded to desire? A king should cherish a<br>counsellor that worshippeth persons of wisdom, is endued with learning,<br>virtue, agreeable appearance, friends, sweet speech, and a good heart.<br>Whether of low or high birth, he who doth not transgress the rules of<br>polite intercourse, who hath an eye on virtue, who is endued with<br>humility and modesty, is superior to a hundred persons of high birth. The<br>friendship of those persons never cooleth, whose hearts, secret pursuits,<br>and pleasures, and acquirements, accord in every respect. He that is<br>intelligent should avoid an ignorant person of wicked soul, like a pit<br>whose mouth is covered with grass, for friendship with such a person can<br>never last. The man of wisdom should never contract friendship with those<br>that are proud, ignorant, fierce, rash and fallen off from righteousness.<br>He that is grateful, virtuous, truthful, large-hearted, and devoted, and<br>he that hath his senses under control, preserveth his dignity, and never<br>forsaketh a friend, should be desired for a friend. The withdrawal of the<br>senses from their respective objects is equivalent to death itself. Their<br>excessive indulgence again would ruin the very gods. Humility, love of<br>all creatures, forgiveness, and respect for friends,&#8212;these, the learned<br>have said, lengthen life. He who with a firm resolution striveth to<br>accomplish by a virtuous policy purposes that have once been frustrated,<br>is said to possess real manhood. That man attaineth all his objects, who<br>is conversant with remedies to be applied in the future, who is firmly<br>resolved in the present, and who could anticipate in the past how an act<br>begun would end. That which a man pursueth in word, deed, and thought,<br>winneth him for its own; therefore, one should always seek that which is<br>for his good. Effort after securing what is good, the properties of time,<br>place, and means, acquaintance with the scriptures, activity,<br>straightforwardness, and frequent meetings with those that are<br>good,&#8212;these bring about prosperity. Perseverance is the root of<br>prosperity, of gain, and of what is beneficial. The man that pursueth an<br>object with perseverance and without giving it up in vexation, is really<br>great, and enjoyeth happiness that is unending. O sire, there is nothing<br>more conducive of happiness and nothing more proper for a man of power<br>and energy as foregiveness in every place and at all times. He that is<br>weak should forgive under all circumstances. He that is possessed of<br>power should show forgiveness from motives of virtue; and he, to whom the<br>success or failure of his objects is the same, is naturally forgiving.<br>That pleasure the pursuit of which doth not injure one's virtue and<br>profit, should certainly be pursued to one's fill. One should not,<br>however, act like a fool by giving free indulgence to his senses.<br>Prosperity never resides in one who suffers himself to be tortured by a<br>grief, who is addicted to evil ways, who denies Godhead, who is idle, who<br>hath not his senses under control, and who is divested of exertion. The<br>man that is humble, and who from humility is modest is regarded as weak<br>and persecuted by persons of misdirected intelligence. Prosperity never<br>approacheth from fear the person that is excessively liberal, that giveth<br>away without measure, that is possessed of extraordinary bravery, that<br>practiseth the most rigid vows, and that is very proud of his wisdom.<br>Prosperity doth not reside in one that is highly accomplished, nor in one<br>that is without any accomplishment. She doth not desire a combination of<br>all the virtues, nor is she pleased with the total absence of all<br>virtues. Blind, like a mad cow, prosperity resides with some one who is<br>not remarkable. The fruits of the Vedas are ceremonies performed before<br>the (homa) fire; the fruits of an acquaintance with the scriptures are<br>goodness of disposition and conduct. The fruits of women are the<br>pleasures of intercourse and offspring; and the fruits of wealth are<br>enjoyment and charity. He that performeth acts tending to secure his<br>prosperity in the other world with wealth acquired sinfully, never<br>reapeth the fruits of these acts in the other world, in consequence of<br>the sinfulness of the acquisitions (spent for the purpose). In the midst<br>of deserts, or deep woods, or inaccessible fastnesses, amid all kinds of<br>dangers and alarms or in view of deadly weapons upraised for striking<br>him, he that hath strength of mind entertaineth no fear. Exertion,<br>self-control, skill, carefulness, steadiness, memory, and commencement of<br>acts after mature deliberation,&#8212;know that these are the roots of<br>prosperity. Austerities constitute the strength of ascetics; the Vedas<br>are the strength of those conversant with them; in envy lieth the<br>strength of the wicked; and in forgiveness, the strength of the virtuous.<br>These eight, viz., water, roots, fruits, milk, clarified butter (what is<br>done at) the desire of a Brahmana, (or at) the command of a preceptor,<br>and medicine, are not destructive of a vow. That which is antagonistic to<br>one's own self, should never be applied in respect of another. Briefly<br>even this is virtue. Other kinds of virtue there are, but these proceed<br>from caprice. Anger must be conquered by forgiveness; and the wicked must<br>be conquered by honesty; the miser must be conquered by liberality, and<br>falsehood must be conquered by truth. One should not place trust on a<br>woman, a swindler, an idle person, a coward, one that is fierce, one that<br>boasts of his own power, a thief, an ungrateful person, and an atheist.<br>Achievements, period of life, fame, and power&#8212;these four always expand<br>in the case of him that respectfully saluteth his superiors and waiteth<br>upon the old. Do not set thy heart after these objects which cannot be<br>acquired except by very painful exertion, or by sacrificing<br>righteousness, or by bowing down to an enemy. A man without knowledge is<br>to be pitied; an act of intercourse that is not fruitful is to be pitied;<br>the people of a kingdom that are without food are to be pitied; and a<br>kingdom without a king is to be pitied. These constitute the source of<br>pain and weakness to embodied creatures; the rains, decay of hills and<br>mountains; absence of enjoyment, anguish of women; and wordy arrows of<br>the heart. The scum of the Vedas is want of study; of Brahmanas, absence<br>of vows; of the Earth, the Vahlikas; of man, untruth; of the chaste<br>woman, curiosity; of women, exile from home. The scum of gold is silver;<br>of silver, tin; of tin, lead; and of lead, useless dross. One cannot<br>conquer sleep by lying down; women by desire; fire by fuel; and wine by<br>drinking. His life is, indeed, crowned with success who hath won his<br>friends by gifts, his foes in battle, and wife by food and drink; they<br>who have thousands live; they, who have hundreds, also live. O<br>Dhritarashtra, forsake desire. There is none who cannot manage to live by<br>some means or other. Thy paddy, wheat, gold, animals, and women that are<br>on earth all cannot satiate even one person .. Reflecting on this, they<br>that are wise never grieve for want of universal dominion. O king, I<br>again tell thee, adopt an equal conduct towards thy children, i.e.,<br>towards the sons of Pandu and thy own sons.'"
