                            "Indra said, This whole indestructible universe, O gods, hath been<br>pervaded by Vritra. There is nothing that can be equal to the task of<br>opposing him. I was capable of yore, but now I am incapable. What good<br>betide you, can I do? I believe him to be unapproachable. Powerful and<br>magnanimous, possessing immeasurable strength in fight, he would be able<br>to swallow up all the three worlds with the gods, the Asuras, and the<br>men. Therefore, hear ye dwellers of heaven, this is my resolution.<br>Proceeding to the abode of Vishnu, in company with that high-souled Being<br>must we consult, and ascertain the means of slaying this ruthless wretch.'<br><br>"Salya continued, 'Indra having thus spoken, the gods with that host of<br>Rishis repaired to the mighty god Vishnu to place themselves under<br>the-protection of that protector of all. And afflicted with the dread of<br>Vritra, they said unto the Supreme Lord of the deities. Thou hadst in<br>former times covered the three worlds with three steps. Thou hadst<br>procured the ambrosial food, O Vishnu, and destroyed the Asuras in<br>battle. Thou didst bind the great Asura Vali and hadst raised Indra to<br>the throne of heaven. Thou art the lord of the gods, and this entire<br>universe is pervaded by thee. Thou art the God, the mighty Deity, saluted<br>by all persons. Be thou the refuge of all the celestials together with<br>Indra, O best of gods. The whole universe, O slayer of Asuras, hath been<br>pervaded by Vritra. And Vishnu said, 'I am no doubt bound to do what is<br>for your good. I shall, therefore, tell you of a contrivance whereby he<br>may be annihilated. Do ye with the Rishis and the Gandharvas repair to<br>the place where Vritra that bearer of a universal form is and adopt<br>towards him a conciliatory policy. You will thus succeed in overthrowing<br>him. By virtue of my power, victory, ye gods, will be won by Indra, for,<br>remaining invisible, I shall enter into his thunderbolt, that best of<br>weapons. O foremost of gods, depart ye with the Rishis and the<br>Gandharvas. Let there be no delay in effecting a peace between Indra and<br>Vritra.'<br><br>"Salya continued, 'When he had thus spoken, the Rishis and the celestials<br>placed Indra at their head, and uniting together, went away. Approaching<br>Indra they behold Vritra glowing and resplendent as if scorching the ten<br>points, and swallowing all the three worlds, and resembling the sun or<br>the moon. And then the Rishis, came up to Vritra and spoke to him in<br>conciliatory terms, saying, 'O thou unconquerable being, the whole of<br>this universe hath been pervaded by thy energy. Thou art not able however<br>to overpower Indra, O best of mighty beings. A long period hath now<br>elapsed since you began to fight. All beings, with the gods and the<br>Asuras and men, are suffering from the effects of the fight. Let there be<br>eternal friendship between thee and Indra. Thou shalt be happy and shall<br>dwell eternally in Indra's regions.' And the mighty Vritra having heard<br>the words of the saints, bowed his head unto them. And the Asura (thus)<br>spoke, 'What you, O highly-gifted beings, and also all these Gandharvas<br>are saying, I have heard. Ye stainless beings, hear also what I have got<br>to say. How can there be peace between us two, Indra and myself? How can<br>there be friendship, ye gods, between two hostile powers?' The Rishis<br>said, 'Friendship among righteous persons happens at a single meeting. It<br>is a desirable object. Thereafter will happen what is fated to be. The<br>opportunity of forming friendship with a righteous person should not be<br>sacrificed. Therefore, the friendship of the righteous should be sought.<br>The friendship of the righteous is (like) excellent wealth, for he that<br>is wise would give advice when it is needed. The friendship of a good<br>person is of great use; therefore, a wise person should not desire to<br>kill a righteous one. Indra is honoured by the righteous, and is the<br>refuge of magnanimous persons, being veracious and unblamable, and knows<br>what virtue is, and is possessed of a refined judgment. Let there be<br>eternal friendship between thee and Indra, as described above. In this<br>way, have faith (in him); let not thy heart be differently inclined.'<br><br>"Salya said, 'Hearing these words of the great Rishis, the illustrious<br>Asura spoke to them, 'No doubt, the Rishis, endued with supernatural<br>powers, are to be respected by me. Let what I am going to say, ye gods,<br>be performed in its entirety; then I shall do everything that (these)<br>best of Brahmanas have said to me. Ye lords of the Brahmana race, ordain<br>so that Indra himself or the gods do not kill me by what is dry, or wet;<br>by stone, or by wood; by a weapon fit for close fight, or by a missile;<br>in the day time, or at night. On those terms eternal peace with Indra<br>would be acceptable to me,&#8212;Very good! was what the Rishis told him, O<br>best of Bharata race.' Thus peace having been concluded, Vritra was very<br>much pleased. And Indra also became pleased though constantly occupied<br>with the thought of killing Vritra. And the chief of the deities passed<br>his time in search of a loophole, uneasy (in mind). And on a certain day<br>when it was evening and the hour awful, Indra caught sight of the mighty<br>Asura on the coast of the sea. And he bethought himself of the boon that<br>was granted to the illustrious Asura, saying, 'This is the awful evening<br>time; it is neither day, nor night; and this Vritra, my enemy, who hath<br>stripped me of my all, must undoubtedly be killed by me. It I do not kill<br>Vritra, this great and mighty Asura of gigantic frame, even by deceit, it<br>will not go well with me.' And as Indra thought of all this, bearing<br>Vishnu in mind he beheld at that instant in the sea a mass of froth as<br>large as a hill. And he said, 'This is neither dry, nor wet, nor is it a<br>weapon; let me hurl it at Vritra. Without doubt, he will die<br>immediately.' And he threw at Vritra that mass of froth blended with the<br>thunderbolt. And Vishnu, having entered within that froth, put an end to<br>the life of Vritra. And when Vritra was killed, the cardinal points were<br>free from gloom; and there also blew a pleasant breeze; and all beings<br>were much pleased. And the deities with the Gandharvas and Yakshas and<br>Rakshasas, with the great snakes and saints, glorified the mighty Indra<br>with various laudatory hymns. And saluted by all beings, Indra spoke<br>words of encouragement to all. And his heart was glad as also that of<br>everyone of the gods for having killed the foe. And knowing the nature of<br>virtue, he worshipped Vishnu, the most praiseworthy of all objects in the<br>world. Now when the mighty Vritra, terrible to the gods, was killed,<br>Indra became overpowered by falsehood, and he became exceedingly sad; and<br>he was also overpowered by the sin of Brahmanicide on account of having<br>killed the three-headed son of Twashtri. And he betook himself to the<br>confines of the worlds, and became bereft of his senses and<br>consciousness. And overpowered by his own sins, he could not be<br>recognised. And he lay concealed in water, just like a writhing snake.<br>And when the lord of celestials, oppressed with the dread of<br>Brahmanicide, had vanished from sight, the earth looked as if a havoc had<br>passed over it. And it became treeless, and its woods withered; and the<br>course of rivers was interrupted; and the reservoirs lost all their<br>water; and there was distress among animals on account of cessation of<br>rains. And the deities and all the great Rishis were in exceeding fear;<br>and the world had no king, and was overtaken by disasters. Then the<br>deities and the divine saints in heaven, separated from the chief of the<br>gods, became terrified, and wondered who was to be their king. And nobody<br>had any inclination to act as the king of the gods.'
