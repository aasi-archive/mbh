                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing these words of Dhritarashtra, both Bhishma<br>and Drona who sympathised with the old king, again addressed disobedient<br>Duryodhana and said, 'As yet the two Krishnas are not accoutred in mail,<br>as yet Gandiva resteth inactive, as yet Dhaumya doth not consume the<br>enemy's strength by pouring libations on the war-fire, as yet that mighty<br>bowman Yudhishthira, having modesty for his ornament, doth not cast angry<br>glances on thy troops, so let hostility cease. As yet that mighty bowman,<br>Bhimasena, the son of Pritha, is not seen stationed in the midst of his<br>division, so let hostility cease. As yet Bhimasena, doth not, mace in<br>band, stalk on the field of battle, grinding (hostile) divisions, so let<br>peace be made with the Pandavas. As yet Bhima doth not, with his<br>hero-slaying mace, make the heads of warriors fighting from the backs of<br>elephants roll on the field of battle, like the palmyra-fruits in the<br>season of their ripening, so let hostility cease. As yet Nakula, and<br>Sahadeva, Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race, and Virata, and Sikhandin,<br>and Sisupal's son, accoutred in mail and all well-versed in arms, do not<br>penetrate thy ranks, like huge crocodiles penetrating the deep, and pour<br>their arrowy showers, so let hostility cease. As yet fierce-winged shafts<br>do not fall upon the delicate bodies of the assembled kings, so let<br>hostility cease. As yet fierce weapons made of iron and steel, shot<br>unerringly by mighty bowmen well-skilled in arms, endued with lightness<br>of hand and capable of hitting howsoever long distance, do not penetrate<br>the breasts of warriors, smeared with sandal and other fragrant unguents,<br>and adorned with golden garlands and gems, so let hostility cease. Let<br>that elephant among kings, Yudhishthira the Just, receive thee with an<br>embrace while thou salutest him bending thy head. O bull of Bharata's<br>race, let that king, distinguished for the liberality of his sacrificial<br>presents, place on thy shoulder that right arm of his, the palm of which<br>beareth the marks of the banner and the hook. Let him, with hands<br>begemmed and red, adorned with fingers, pat thy back while thou art<br>seated. Let the mighty-armed Vrikodara, with shoulder broad as those of<br>the sala tree, embrace thee, O bull of Bharata's race, and gently<br>converse with thee for peace. And, O king, saluted with reverence by<br>those three, viz., Arjuna and the Twins, smell thou their heads and<br>converse with them affectionately. And beholding the united with thy<br>heroic brothers&#8212;the sons of Pandu&#8212;let all these monarchs shed tears of<br>joy. Let the tidings of this cordial union be proclaimed in the cities of<br>all the kings. Let the Earth be ruled by thee with feelings of brotherly<br>affection (in thy bosom), and let thy heart be freed from the fever (of<br>jealousy and wrath).'"
