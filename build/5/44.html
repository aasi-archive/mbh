                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Excellent, O Sanat-sujata, as this thy discourse<br>is, treating of the attainment of Brahman and the origin of the universe.<br>I pray thee, O celebrated Rishi, to go on telling me words such as these,<br>that are unconnected with objects of worldly desire and are, therefore,<br>rare among men.'<br><br>"Sanat-sujata said, 'That Brahman about which thou askest me with such<br>joy is not to be attained soon. After (the senses have been restrained<br>and) the will hath been merged in the pure intellect, the state that<br>succeeds in one of utter absence of worldly thought. Even that is<br>knowledge (leading to the attainment of Brahman). It is attainable only<br>by practising Brahmacharya.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Thou sayest that the knowledge of Brahman dwelleth<br>of itself in the mind, being only discovered by Brahmacharya; that is<br>dwelling in the mind, it requires for its manifestation no efforts (such<br>as are necessary for work) being manifested (of itself) during the<br>seeking (by means of Brahmacharya). How then is the immortality<br>associated with the attainment of Brahman?'<br><br>"Sanat-sujata said, 'Though residing in and inherent to the mind, the<br>knowledge of Brahman is still unmanifest. It is by the aid of the pure<br>intellect and Brahmacharya that, that knowledge is made manifest. Indeed,<br>having attained to that knowledge, Yogins forsake this world. It is<br>always to be found among eminent preceptors. I shall now discourse to<br>thee on that knowledge.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'What should be the nature of that Brahmacharya by<br>which the knowledge of Brahman might be attained without much difficulty?<br>O regenerate one, tell me this.'<br><br>"Sanat-sujata said, 'They, who, residing in the abodes of their<br>preceptors and winning their good will and friendship, practise<br>Brahmacharya austerities, become even in this world the embodiments of<br>Brahman and casting off their bodies are united with the Supreme Soul.<br>They that in this world desirous of obtaining the state of Brahman,<br>subdue all desires, and endued as they are with righteousness, they<br>succeed in dissociating the Soul from the body like a blade projected<br>from a clump of heath. The body, O Bharata, is created by these, viz.,<br>the father and the mother; the (new) birth, however, that is due to the<br>preceptor's instructions is sacred, free from decrepitude, and immortal.<br>Discoursing upon Brahman and granting immortality, he who wraps all<br>persons with (the mantle of) truth, should be regarded as father and<br>mother; and bearing in mind the good he does, one should never do him any<br>injury. A disciple must habitually salute his preceptor with respect, and<br>with purity (of body and mind) and well-directed attention, he must<br>betake to study. He must not consider any service as mean, and must not<br>harbour anger. Even this is the first step of Brahmacharya. The practices<br>of that disciple who acquires knowledge by observing the duties ordained<br>for one of his class are regarded also as the first step of Brahmacharya.<br>A disciple should, with his very life and all his possessions, in<br>thought, word and deed, do all that is agreeable to the preceptor. This<br>is regarded as the second step of Brahmacharya. He should behave towards<br>his preceptor's wife and son also in the same way as towards his<br>preceptor himself. This also is regarded as the second step of<br>Brahmacharya. Bearing well in mind what has been done to him by the<br>preceptor, and understanding also its object, the disciple should, with a<br>delighted heart think,&#8212;I have been taught and made great by him. This is<br>the third step of Brahmacharya. Without requiring the preceptor by<br>payment of the final gift, a wise disciple must not betake to another<br>mode of life; nor should he say or even think of in his mind,&#8212;I make<br>this gift. This is the fourth step of Brahmacharya. He attaineth the<br>first step of (knowledge of Brahman which is) the object of Brahmacharya<br>by aid of time; the second step, through the preceptor's prelections; the<br>third, by the power of his own understanding; and finally, the fourth, by<br>discussion. The learned have said that Brahmacharya is constituted by the<br>twelve virtues, the Yoga-practices are called its Angas, and perseverance<br>in Yoga-meditation called is its Valam and one is crowned with success in<br>this in consequence of the preceptor's aid and the understanding of the<br>sense of the Vedas. Whatever wealth a disciple, thus engaged, may earn,<br>should all be given to the preceptor. It is thus that the preceptor<br>obtaineth his highly praise-worthy livelihood. And thus also should the<br>disciple behave towards the preceptor's son. Thus stationed (in<br>Brahmacharya), the disciple thriveth by all means in this world and<br>obtaineth numerous progeny and fame. Men also from all directions shower<br>wealth upon him; and many people come to his abode for practising<br>Brahmacharya. It is through Brahmacharya of this kind that the celestials<br>attained to their divinity, and sages, highly blessed and of great<br>wisdom, have obtained the region of Brahman. It is by this that the<br>Gandharvas and the Apsaras acquired such personal beauty, and it is<br>through Brahmacharya that Surya riseth to make the day. As the seekers of<br>the philosopher's stone derive great happiness when they obtain the<br>object of their search those mentioned above (the celestials and others),<br>on completing their Brahmacharya, derive great happiness in consequence<br>of being able to have whatever they desire. He, O king, who devoted to<br>the practice of ascetic austerities, betaketh himself to Brahmacharya in<br>its entirety and thereby purifieth his body, is truly wise, for by this<br>he becometh like a child (free from all evil passions) and triumpheth<br>over death at last. Men, O Kshatriya, by work, however, pure, obtain only<br>worlds that are perishable; he, however, that is blessed with Knowledge,<br>attaineth, by the aid of that Knowledge, to Brahman which is everlasting.<br>There is no other path (than Knowledge or the attainment of Brahman)<br>leading to emancipation.<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'The existence of Brahman, thou sayest, a wise man<br>perceiveth in his own soul. Now, is Brahman white, or red, or black or<br>blue, or purple? Tell me what is the true form and colour of the<br>Omnipresent and Eternal Brahman?'<br><br>"Sanat-sujata said, 'Indeed, Brahman as (perceived) may appear as white,<br>red, black, brown, or bright. But neither on the earth, nor in the sky,<br>nor in the water of the ocean, is there anything like it, Neither in the<br>stars, nor in lightning, nor in the clouds, is its form to be seen, nor<br>is it visible in the atmosphere, nor in the deities, nor in the moon, nor<br>in the sun. Neither in the Riks, nor among the Yajus, nor among the<br>Atharvans, nor in the pure Samans, it is to be found. Verily, O king, it<br>is not to be found in Rathantara or Varhadratha, nor in great sacrifices.<br>Incapable of being compassed and lying beyond the reach of the limited<br>intellect, even the universal Destroyer, after the Dissolution, is<br>himself lost in it. Incapable of being gazed at, it is subtle as the edge<br>of the razor, and grosser than mountains. It is the basis upon which<br>everything is founded; it is unchangeable; it is this visible universe<br>(omnipresent); it is vast; it is delightful; creatures have all sprung<br>from it and are to return to it. Free from all kinds of duality, it is<br>manifest as the universe and all-pervading. Men of learning say that it<br>is without any change, except in the language used to describe it. They<br>are emancipated that are acquainted with That in which this universe is<br>established.'"
