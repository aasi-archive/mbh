                            'Sanjaya said, 'Having listened to Uluka's words, Yudhishthira, the son<br>of Kunti, moved his army headed by Dhrishtadyumna and others. And that<br>vast army commanded by Dhrishtadyumna, consisting of four kinds of<br>forces, viz., foot-soldiers and elephants and cars and cavalry, terrible,<br>and immovable like the earth herself, and guarded by mighty car-warriors<br>led by Bhimasena and Arjuna, could be compared to the vast ocean lying in<br>stillness. And at the head of that vast force was that mighty bowman, the<br>prince of Panchalas, invincible in battle, viz., Dhrishtadyumna, desirous<br>of obtaining Drona for his antagonist. And Dhrishtadyumna began to select<br>combatants (from his own army) for pitting them against particular<br>warriors of the hostile force. And he gave orders unto his car-warriors,<br>suited to their strength and courage. And he pitted Arjuna against the<br>Suta's son (Karna), Bhima against Duryodhana, Dhrishtaketu against Salya,<br>Uttamaujas against Gautama's son (Kripa), Nakula against Kritavarman,<br>Yuyudhana against the ruler of the Sindhus (Jayadratha). And he placed<br>Sikhandin in the van, pitting him against Bhishma. And he urged Sahadeva<br>against Sakuni, and Chekitana against Sala, and the five sons of Draupadi<br>against the Trigartas. And he urged Subhadra's son (Abhimanyu) against<br>Vrishasena (the son of Karna), and also against all the rest of the<br>kings, for he regarded Abhimanyu as superior to Arjuna himself in battle.<br>And distributing his warriors thus, individually and collectively, that<br>mighty bowman, of the hue of blazing fire, kept Drona for his own share.<br>And that leader of leaders of troops, the mighty and intelligent bowman<br>Dhrishtadyumna, having arrayed his troops duly, waited for battle with a<br>firm heart. And having arrayed the combatants, as indicated above, of the<br>Pandavas, he waited, with collected mind, on the field for securing<br>victory to the sons of Pandu.'"
