                            "Bhishma said, 'Then, O chief of the Bharatas, approaching my mother,<br>that daughter of the Dasa clan, and saluting that parent of heroes, I<br>said these words,&#8212;Having vanquished all the kings, these daughters of<br>the ruler of Kasi, having beauty alone for their dowry, have been<br>abducted by me for the sake of Vichitravirya!&#8212;Then, O king, Satyavati<br>with eyes bathed in tears, smelt my head, and joyously said, 'By good<br>luck it is, O child, that thou hast triumphed!' When next, with<br>Satyavati's acquiescence, the nuptials approached, the eldest daughter of<br>the ruler of Kasi said these words in great bashfulness,&#8212;O Bhishma, thou<br>art conversant with morality, and art well-versed in all our scriptures!<br>Hearing my words, it behoveth thee to do towards me that which is<br>consistent with morality. The ruler of the Salwas was before this<br>mentally chosen by me as my lord. By him also, without my father's<br>knowledge, I was privately solicited. How wouldst thou, O Bhishma, born<br>especially as thou art in Kuru's race, transgress the laws of morality<br>and cause one that longeth for another to live in thy abode? Knowing<br>this, O bull of Bharata's race, and deliberating in thy mind, it behoveth<br>thee, O mighty-armed one, to accomplish what is proper. O monarch, it is<br>clear that the ruler of the Salwas waiteth (for me). It behoveth thee,<br>therefore, O best of the Kurus' to permit me to depart. O mighty-armed<br>one, be merciful to me, O foremost of righteous persons! Thou, O hero,<br>art devoted to truth, it is well-known all over the earth!'"
