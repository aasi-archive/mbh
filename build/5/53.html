                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Endued with great prowess and eager for victory,<br>even as the sons themselves of Pandu are, so are their followers, who are<br>all resolved to sacrifice their lives and determined to win victory. Even<br>thou, O son, hast told me of my mighty enemies, viz., the kings of the<br>Panchalas, the Kekayas, the Matsyas, and the Magadhas. He, again, who at<br>his will can bring under his subjection all the three worlds with Indra<br>at their head, even that Creator of the universe, the mighty Krishna is<br>bent on giving victory upon the Pandavas. As regards Satyaki, he acquired<br>in no time the whole science of arms from Arjuna. That scion of Sini's<br>race will stand on the battle-field, shooting his shafts like husbandmen<br>sowing seeds. The prince of Panchala, Dhristadyumna, that mighty<br>car-warrior of merciless deeds, acquainted with all superior weapons,<br>will fight with my host. Great is my fear, O child from the wrath of<br>Yudhishthira, from the prowess of Arjuna, and from the Twins and<br>Bhimasena. When those lords of men will, in the midst of my army, spread<br>their superhuman net of arrows, I fear my troops will not come out of it.<br>It is for this, O Sanjaya, that I weep. That son of Pandu, Yudhishthira,<br>is handsome, endued with great energy, highly blessed, possessed of<br>Brahma force, intelligent, of great wisdom, and virtuous soul. Having<br>allies and counsellors, united with persons ready for battle, and<br>possessing brothers and father-in-law who are all heroes and mighty<br>car-warriors, that tiger among men, the son of Pandu, is also endued with<br>patience, capable of keeping his counsels, compassionate, modest, of<br>powers incapable of being baffled, possessed of great learning, with soul<br>under proper control, ever waiting upon the aged, and subdued senses;<br>possessed thus of every accomplishment, he is like unto a blazing fire.<br>What fool, doomed to destruction and deprived of sense, will jump,<br>moth-like, into that blazing and irresistible Pandava fire! Alas, I have<br>behaved deceitfully towards him. The king, like unto a fire of long<br>flames, will destroy all my foolish sons in battle without leaving any<br>alive. I, therefore, think that it is not proper to fight with them. Ye<br>Kauravas, be ye of the same mind. Without doubt, the whole race of Kuru<br>will be destroyed, in case of hostilities being waged. This appears to me<br>very clearly, and if we act accordingly, my mind may have peace. If war<br>with them doth not seem beneficial to you, then we will strive to bring<br>about peace. Yudhishthira will never be indifferent when he sees us<br>distressed, for he censures me only as the cause of this unjust war.'"
