                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'Tell me what may be done by a person that is<br>sleepless and burning with anxieties, for thou alone amongst us, O child,<br>art versed in both religion and profit. Advise me wisely, O Vidura. O<br>thou of magnanimous heart, tell me what is thou deemest to be beneficial<br>for Ajatasatru and what is productive of good to the Kurus. Apprehending<br>future evils. I look back only on my previous guilt: I ask thee with<br>anxious heart, O learned one, tell me what is exactly in Ajatasatru's<br>mind,'<br><br>"Vidura said, 'Even if unasked, one should speak truly, whether his words<br>be good or bad, hateful or pleasing, unto him whose defeat one doth not<br>wish. I shall, therefore, say, O king, what is for the good of the Kurus.<br>I shall say what is both beneficial and consistent with morality. Listen<br>to me. Do not, O Bharata, set the heart upon means of success that are<br>unjust and improper. A man of intelligence must not grieve if any purpose<br>of his doth not succeed, notwithstanding the application of fair and<br>proper means. Before one engageth in an act, one should consider the<br>competence of the agent, the nature of the act itself, and its purpose,<br>for all acts are dependent on these. Considering these one should begin<br>an act, and not take it up on a sudden impulse. He that is wise should<br>either do an act or desist from it fully considering his own ability, the<br>nature of the act, and the consequence also of success. The king who<br>knoweth not proportion or measure as regards territory, gain, loss,<br>treasury, population, and punishment, cannot retain his kingdom long. He,<br>on the other hand, who is acquainted with the measures of these as<br>prescribed in treatises, being necessarily possessed of the knowledge of<br>religion and profit, can retain his kingdom. As the stars are affected by<br>the planets, so is this world affected by the senses, when they are<br>directed, uncontrolled, to their respective objects. Like the moon during<br>the lighted fortnight, calamities increase in respect of him who is<br>vanquished by the five senses in their natural state, which ever lead him<br>towards various acts. He who wisheth to control his counsellors before<br>controlling his own self, or to subdue his adversaries before controlling<br>his counsellors, at last succumbs deprived of strength. He, therefore,<br>who first subdueth his own self regarding it as a foe, never faileth to<br>subdue his counsellors and adversaries at last. Great prosperity waiteth<br>upon him who hath subdued his senses, or controlled his soul, or who is<br>capable of punishing all offenders, or who acteth with judgment or who is<br>blessed with patience. One's body, O king, is one's car; the soul within<br>is the driver; and the senses are its steeds. Drawn by those excellent<br>steeds, when well-trained, he that is wise, pleasantly performeth the<br>journey of life, and awake in peace. The horses that are unbroken and<br>incapable of being controlled, always lead an unskilful driver to<br>destruction in the course of the journey; so one's senses, unsubdued,<br>lead only to destruction. The inexperienced wight, who, led by this<br>unsubdued senses, hopeth to extract evil from good and good from evil,<br>necessarily confoundeth misery with happiness. He, who, forsaking<br>religion and profit, followeth the lead of his senses, loseth without<br>delay prosperity, life, wealth and wife. He, who is the master of riches<br>but not of his senses, certainly loseth his riches in consequence of his<br>want of mastery over his senses. One should seek to know one's self by<br>means of one's own self, controlling one's mind, intellect, and senses,<br>for one's self is one's friend as, indeed, it is one's own foe. That man,<br>who hath conquered self by means of self, hath his self for a friend, for<br>one's self is ever one's friend or foe. Desire and anger, O king, break<br>through wisdom, just as a large fish breaks through a net of thin cords.<br>He, who in this world regarding both religion and profit, seeketh to<br>acquire the means of success, winneth happiness, possessing all he had<br>sought. He, who, without subduing his five inner foes of mental origin,<br>wisheth to vanquish other adversaries, is, in fact, overpowered by the<br>latter. It is seen that many evil-minded kings, owing to want of mastery<br>over their senses, are ruined by acts of their own, occasioned by the<br>lust of territory. As fuel that is wet burneth with that which is dry, so<br>a sinless man is punished equally with the sinful in consequence of<br>constant association with the latter. Therefore, friendship with the<br>sinful should be avoided. He that, from ignorance, faileth to control his<br>five greedy foes, having five distinct objects, is overwhelmed by<br>calamities. Guilelessness and simplicity, purity and contentment,<br>sweetness of speech and self-restraint, truth and steadiness,&#8212;these are<br>never the attributes of the wicked. Self-knowledge and steadiness,<br>patience and devotion to virtue, competence to keep counsels and<br>charity,&#8212;these,&#8212;O Bharata, never exist in inferior men. Fools seek to<br>injure the wise by false reproaches and evil speeches, The consequence<br>is, that by this they take upon themselves the sins of the wise, while<br>the latter, freed from their sins, are forgiven. In malice lieth the<br>strength of the wicked; in criminal code, the strength of kings, in<br>attentions of the weak and of women; and in forgiveness that of the<br>virtuous. To control speech, O king, is said to be most difficult. It is<br>not easy to hold a long conversation uttering words full of meaning and<br>delightful to the hearers. Well-spoken speech is productive of many<br>beneficial results; and ill-spoken speech, O king, is the cause of evils.<br>A forest pierced by arrows, or cut down by hatchets may again grow, but<br>one's heart wounded and censured by ill-spoken words never recovereth.<br>Weapons, such as arrows, bullets, and bearded darts, can be easily<br>extracted from the body, but a wordy dagger plunged deep into the heart<br>is incapable of being taken out. Wordy arrows are shot from the mouth;<br>smitten by them one grieveth day and night. A learned man should not<br>discharge such arrows, for do they not touch the very vitals of others.<br>He, to whom the gods ordain defeat, hath his senses taken away, and it is<br>for this that he stoopeth to ignoble deeds. When the intellect becometh<br>dim and destruction is nigh, wrong, looking like right., firmly sticketh<br>to the heart. Thou dost not clearly see it, O bull of the Bharata race,<br>that clouded intellect hath now possessed thy sons in consequence of<br>their hostility to the Pandavas. Endued with every auspicious mark and<br>deserving to rule the three worlds, Yudhishthira is obedient to thy<br>commands. Let him, O Dhritarashtra, rule the earth, to the exclusion of<br>all thy sons, Yudhishthira is the foremost of all thy heirs. Endued with<br>energy and wisdom, and acquainted with the truths of religion and profit,<br>Yudhishthira, that foremost of righteous men, hath, O king of kings,<br>suffered much misery out of kindness and sympathy, in order to preserve<br>thy reputation."
