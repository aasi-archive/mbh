                            "Vaisampayana said, Dhritarashtra's son, accompanied by all the kings,<br>then addressed Bhishma, son of Santanu, and with joined hands said these<br>words, 'Without a commander, even a mighty army is routed in battle like<br>a swarm of ants. The intelligence of two persons can never agree.<br>Different commanders, again, are jealous of one another as regards their<br>prowess. O thou of great wisdom, it is heard (by us) that (once on a<br>time) the Brahmanas, raising a standard of Kusa grass, encountered in<br>battle the Kshatriyas of the Haihaya clan endued with immeasurable<br>energy. O grandsire, the Vaisyas and the Sudras followed the Brahmanas,<br>so that all the three orders were on one side, while those bulls among<br>the Kshatriyas were alone on the other. In the battles, however, that<br>ensued, the three orders repeatedly broke, while the Kshatriyas, though<br>alone, vanquished large army that was opposed to them. Then those best of<br>Brahmanas enquired of the Kshatriyas themselves (as to the cause of<br>this). O grandsire, those that were virtuous among the Kshatriyas<br>returned the true answer to the enquirers, saying, 'In battle we obey the<br>orders of one person endued with great intelligence, while ye are<br>disunited from one another and act according to your individual<br>understanding.' The Brahmanas then appointed one amongst themselves as<br>their commander, who was brave and conversant with the ways of policy.<br>And they then succeeded in vanquishing the Kshatriyas. Thus people always<br>conquer their foes in battle who appoint a skilled, brave, and sinless<br>commander, observing the good of the forces under him. As regards thee,<br>thou art equal to Usanas himself, and always seekest my good. Incapable<br>of being slain, thou art, again devoted to virtue. Be thou, therefore,<br>our commander. Like the sun among all luminaries, like the moon unto all<br>delicious herbs, like Kuvera among the Yakshas, like Vasava among the<br>gods, like Meru among mountains, Suparna among the birds, Kumara among<br>the gods, Havyavaha among Vasus, thou art amongst ourselves. Like the<br>gods protected by Sakra, ourselves, protected by thee, will assuredly<br>become invincible by the very gods. Like Agni's son (Kumara) at the head<br>of the gods, march thou at our head, and let us follow thee like calves<br>following the lead of a mighty bull.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'O mighty-armed one, it is even so, 'O Bharata, as thou<br>sayest. But the Pandavas are as dear to me as ye yourselves. Therefore, O<br>king, I should certainly seek their good as well, although I shall<br>certainly fight for thee, having given thee a pledge (before) to that<br>effect. I do not see the warrior on earth that is equal to me, except<br>that tiger among men, Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti. Endued with great<br>intelligence, he is conversant with innumerable celestial weapons. That<br>son of Pandu, however, will never fight with me openly. With the power of<br>my weapons, I can, in a trice, destroy this universe consisting of gods,<br>Asuras, Rakshasas, and human beings. The sons of Pandu, however, O king,<br>are incapable of being exterminated by me. I shall, therefore, slay every<br>day ten thousand warriors. If, indeed, they do not slay me in battle<br>first, I will continue to slaughter their forces thus. There is another<br>understanding on which I may willingly become the commander of thy<br>forces. It behoveth thee to listen to that. O lord of earth, either Karna<br>should fight first, or I will fight first. The Suta's son always boasts<br>of his prowess in battle, comparing it with mine.'<br><br>"Karna said, 'As long as Ganga's son liveth, O king, I shall never fight.<br>After Bhishma is slain, I shall fight with the wielder of Gandiva.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'After this, Dhritarashtra's son duly made<br>Bhishma the commander of his force, distributing large presents. And<br>after, his installation in the command, he blazed forth with beauty. And<br>at the king's behest, musicians cheerfully played upon drums and blew<br>conchs by hundreds and thousands. And numerous leonine roars were sent<br>forth and all the animals in the camp uttered their cries together. And<br>although the sky was cloudless, a bloody shower fell and made the ground<br>miry. And fierce whirl-winds, and earthquakes, and roars of elephants,<br>occurring, depressed the hearts of all the warriors. Incorporeal voices<br>and flashes of meteoric falls were heard and seen in the welkin. And<br>jackals, howling fiercely, foreboded great calamity. And, O monarch,<br>these and a hundred other kinds of fierce portents made their appearance<br>when the king installed Ganga's son in the command of his troops. And<br>after making Bhishma&#8212;that grinder of hostile hosts&#8212;his general, and<br>having also caused by abundant gifts of kine and gold to the Brahmanas to<br>pronounce benedictions on him, and glorified by those benedictions, and<br>surrounded by his troops, and with Ganga's son in the van, and<br>accompanied by his brothers, Duryodhana marched to Kurukshetra with his<br>large host. And the Kuru king, going over the plain with Karna in his<br>company, caused his camp to be measured out on a level part, O monarch,<br>of that plain. And the camp, pitched on a delightful and fertile spot<br>abounding with grass and fuel, shone like Hastinapura itself.'"
