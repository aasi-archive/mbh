                            "Vidura said, 'The heart of a young man, when an aged and venerable<br>person cometh to his house (as a guest), soareth aloft. By advancing<br>forward and saluting him, he getteth it back. He that is self-controlled,<br>first offering a seat, and bringing water and causing his guest's feet to<br>be washed and making the usual enquiries of welcome, should then speak of<br>his own affairs, and taking everything into consideration, offer him<br>food. The wise have said that man liveth in vain in whose dwelling a<br>Brahmana conversant with mantras doth not accept water, honey and curds,<br>and kine from fear of being unable to appropriate them, or from<br>miserliness and unwillingness with which the gifts are made. A physician,<br>a maker of arrows, even one that hath given up the vow of Brahmacharya<br>before it is complete, a thief, a crooked-minded man, a Brahmana that<br>drinks, one that causeth miscarriage, one that liveth by serving in the<br>army, and one that selleth the Vedas, when arrived as a guest, however<br>undeserving he may be the offer of water should be regarded (by a<br>householder) as exceedingly dear. A Brahmana should never be a seller of<br>salt, of cooked food, curds, milk, honey, oil, clarified butter, sesame,<br>meat, fruits, roots, potherbs, dyed clothes, all kinds of perfumery, and<br>treacle. He that never giveth way to anger, he that is above grief, he<br>that is no longer in need of friendship and quarrels, he that<br>disregardeth both praise and blame, and he that standeth aloof from both<br>what is agreeable and disagreeable, like one perfectly withdrawn from the<br>world, is a real Yogin of the Bhikshu order. That virtuous ascetic who<br>liveth on rice growing wild, or roots, or potherbs, who hath his soul<br>under control, who carefully keepeth his fire for worship, and dwelling<br>in the woods is always regardful of guests, is indeed, the foremost of<br>his brotherhood. Having wronged an intelligent person, one should never<br>gather assurance from the fact that one liveth at a distance from the<br>person wronged. Long are the arms which intelligent persons have, by<br>which they can return wrongs for wrongs done to them, One should never<br>put trust on him who should not be trusted, nor put too much trust on him<br>who should be trusted, for the danger that ariseth from one's having<br>reposed trust on another cutteth off one's very roots. One should<br>renounce envy, protect one's wives, give to others what is their due, and<br>be agreeable in speech. One should be sweet-tongued and pleasant in his<br>address as regards one's wives, but should never be their slave. It hath<br>been said that wives that are highly blessed and virtuous, worthy of<br>worship and the ornaments of their homes, are really embodiments of<br>domestic prosperity. They should, therefore, be protected particularly.<br>One should devolve the looking over of his inner apartments on his<br>father; of the kitchen, on his mother; of the kine, on somebody he looks<br>upon as his own self, but as regards agriculture, one should look over it<br>himself. One should look after guests of the trader-caste through his<br>servants, and those of the Brahmana caste through his sons. Fire hath its<br>origin in water; Kshatriyas in Brahmanas; and iron in stone. The energy<br>of those (i.e., fire, Kshatriyas, and iron) can affect all things but is<br>neutralised as soon as the things come in contact with their progenitors.<br>Fire lieth concealed in wood without showing itself externally. Good and<br>forgiving men born of high families and endued with fiery energy, do not<br>betray any outward symptoms of what is within them. That king whose<br>counsels cannot be known by either outsiders or those about him, but who<br>knoweth the counsels of others through his spies, enjoyeth his prosperity<br>long. One should never speak of what one intends to do. Let anything thou<br>doest in respect of virtue, profit, and desire, be not known till it is<br>done. Let counsels be not divulged. Ascending on the mountain-top or on<br>the terrace of a palace, or proceeding to a wilderness devoid of trees<br>and plants, one should, in secrecy, mature his counsels. O Bharata,<br>neither a friend who is without learning, nor a learned friend who hath<br>no control over his senses, deserveth to be a repository of state<br>secrets. O king, never make one thy minister without examining him well,<br>for a king's finances and the keeping of his counsels both depend on his<br>minister. That king is the foremost of rulers, whose ministers know his<br>acts in respect of virtue, profit and desire, only after they are done.<br>The king whose counsels are kept close, without doubt, commandeth<br>success. He that from ignorance committeth acts that are censurable,<br>loseth his very life in consequence of the untoward results of those<br>acts. The doing of acts that are praise-worthy is always attended with<br>ease. Omission to do such acts leadeth to repentance. As a Brahmana<br>without having studied the Vedas is not fit to officiate at a Sraddha (in<br>honour of the Pitris), so he that hath not heard of the six (means for<br>protecting a kingdom) deserveth not to take part in political<br>deliberations. O king, he that hath an eye upon increase, decrease, and<br>surplus, he that is conversant with the six means and knoweth also his<br>own self, he whose conduct is always applauded, bringeth the whole earth<br>under subjection to himself. He whose anger and joy are productive of<br>consequences, he who looketh over personally what should be done, he who<br>hath his treasury under his own control, bringeth the whole earth under<br>subjection to himself. The king should be content with the name he wins<br>and the umbrella that is held over his head. He should divide the wealth<br>of the kingdom among these that serve him. Alone he should not<br>appropriate everything. A Brahmana knoweth a Brahmana, the husband<br>understandeth the wife, the king knoweth the minister, and monarchs know<br>monarchs. A foe that deserveth death, when brought under subjection<br>should never be set free. If one be weak one should pay court to one's<br>foe that is stronger, even if the latter deserves death; but one should<br>kill that foe as soon as one commandeth sufficient strength, for, if not<br>killed, dangers soon arise from him. One should, with an effort, control<br>his wrath against the gods, kings, Brahmanas, old men, children, and<br>those that are helpless. He that is wise should avoid unprofitable<br>quarrels such as fools only engage in. By this one winneth great fame in<br>this world and avoideth misery and unhappiness. People never desire him<br>for a master whose grace is fruitless and whose wrath goest for nothing,<br>like women never desiring him for a husband who is a eunuch. Intelligence<br>doth not exist for the acquisition of wealth, nor is idleness the cause<br>of adversity; the man of wisdom only knoweth, and not others, the cause<br>of the diversities of condition in this world. The fool, O Bharata,<br>always disregardeth those that are elderly in years, and eminent in<br>conduct and knowledge, in intelligence, wealth, and lineage. Calamities<br>soon come upon them that are of wicked disposition, devoid of wisdom,<br>envious, or sinful, foul-tongued, and wrathful. Absence of deceitfulness,<br>gift, observance of the established rules of intercourse, and speech<br>well-controlled, bring all creatures under subjection. He that is without<br>deceitfulness, he that is active, grateful, intelligent, and guileless,<br>even if his treasury be empty, obtaineth friends, counsellors, and<br>servants. Intelligence, tranquillity of mind, self-control, purity,<br>absence of harsh speech and unwillingness to do anything disagreeable to<br>friends,&#8212;these seven are regarded as the fuel of prosperity's flame. The<br>wretch who doth not give to others their due, who is of wicked soul, who<br>is ungrateful, and shameless, should, O king, be avoided. The guilty<br>person who provoketh another about him that is innocent, cannot sleep<br>peacefully at night, like a person passing the night with a snake in the<br>same room. They, O Bharata, who upon being angry endanger one's<br>possessions and means of acquisition, should always be propitiated like<br>the very gods. Those objects that depend upon women, careless persons,<br>men that have fallen away from the duties of their caste, and those that<br>are wicked in disposition, are doubtful of success. They sink helplessly.<br>O king, like a raft made of stone, who have a woman, a deceitful person,<br>or a child, for their guide. They that are competent in the general<br>principles of work, though not in particular kinds of work are regarded<br>by men as learned and wise for particular kinds of work, are subsidiary,<br>That man who is highly spoken of by swindlers, mimes and women of ill<br>fame, is more dead than alive, Forsaking these mighty bowmen of<br>immeasurable energy, viz., the son of Pandu, thou hast. O Bharata,<br>devolved on Duryodhana, the cares of a mighty empire. Thou shalt,<br>therefore, soon see that swelling affluence fall off, like Vali fallen<br>off from the three worlds.'"
