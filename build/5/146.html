                            "Vaisampayana said (After Kunti had said this), Karna heard an<br>affectionate voice issued out of the solar circle. Coming from a great<br>distance, that voice was uttered by Surya himself with paternal<br>affection. (And it said)&#8212;The words said by Pritha are true. O Karna, act<br>according to the words of thy mother. O tiger among men, great good will<br>result to thee if thou fully followest those words.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Though, thus addressed by his mother, and by<br>also his father Surya himself, Karna's heart did not yet waver, for he<br>was firmly devoted to truth. And he said, 'O Kshatriya lady, I cannot<br>admit what thou hast said, viz., that obedience to thy commands<br>constituteth (in my case) the highest of my duties. O mother, I was<br>abandoned by thee as soon as I was born. This great injury, involving<br>risk to life itself, that thou didst me, hath been destructive of my<br>achievements and fame. If, indeed, I am a Kshatriya, I have, for thee,<br>been deprived of all the rites of a Kshatriya. What enemy would have done<br>me a greater injury? Without showing me mercy, when thou shouldst have<br>shown it, and having kept me divested of all the rites (that are<br>obligatory in consequence of the order of my birth), thou wouldst<br>however, lay thy command on me today! Thou hadst never before sought my<br>good as a mother should. Thou addressest me today, however, desiring to<br>do good to thyself. Who is there that would not be afraid of Dhananjaya<br>having Krishna with him (for the driver of his car)? If, therefore, I go<br>today unto the Parthas, who is there that would not regard me as doing so<br>from fright? Hitherto, nobody knew me to be their brother. If, giving out<br>on the eve of battle that I am their brother, I go to the Pandavas, what<br>would all the Kshatriyas say? Furnished with every object of desire, and<br>worshipped by them with a view to make me happy, how can I render that<br>friendship of Dhritarashtra's sons utterly futile? Having provoked<br>hostilities with others, they always wait on me respectfully, and always<br>bow down to me, as the Vasus bow down to Vasava. They think that aided by<br>my might, they are capable of encountering the foe. How can I then<br>frustrate that cherished hope of theirs? With me as their boat, they<br>desire to cross the impassable ocean of battle. How can I then abandon<br>them that are desirous of crossing that ocean which hath no other ferry?<br>This is the time when all those have been supported by Dhritarashtra's<br>sons should exert themselves for their masters. I shall certainly act for<br>them, reckless of even my life. Those sinful men of unsteady heart, who,<br>well-fed and well-furnished (with every necessary) by their masters, undo<br>the benefit received by them when the time cometh for paying back, are<br>thieves of their master's cakes, have neither this nor the other world<br>for them. I will not speak deceitfully unto thee. For the sake of<br>Dhritarashtra's son, I shall fight against thy sons to the best of my<br>strength and might. I must not, however, abandon kindness and the conduct<br>that becometh the good. Thy words, therefore, however beneficial cannot<br>be obeyed by me now. This thy solicitation to me will not yet be<br>fruitless. Except Arjuna, thy other sons, Yudhishthira, Bhima, and the<br>twins, though capable of being withstood by me in tight and capable also<br>of being slain, shall not yet be slain by me. It is with Arjuna alone,<br>among all the combatants of Yudhishthira, that I will fight. Slaying<br>Arjuna in battle, I shall achieve great merit, or slain by Savyasachin, I<br>shall be covered with glory. O famous lady, the number of thy sons will<br>never be less than five. Five it will always be,&#8212;either with me, or with<br>Arjuna, and myself slain.'<br><br>"Hearing these words of Karna, Kunti who was trembling with grief,<br>embraced her son who was unmoved in consequence of his fortitude, and<br>said, 'Indeed, O Karna, even if what thou sayest seemeth to be possible,<br>the Kauravas will certainly be exterminated. Destiny is all. Thou hast,<br>however, O grinder of foes, granted to four of thy brothers the pledge of<br>safety. Let that pledge be borne in thy remembrance at the time of<br>shooting of weapons in battle.' And having told all this, Pritha also<br>addressed Karna, saying, 'Blessed be thou, and let health be thine.' And<br>Karna replied unto her, saying, 'Be it so!' And they then left the spot,<br>wending in different directions.'"
