                            "Bhishma said, 'Issuing out of the city, Amva reflected sorrowfully in<br>this strain. 'There is not in the whole world a young woman in such a<br>miserable plight as I! Alas, destitute of friends, I am rejected by Salwa<br>also! I cannot go back to the city named after an elephant, for I was<br>permitted by Bhishma to leave that city, expectant of Salwa! Whom then<br>shall I blame? Myself? Or, the invincible Bhishma? Or, that foolish<br>father of mine who made arrangements for my self-choice? Perhaps, it is<br>my own fault! Why did I not leap down before from Bhishma's car, when<br>that fierce battle took place, for coming to Salwa? That I am so<br>afflicted now, as if deprived of my senses, is the fruit of that omission<br>of mine! Cursed be Bhishma! Cursed be my own wretched father of foolish<br>understanding, who had arranged prowess to be my dower, sending me out as<br>if I were a woman (disposed) for a consideration! Cursed be myself!<br>Cursed be king Salwa himself and cursed be my creator too! Cursed be they<br>through whose fault such great misery hath been mine! Human beings always<br>suffer what is destined for them. The cause, however, of my present<br>affliction is Bhishma, the son of Santanu; I, therefore, see that at<br>present my vengeance should fall upon him, either through ascetic<br>austerities or by battle, for he is the cause of my woe! But what king is<br>there that would venture to vanquish Bhishma in battle? Having settled<br>this, she issued out of the city for repairing to an asylum of the<br>high-souled ascetics of virtuous deeds. The night she stayed there,<br>surrounded by those ascetics. And that lady of sweet smiles told those<br>ascetics, O Bharata, all that had happened to herself with the minutest<br>details, O mighty-armed one, about her abduction, and her rejection by<br>Salwa.'<br><br>"There lived in that asylum an eminent Brahmana of rigid vows, and his<br>name was Saikhavatya. Endued with ascetic merit of a high order, he was a<br>preceptor of the scriptures and the Aranyakas. And the sage Saikhavatya,<br>of great ascetic merit, addressed that afflicted maiden, that chaste girl<br>sighing heavily in grief, and said, 'If it hath been so, O blessed lady,<br>what can high-souled ascetics residing in their (woody) retreats and<br>engaged in penances do?' That maiden, however, O king, answered him,<br>saying, 'Let mercy be shown to me; I desire a life in the woods, having<br>renounced the world. I will practise the severest of ascetic austerities.<br>All that I now suffer is certainly the fruit of those sins that I had<br>committed from ignorance in my former life. I do not venture to go back<br>to my relatives, ye ascetics, rejected and cheerless that I am knowing<br>that I have been humiliated by Salwa! Ye that have washed away your sins,<br>godlike as ye are, I desire that ye should instruct me in ascetic<br>penance! Oh, let mercy be shown to me!' Thus addressed, that sage then<br>comforted the maiden by examples and reasons borrowed from the<br>scriptures. And having consoled her thus, he promised, with the other<br>Brahmanas, to do what she desired.'"
