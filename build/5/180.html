                            "Bhishma said, 'O lord, repeatedly urged by that maiden to slay Bhishma,<br>Rama replied unto that weeping girl, saying, 'O daughter of Kasi, O thou<br>of the fairest complexion, I do not, on any account, take up arms now<br>except for the sake of those that are conversant with the Vedas. Tell me,<br>therefore, what else I can do for thee? Both Bhishma and Salwa are, O<br>princess, exceedingly obedient to me. Do not grieve, I will accomplish<br>thy object. I will not, however, O beautiful lady, take up arms, except<br>at the command of Brahmanas. This hath been my rule of conduct.'<br><br>"Amva said, 'My misery, O holy one, should by any means be dispelled by<br>thee. That misery of mine hath been caused by Bhishma. Slay him,<br>therefore, O lord, without much delay.'<br><br>"Rama said, 'O daughter of Kasi, say but the word and Bhishma, however,<br>deserving of reverence from thee, will, at my word, take up thy feet on<br>his head!'<br><br>"Amva said, 'O Rama, slay in battle that Bhishma who roareth like an<br>Asura. Indeed, summoned to the encounter (by him), slay him, O Rama, if<br>thou wishest (to do) what is agreeable to me. It behoveth thee, besides,<br>to make thy promise true.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'While, O king, Rama and Amva were talking thus with<br>each other, the Rishi (Akritavrana) of highly virtuous soul said these<br>words, 'It behoveth thee not, O mighty-armed one, to desert this girl<br>that seeketh thy protection! If summoned to battle, Bhishma cometh to the<br>encounter and sayeth&#8212;I am vanquished, or, if he obeyeth thy words, then<br>that which this maiden seeketh will be accomplished, O son of Bhrigu's<br>race, and the words spoken by thee, O hero, will also, O lord, be true!<br>This also was, O great Muni, the vow then made by thee, O Rama,&#8212;the vow<br>made by thee before Brahmanas after thou hadst conquered all the<br>Kshatriyas, viz., that thou wouldst slay in battle the person, be he a<br>Brahmana, a Kshatriya, a Vaisya, or a Sudra, who would be a foe to the<br>Brahmanas. Thou hadst further promised that as long as thou wouldst live<br>thou wouldst not abandon those that would come to thee in fright and seek<br>thy protection, and that thou wouldst, O Bhargava, slay that proud<br>warrior who would vanquish in battle all the assembled Kshatriyas of the<br>earth! O Ram, even Bhishma, that perpetuator of Kuru's race, hath<br>achieved such success (over all the Kshatriyas)! Approaching him, O son<br>of Bhrigu's race, encounter him now in battle!'<br><br>"Rama said, 'O best of Rishis, I recollect that vow of mine made before.<br>I will, however (in the present instance) do that which conciliation may<br>point out. That task which the daughter of Kasi hath in her mind is a<br>grave one, O Brahmana! Taking this maiden with me, I will repair myself<br>to the place where Bhishma is. If Bhishma, proud of his achievements in<br>battle, do not obey my behest, I will then slay that arrogant wight. Even<br>this is my fixed resolve. The arrows shot by me do not stick to the<br>bodies of embodied creatures (but pass them through). This is known to<br>you from what you saw in my encounters with the Kshatriyas!' Having said<br>this, Rama then, along with all those seekers of Brahma, resolved to<br>depart from that asylum! and the great ascetic then rose from his seat.<br>Then all those ascetics passing that night there, performed (on the next<br>morning) their homa-rites and recited their prayers. And then they all<br>set out, desirous of taking my life. And Rama, accompanied by all those<br>devotees of Brahma, then came to Kurukshetra, O monarch, with that<br>maiden, O Bharata, in their company. And those high-souled ascetics, with<br>that foremost one of Bhrigu's race at head, having arrived on the banks<br>of the stream of Saraswati, quartered themselves there.'"
