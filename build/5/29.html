                            "Krishna said, 'I desire, O Sanjaya, that the sons of Pandu may not be<br>ruined; that they may prosper, and attain their wishes. Similarly, I pray<br>for the prosperity of king Dhritarashtra whose sons are many. For<br>evermore, O Sanjaya, my desire hath been that I should tell them nothing<br>else than that peace would be acceptable to king Dhritarashtra. I also<br>deem it proper for the sons of Pandu. A peaceful disposition of an<br>exceedingly rare character hath been displayed by Pandu's son in this<br>matter. When Dhritarashtra and his sons, however, are so covetous, I do<br>not see why hostility should not run high? Thou canst not pretend, O<br>Sanjaya, to be more versed than I am or Yudhishthira. is, in the niceties<br>of right and wrong. Then why dost thou speak words of reproach with<br>reference to the conduct of Yudhishthira who is enterprising, mindful of<br>his own duty, and thoughtful, from the very beginning, of the welfare of<br>his family, agreeably to the injunctions (of treatises of morality)? With<br>regard to the topic at hand, the Brahmanas have held opinions of various<br>kinds. Some say that success in the world to come depends upon work. Some<br>declare that action should be shunned and that salvation is attainable by<br>knowledge. The Brahmanas say&#8212;that though one may have a knowledge of<br>eatable things, yet his hunger will not be appeased unless he actually<br>eats. Those branches of knowledge that help the doing of work, bear<br>fruit, but not other kinds, for the fruit of work is of ocular<br>demonstration. A thirsty person drinks water, and by that act his thirst<br>is allayed. This result proceeds, no doubt, from work. Therein lies the<br>efficacy of work. If anyone thinks that something else is better than<br>work, I deem, his work and his words are meaningless. In the other world,<br>it is by virtue of work that the gods flourish. It is by work that the<br>wind blows. It is by virtue of work that the sleepless Surya rises every<br>day and becomes the cause of day and night, and Soma passes through the<br>months and the fortnights and the combinations of constellations. Fire is<br>kindled of itself and burns by virtue of work, doing good to mankind. The<br>sleepless goddess Earth, sustains by force this very great burden. The<br>sleepless rivers, giving satisfaction to all (organised) beings, carry<br>their waters with speed. The sleepless Indra, possessed of a mighty<br>force, pours down rain, resounding the heaven and the cardinal points.<br>Desirous of being the greatest of the gods, he led a life of austerities<br>such as a holy Brahmana leads. Indra gave up pleasure, and all things<br>agreeable to the heart. He sedulously cherished virtue and truth and<br>self-control, and forbearance, and impartiality, and humanity. It was by<br>work that he attained a position the highest (of all). Following the<br>above course of life, Indra attained the high sovereignty over the gods.<br>Vrihaspati, intently and with self-control, led in a proper manner that<br>life of austerities which a Brahmana leads. He gave up pleasure and<br>controlled his senses and thereby attained the position of the preceptor<br>of the celestials. Similarly, the constellations in the other world, by<br>virtue of work, and the Rudras, the Adityas, the Vasus, king Yama, and<br>Kuvera, and the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, and the celestial nymphs, all<br>attained their present position by work. In the other world, the saints<br>shine, following a life of study, austerity and work (combined). Knowing,<br>O Sanjaya, that this is the rule followed by the best of Brahmanas, and<br>Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas, and thou being one of the wisest men,&#8212;why art<br>thou making this endeavour on behalf of those sons of Kurus? Thou must<br>know that Yudhishthira is constantly engaged in the study of the Vedas.<br>He is inclined to the horse-sacrifice and the Rajasuya. Again, he rides<br>horses and elephants, is arrayed in armour, mounts a car, and takes up<br>the bow and all kinds of weapons. Now, if the sons of Pritha can see a<br>course of action not involving the slaughter of the sons of Kuru, they<br>would adopt it. Their virtue would then be saved, and an act of religious<br>merit also would be achieved by them, even if they would have then to<br>force Bhima to follow a conduct marked by humanity. On the other hand, if<br>in doing what their forefathers did, they should meet with death under<br>inevitable destiny, then in trying their utmost to discharge their duty,<br>such death would even be worthy of praise. Supposing thou approvest of<br>peace alone I should like to hear what thou mayst have to say to this<br>question,&#8212;which way doth the injunction of religious law lie, viz.,<br>whether it is proper for the king to fight or not?&#8212;Thou must, O Sanjaya,<br>take into thy consideration the division of the four castes, and the<br>scheme of respective duties allotted to each. Thou must hear that course<br>of action the Pandavas are going to adopt. Then mayst thou praise or<br>censure, just as it may please thee. A Brahmana should study, offer<br>sacrifices, make charities, and sojourn to the best of all holy places on<br>the earth; he should teach, minister as a priest in sacrifices offered by<br>others worthy of such help, and accept gifts from persons who are known.<br>Similarly, a Kshatriya should protect the people in accordance with the<br>injunctions of the law, diligently practise the virtue of charity, offer<br>sacrifices, study the whole Veda, take a wife, and lead a virtuous<br>householder's life. If he be possessed of a virtuous soul, and if he<br>practise the holy virtues, he may easily attain the religion of the<br>Supreme Being. A Vaisya should study and diligently earn and accumulate<br>wealth by means of commerce, agriculture, and the tending of cattle. He<br>should so act as to please the Brahmanas and the Kshatriyas, be virtuous,<br>do good works, and be a householder. The following are the duties<br>declared for a Sudra from the olden times. He should serve the Brahmanas<br>and submit to them; should not study; sacrifices are forbidden to him; he<br>should be diligent and be constantly enterprising in doing all that is<br>for his good. The king protects all these with (proper) care, and sets<br>all the castes to perform their respective duties. He should not be given<br>to sensual enjoyments. He should be impartial, and treat all his subjects<br>on an equal footing. The King should never obey the dictates of such<br>desires as are opposed to righteousness. If there be any body who is more<br>praise-worthy than he, who is well-known and gifted with all the virtues,<br>the king should instruct his subjects to see him. A bad (king), however,<br>would not understand this. Growing strong, and inhuman and becoming a<br>mark for destiny's wrath, he would cast covetous eye on the riches of<br>others. Then comes war, for which purpose came into being weapons, and<br>armour, and bows. Indra invented these contrivances, for putting the<br>plunderers to death. He also contrived armours, and weapons, and bows.<br>Religious merit is acquired by putting the robbers to death. Many awful<br>evils have manifested themselves on account of the Kurus having been<br>unrighteous, and unmindful of law and religion. This is not right, O<br>Sanjaya. Now, king Dhritarashtra with his sons, hath unreasonably seized<br>what lawfully belonged to Pandu's son. He minds not the immemorial law<br>observable by kings. All the Kurus are following in the wake. A thief who<br>steals wealth unseen and one who forcibly seizes the same, in open<br>day-light, are both to be condemned, O Sanjaya. What is the difference<br>between them and Dhritarashtra's sons? From avarice he regards that to be<br>righteous which he intends to do, following the dictates of his wrath.<br>The shares of the Pandavas is, no doubt, fixed. Why should that share of<br>theirs be seized by that fool? This being the state of things, it would<br>be praiseworthy for us to be even killed in fight. A paternal kingdom is<br>preferable to sovereignty received from a stranger. These time-honoured<br>rules of law, O Sanjaya, thou must propound to the Kurus, in the midst of<br>the assembled kings,&#8212;I mean those dull-headed fools who have been<br>assembled together by Dhritarashtra's son, and who are already under the<br>clutches of death. Look once more at that vilest of all their acts,&#8212;the<br>conduct of the Kurus in the council-hall. That those Kurus, at whose head<br>stood Bhishma did not interfere when the beloved wife of the sons of<br>Pandu, daughter of Drupada, of fare fame, pure life, and conduct worthy<br>of praise, was seized, while weeping, by that slave of lust. The Kurus<br>all, including young and old, were present there. If they had then<br>prevented that indignity offered to her, then I should have been pleased<br>with Dhritarashtra's behaviour. It would have been for the final good of<br>his sons also. Dussasana forcibly took Krishna into the midst of the<br>public hall wherein were seated her fathers-in-law. Carried there,<br>expecting sympathy, she found none to take her part, except Vidura. The<br>kings uttered not a word of protest, solely because they were a set of<br>imbeciles. Vidura alone spoke words of opposition, from a sense of<br>duty,&#8212;words conceived in righteousness addressed to that man<br>(Duryodhana) of little sense. Thou didst not, O Sanjaya, then say what<br>law and morality were, but now thou comest to instruct the son of Pandu!<br>Krishna, however, having repaired to the hall at that time made<br>everything right, for like a vessel in the sea, she rescued the Pandavas<br>as also herself, from that gathering ocean (of misfortunes)! Then in that<br>hall, while Krishna stood, the charioteer's son addressed her in the<br>presence of her fathers-in-law saying, 'O Daughter of Drupada thou hast<br>no refuge. Better betake thyself as a bond-woman to the house of<br>Dhritarashtra's son. Thy husbands, being defeated, no longer exist. Thou<br>hast a loving soul, choose some one else for thy lord.' This speech,<br>proceeding from Karna, was a wordy arrow, sharp, cutting all hopes,<br>hitting the tenderest parts of the organisation, and frightful. It buried<br>itself deep in Arjuna's heart. When the sons of Pandu were about to adopt<br>the garments made of the skins of black deer, Dussasana spoke the<br>following pungent words, 'These all are mean eunuchs, ruined, and damned<br>for a lengthened time.' And Sakuni, the king of the Gandhara land, spoke<br>to Yudhishthira at the time of the game of dice the following words by<br>way of a wily trick, 'Nakula hath been won by me from you, what else have<br>you got? Now you should better stake your wife Draupadi'. You know, O<br>Sanjaya, all these words of an approbrious kind which were spoken at the<br>time of the game of dice. I desire to go personally to the Kurus, in<br>order to settle this difficult matter. If without injury to the Pandava<br>cause I succeed in bringing about this peace with the Kurus, an act of<br>religious merit, resulting in very great blessings, will then have been<br>done by me; and the Kurus also will have been extricated from the meshes<br>of death. I hope that when I shall speak to the Kurus words of wisdom,<br>resting on rules of righteousness, words fraught with sense and free from<br>all tendency to inhumanity, Dhritarashtra's son will, in my presence, pay<br>heed to them. I hope that when I arrive, the Kurus will pay me due<br>respect. Else thou mayst rest assured that those vicious sons of<br>Dhritarashtra, already scorched by their own vicious acts, will be burnt<br>up by Arjuna and Bhima ready for battle. When Pandu's sons were defeated<br>(at the play), Dhritarashtra's sons spoke to them words that were harsh<br>and rude. But when the time will come, Bhima will, no doubt, take care to<br>remind Duryodhana of those words. Duryodhana is a big tree of evil<br>passions; Karna is its trunk; Sakuni is its branches; Dussasana forms its<br>abundant blossoms and fruits; (while) the wise king Dhritarashtra is its<br>toots. Yudhishthira is a big tree of righteousness; Arjuna is its trunk;<br>and Bhima is its branches; the sons of Madri are its abundant flowers and<br>fruits; and its roots are myself and religion and religious men. King<br>Dhritarashtra with his sons constitutes a forest, while, O Sanjaya, the<br>sons of Pandu are its tigers. Do not, oh, cut down the forest with its<br>tigers, and let not the tigers be driven away from the forest. The tiger,<br>out of the woods, is easily slain; the wood also, that is without a<br>tiger, is easily cut down. Therefore, it is the tiger that protects the<br>forest and the forest that shelters the tiger. The Dhritarashtras are as<br>creepers, while, O Sanjaya, the Pandavas are Sala trees. A creeper can<br>never flourish unless it hath a large tree to twine round. The sons of<br>Pritha are ready to wait upon Dhritarashtra as, indeed, those repressors<br>of foes are ready for war. Let king Dhritarashtra now do what may be<br>proper for him to do. The virtuous and the high-souled sons of Pandu,<br>though competent to be engaged in fight, are yet now in place (with their<br>cousins). O learned man, represent all this truly (to Dhritarashtra).'"
