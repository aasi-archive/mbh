                            "Vaisampayana said, 'O smiter of foes, when Devaki's son of mighty arms<br>set out (for Hastinapura), ten mighty car-warriors, capable of slaying<br>hostile heroes, fully armed, followed in his train. And a thousand<br>foot-soldiers, and a thousand horsemen, and attendants by hundreds, also<br>formed his train, carrying, O king, provisions in abundance.'<br><br>"Janamejaya said, 'How did the illustrious slayer of Madhu, of Dasarha's<br>race, proceed on his journey? And what omens were seen when that hero set<br>out?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Listen to me as I narrate all those natural and<br>unnatural omens that were noticed at the time when the illustrious<br>Krishna departed (for Hastinapura). Though there were no clouds in the<br>sky, yet the roll of thunder accompanied by flashes of lightning was<br>heard. And fleecy clouds in a clear sky rained incessantly in the rear!<br>The seven large rivers including the Sindhu (Indus) though flowing<br>eastwards then flowed in opposite directions. The very directions seemed<br>to be reversed and nothing could be distinguished. Fires blazed up<br>everywhere, O monarch, and the earth trembled repeatedly. The contents of<br>wells and water-vessels by hundreds swelled up and ran out. The whole<br>universe was enveloped in darkness. The atmosphere being filled with<br>dust, neither the cardinal nor the subsidiary points of the horizon<br>could, O king, be distinguished. Loud roars were heard in the sky without<br>any being being visible from whom these could emanate. This wonderful<br>phenomenon, O king, was noticed all over the country. A south-westerly<br>wind, with the harsh rattle of the thunder, uprooting trees by the<br>thousands, crushed the city of Hastinapura. In those places, however, O<br>Bharata, through which he of Vrishni's race passed, delicious breezes<br>blew and everything became auspicious. Showers of lotuses and fragrant<br>flowers fell there. The very road became delightful, being free from<br>prickly grass and thorns. At those places where he stayed, Brahmanas by<br>thousands glorified that giver of wealth with (laudation) and worshipped<br>him with dishes of curds, ghee, honey, and presents of wealth. The very<br>women, coming out on the road, strewed wild flowers of great fragrance on<br>the person of that illustrious hero, devoted to the welfare of all<br>creatures. He then came upon a delightful spot called Salibhavana which<br>was filled with every kind of crops, a spot that was delicious and<br>sacred, after having, O bull of the Bharata race, seen various villages<br>abounding in bees, and picturesque to the eye, and delightful to the<br>heart, and after having passed through diverse cities and kingdoms.<br>Always cheerful and of good hearts, well-protected by the Bharatas and<br>therefore free from all anxieties on account of the designs of invaders,<br>and unacquainted with calamities of any kind, many of the citizens of<br>Upaplavya, coming out of their town, stood together on the way, desirous<br>of beholding Krishna. And beholding that illustrious one resembling a<br>blazing fire arrived at the spot, they worshipped him who deserved their<br>worship with all the honours of a guest arrived in their abode. When at<br>last that slayer of hostile heroes, Kesava, came to Vrikasthala, the sun<br>seemed to redden the sky by his straggling rays of light. Alighting from<br>his car, he duly went through the usual purificatory rites, and ordering<br>the steeds to be unharnessed, he set himself to say his evening prayers.<br>And Daruka also, setting the steeds free, tended them according to the<br>rules of equine science, and taking off the yokes and traces, let them<br>loose. After this was done, the slayer of Madhu said, 'Here must we pass<br>the night for the sake of Yudhishthira's mission. Ascertaining that to be<br>his intention, the attendants soon set a temporary abode and prepared in<br>a trice excellent food and drink. Amongst the Brahmanas, O king, that<br>resided in the village, they that were of noble and high descent, modest,<br>and obedient to the injunctions of the Vedas in their conduct, approached<br>that illustrious chastiser of foes, Hrishikesa, and honoured him with<br>their benedictions and auspicious speeches. And having honoured him of<br>Dasarha's race that deserveth honour from every one, they placed at the<br>disposal of that illustrious person their houses, abounding in wealth.<br>Saying unto them&#8212;'Enough'&#8212;the illustrious Krishna paid them proper<br>homage, each according to his rank, and wending with them to their house,<br>he returned in their company to his own (tent). And feeding all the<br>Brahmanas with sweet-meats and himself taking his meals with them, Kesava<br>passed the night happily there.'"
