                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Janardana, the chastiser of foes, after his meeting<br>with Vidura, went then in the afternoon to his paternal aunt, Pritha. And<br>beholding Krishna whose countenance beamed with the effulgence of the<br>radiant sun arrived at her abode, she encircled his neck with her arms<br>and began to pour forth her lamentations remembering her sons. And at the<br>sight, after a long time, of Govinda of Vrishni's race, the companion of<br>those mighty children of hers, the tears of Pritha flowed fast. And after<br>Krishna, that foremost of warriors, had taken his seat having first<br>received the rites of hospitality, Pritha, with a woe-begone face and<br>voice choked with tears addressed him, saying. They, who, from their<br>earliest years have always waited with reverence on their superiors;<br>they, who, in friendship are attached to one another; they, who, deprived<br>deceitfully of their kingdom had gone to seclusion, however worthy of<br>living in the midst of friends and attendants,&#8212;they, who have subjugated<br>both wrath and joy, are devoted to Brahman's, and truthful in<br>speech,&#8212;those children of mine, who, abandoning kingdom and enjoyments<br>and leaving my miserable self behind, had gone to the woods, plucking the<br>very roots of my heart,&#8212;those illustrious sons of Pandu, O Kesava, who<br>have suffered woe however undeserving of it,&#8212;how, alas, did they live in<br>the deep forest abounding with lions and tigers and elephants? Deprived<br>in their infancy of their father, they were all tenderly brought up by<br>me. How, also, did they live in the mighty forest, without seeing both<br>their parents? From their infancy, O Kesava, the Pandavas were aroused<br>from their beds by the music of conchs and drums and flutes. That they<br>who while at home, used to sleep in high palatial chambers on soft<br>blankets and skins of the Runku deer and were waked up in the morning by<br>the grunt of elephants, the neighing of steeds, the clatter of car-wheels<br>and the music of conchs and cymbals in accompaniment with the notes of<br>flutes and lyres,&#8212;who, adored at early dawn with sacred sounding hymns<br>uttered by Brahmanas, worshipped those amongst them that deserved such<br>worship with robes and jewels and ornaments, and who were blessed with<br>the auspicious benedictions of those illustrious members of the<br>regenerate order, as a return for the homage the latter received,&#8212;that<br>they, O Janardana, could sleep in the deep woods resounding with the<br>shrill and dissonant cries of beasts of prey can hardly be believed,<br>undeserving as they were of so much woe. How could they, O slayer of<br>Madhu, who were roused from their beds by music of cymbals and drums and<br>conchs and flutes, with the honeyed strains of songstresses and the<br>eulogies chanted by bards and professional reciters,&#8212;alas, how could<br>they be waked in the deep woods by the yells of wild beasts? He that is<br>endued with modesty, is firm in truth, with senses under control and<br>compassions for all creatures,&#8212;he that hath vanquished both lust and<br>malice and always treadeth the path of the righteous, he that ably bore<br>the heavy burthen borne by Amvarisha and Mandhatri Yayati and Nahusha and<br>Bharata and Dilip and Sivi the son of Usinara and other royal sages of<br>old, he that is endued with an excellent character and disposition, he<br>that is conversant with virtue, and whose prowess is incapable of being<br>baffled, he that is fit to become the monarch of the three worlds in<br>consequence of his possession of every accomplishment, he that is the<br>foremost of all the Kurus lawfully and in respect of learning and<br>disposition, who is handsome and mighty-armed and hath no enemy,&#8212;Oh, how<br>is that Yudhishthira of virtuous soul, and of complexion like that of<br>pure gold? He that hath the strength of ten thousand elephants and the<br>speed of the wind, he that is mighty and ever wrathful amongst the sons<br>of Pandu, he that always doth good to his brothers and is, therefore,<br>dear to them all, he, O slayer of Madhu, that slew Kichaka with all his<br>relatives, he that is the slayer of the Krodhavasas, of Hidimva, and of<br>Vaka, he that in prowess is equal unto Sakra, and in might unto the<br>Wind-god, he that is terrible, and in wrath is equal unto Madhava<br>himself, he that is the foremost of all smiters,&#8212;that wrathful son of<br>Pandu and chastiser of foes, who, restraining his rage, might,<br>impatience, and controlling his soul, is obedient to the commands of his<br>elder brother,&#8212;speak to me, O Janardana, tell me how is that smiter of<br>immeasurable valour, that Bhimasena, who in aspect also justifies his<br>name&#8212;that Vrikodara possessing arms like maces, that mighty second son<br>of Pandu? O Krishna, that Arjuna of two arms who always regardeth himself<br>as superior to his namesake of old with thousand arms, and who at one<br>stretch shooteth five hundred arrows, that son of Pandu who in the use of<br>weapons is equal unto king Kartavirya, in energy unto Aditya, in<br>restraint of senses unto a great sage, in forgiveness unto the Earth, and<br>in prowess unto Indra himself,&#8212;he, by whose prowess, O slayer of Madhu,<br>the Kurus amongst all the kings of the earth have obtained this extensive<br>empire, blazing with effulgence,&#8212;he, whose strength of arms is always<br>adored by the Pandavas,&#8212;that son of Pandu, who is the foremost of all<br>car-warriors and whose prowess is incapable of being frustrated,&#8212;he,<br>from an encounter with whom in battle no foe ever escapeth with<br>life,&#8212;he, O Achyuta, who is the conqueror of all, but who is incapable<br>of being conquered by any,&#8212;he, who is the refuge of the Pandavas like<br>Vasava of the celestials,&#8212;how, O Kesava, is that Dhananjaya now, that<br>brother and friend of thine? He that is compassionate to all creatures,<br>is endued with modesty and acquainted with mighty weapons, is soft and<br>delicate and virtuous,&#8212;he that is dear to me,&#8212;that mighty bowman<br>Sahadeva, that hero and ornament of assemblies,&#8212;he, O Krishna, who is<br>youthful in years, is devoted to the service of his brothers, and is<br>conversant with both virtue and profit, whose brothers, O slayer of<br>Madhu, always applaud the disposition of that high-souled and<br>well-behaved son of mine,&#8212;tell me, O thou of the Vrishni race, of that<br>heroic Sahadeva, that foremost of warriors, that son of Madri, who always<br>waiteth submissively on his elder brothers and so reverentially on me. He<br>that is delicate and youthful in years, he that is brave and handsome in<br>person,&#8212;that son of Pandu who is dear unto his brothers as also unto<br>all, and who, indeed, is their very life though walking with a separate<br>body,&#8212;he that is conversant with various modes of warfare,&#8212;he that is<br>endued with great strength and is a mighty bowman,&#8212;tell me, O Krishna,<br>whether that dear child of mine, Nakula, who was brought up in luxury, is<br>now well in body and mind? O thou of mighty arms, shall I ever behold<br>again Nakula of mine, that mighty car-warrior, that delicate youth<br>brought up in every luxury and undeserving of woe? Behold, O hero, I am<br>alive today, even I, who could know peace by losing sight of Nakula for<br>the short space of time taken up by a wink of the eye. More than all my<br>sons, O Janardana, is the daughter of Drupada dear to me. High-born and<br>possessed of great beauty, she is endued with every accomplishment.<br>Truthful in speech, she chose the company of her lords, giving up that of<br>her sons, Indeed, leaving her dear children behind, she followeth the<br>sons of Pandu. Waited upon at one time by a large train of servants, and<br>adored by her husbands with every object of enjoyment, the possessor of<br>every auspicious mark and accomplishment, how, O Achyuta, is that<br>Draupadi now? Having five heroic husbands who are all smiters of foes and<br>all mighty bowmen, each equal unto Agni in energy, alas, woe hath yet<br>been the lot of Drupada's daughter. I have not for fourteen long years, O<br>chastiser of foes, beheld the princess of Panchala, that daughter-in-law<br>of mine' who herself hath been a prey to constant anxiety on account of<br>her children, whom she hath not seen for that period. When Drupada's<br>daughter endued with such a disposition, doth not enjoy uninterrupted<br>happiness, it seemeth, O Govinda, that the happiness one enjoyeth is<br>never the fruit of one's acts. When I remember the forcible dragging of<br>Draupadi to the assembly, then neither Vibhatsu nor Yudhishthira, nor<br>Bhima, nor Nakula, nor Sahadeva, becometh an object of affection to me.<br>Never before had a heavier grief been mine than what pierced my heart<br>when that wretch Dussasana, moved by wrath and covetousness, dragged<br>Draupadi, then in her flow, and therefore clad in a single raiment, into<br>the presence of her father-in-law in the assembly and exposed her to the<br>gaze of all the Kurus. It is known that amongst those that were present,<br>king Vahlika, Kripa, Somadatta, were pierced with grief at this sight,<br>but of all present in that assembly, it was Vidura whom I worship.<br>Neither by learning, nor by wealth doth one become worthy of homage. It<br>is by disposition alone that one becomes respectable, O Krishna, endued<br>with great intelligence and profound wisdom, the character of the<br>illustrious Vidura, like unto an ornament (that he wears) adorns the<br>whole world.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Filled with delight at the advent of Govinda,<br>and afflicted with sorrow (on account of her sons) Pritha gave expression<br>to all her diverse griefs. And she said, 'Can gambling and the slaughter<br>of deer, which, O chastiser of foes, occupied all wicked kings of old, be<br>a pleasant occupation for the Pandavas? The thought consumeth, O Kesava,<br>that being dragged into the presence of all the Kurus in their assembly<br>by Dhritarashtra's sons, insults worse than death were heaped on Krishna,<br>O chastiser of foes, the banishment of my sons from their capital and<br>their wanderings in the wilderness,&#8212;these and various other griefs, O<br>Janardana, have been mine. Nothing could be more painful to me or to my<br>sons themselves, O Madhava, than that they should have had to pass a<br>period of concealment, shut up in a stranger's house. Full fourteen years<br>have passed since the day when Duryodhana first exited my sons. If misery<br>is destructive of fruits of sins, and happiness is dependent on the<br>fruits of religious merit, then it seems that happiness may still be ours<br>after so much misery. I never made any distinction between<br>Dhritarashtra's sons and mine (so far as maternal affection is<br>concerned). By that truth, O Krishna, I shall surely behold thee along<br>with the Pandavas safely come out of the present strife with their foes<br>slain, and the kingdom recovered by them. The Pandavas themselves have<br>observed their vow with such truthfulness sticking to Dharma that they<br>are incapable of being defeated by their enemies. In the matter of my<br>present sorrows, however, I blame neither myself nor Suyodhana, but my<br>father alone. Like a wealthy man giving away a sum of money in gift, my<br>father gave me away to Kuntibhoja. While a child playing with a ball in<br>my hands, thy grandfather, O Kesava, gave me away to his friend, the<br>illustrious Kuntibhoja. Abandoned, O chastiser of foes, by my own father,<br>and my father-in law, and afflicted with insufferable woes, what use, O<br>Madhava, is there in my being alive? On the night of Savyasachin's birth,<br>in the lying-in-room, an invisible voice told me, 'This son of thine will<br>conquer the whole world, and his fame will reach the very heavens.<br>Slaying the Kurus in a great battle and recovering the kingdom, thy son<br>Dhanajaya will, with his brothers, perform three grand sacrifices.' I do<br>not doubt the truth of that announcement. I bow unto Dharma that upholds<br>the creation. If Dharma be not a myth, then, O Krishna, thou wilt surely<br>achieve all that the invisible voice said. Neither the loss of my<br>husband, O Madhava, nor loss of wealth, nor our hostility with the Kurus<br>ever inflicted such rending pains on me as that separation from my<br>children. What peace can my heart know when I do not see before me that<br>wielder of Gandiva, viz., Dhananjaya, that foremost of all bearers of<br>arms? I have not, for fourteen years, O Govinda, seen Yudhishthira, and<br>Dhananjaya, and Vrikodara. Men perform the obsequies of those that are<br>missed for a long time, taking them for dead. Practically, O Janardana,<br>my children are all dead to me and I am dead to them.<br><br>'Say unto the virtuous king Yudhishthira, O Madhava, that-Thy virtue, O<br>son, is daily decreasing. Act thou, therefore, in such a way that thy<br>religious merit may not diminish. Fie to them that live, O Janardana, by<br>dependence on others. Even death is better than a livelihood gained by<br>meanness. Thou must also say unto Dhananjaya and the ever-ready Vrikodara<br>that&#8212;The time for that event is come in view of which a Kshatriya woman<br>bringeth forth a son. If you allow the time slip without your achieving<br>anything, then, though at present ye are respected by all the world, ye<br>will be only doing that which would be regarded as contemptible. And if<br>contempt touches you, I will abandon you for ever. When the time cometh,<br>even life, which is so dear, should be laid down, O foremost of men, thou<br>must also say unto Madri's sons that are always devoted to Kshatriya<br>customs.&#8212;More than life itself, strive ye to win objects of enjoyment,<br>procurable by prowess, since objects won by prowess alone can please the<br>heart of a person desirous of living according to Kshatriya customs.<br>Repairing thither, O mighty-armed one, say unto that foremost of all<br>bearers of arms, Arjuna the heroic son of Pandu,&#8212;Tread thou the path<br>that may be pointed out to thee by Draupadi. It is known to thee, O<br>Kesava, that when inflamed with rage, Bhima and Arjuna, each like unto<br>the universal Destroyer himself, can slay the very gods. That was a great<br>insult offered unto them, viz., that their wife Krishna, having been<br>dragged into the assembly was addressed in such humiliating terms by<br>Dussasana and Karna. Duryodhana himself hath insulted Bhima of mighty<br>energy in the very presence of the Kuru chiefs. I am sure he will reap<br>the fruit of that behaviour, for Vrikodara, provoked by a foe, knoweth no<br>peace. Indeed, once provoked, Bhima forgets it not for a long while, even<br>until that grinder of foes exterminates the enemy and his allies. The<br>loss of kingdom did not grieve me; the defeat at dice did not grieve me.<br>That the illustrious and beautiful princess of Panchala was dragged into<br>the assembly while clad in a single raiment and made to hear bitter words<br>grieved me most. What, O Krishna, could be a greater grief to me? Alas,<br>ever devoted to Kshatriya customs and endued with great beauty, the<br>princess, while ill, underwent that cruel treatment, and though<br>possessing powerful protectors was then as helpless as if she had none. O<br>slayer of Madhu, having thee and that foremost of all mighty persons,<br>Rama, and that mighty car-warrior Pradyumna for me and my children's<br>protectors and having, O foremost of men, my sons the invincible Bhima<br>and the unretreating Vijaya both alive, that I had still such grief to<br>bear is certainly strange!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by her, Sauri the friend of<br>Partha, then comforted his paternal aunt, Pritha, afflicted with grief on<br>account of her sons. And Vasudeva said, 'What woman is there, O aunt, in<br>the world who is like thee? The daughter of king Surasena, thou art, by<br>marriage, admitted into Ajamida's race. High-born and highly married,<br>thou art like a lotus transplanted from one mighty lake into another.<br>Endued with every prosperity and great good fortune, thou wert adored by<br>thy husband. The wife of hero, thou hast again given birth to heroic<br>sons. Possessed of every virtue, and endued with great wisdom, it<br>behoveth thee to bear with patience, both happiness and misery.<br>Overcoming sleep and langour, and wrath and joy, and hunger and thirst,<br>and cold and heat, thy children are always in the enjoyment of that<br>happiness, which, as heroes, should by theirs. Endued with great exertion<br>and great might, thy sons, without affecting the comforts derivable from<br>the senses such as satisfy only the low and the mean, always pursue that<br>happiness which as heroes they should. Nor are they satisfied like little<br>men having mean desires. They that are wise enjoy or suffer the same of<br>whatever enjoyable or sufferable, Indeed, ordinary persons, affecting<br>comforts that satisfy the low and the mean, desire an equable state of<br>dullness, without excitement of any kind. They, however, that are<br>superior, desire either the acutest of human suffering or the highest of<br>all enjoyments that is given to man. The wise always delight in extremes.<br>They find no pleasure betwixt; they regard the extreme to be happiness,<br>while that which lies between is regarded by them as misery. The Pandavas<br>with Krishna saluteth thee through me. Representing themselves to be<br>well, they have enquired after thy welfare. Thou wilt soon behold them<br>become the lords of the whole world, with their foe slain, and themselves<br>invested with prosperity.'<br><br>'Thus consoled by Krishna, Kunti, afflicted with grief on account of her<br>sons, but soon dispelling the darkness caused by her temporary loss of<br>understanding, replied unto Janardana, saying, 'Whatever, O mighty-armed<br>one, thou, O slayer of Madhu, regardest as proper to be done, let that be<br>done without sacrificing righteousness, O chastiser of foes, and without<br>the least guile. I know, O Krishna, what the power of thy truth and of<br>thy lineage is. I know also what judgment and what prowess thou bringest<br>to bear upon the accomplishment of whatever concerns thy friends. In our<br>race, thou art Virtue's self, thou art Truth, and thou art the embodiment<br>of ascetic austerities. Thou art the great Brahma, and everything rests<br>on thee. What, therefore, thou hast said must be true.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Bidding her farewell and respectfully walking<br>round her, the mighty-armed Govinda then departed for Duryodhana's<br>mansion.'"
