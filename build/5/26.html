                            "Yudhishthira said, 'What words from me, O Sanjaya, hast thou heard,<br>indicative of war, that thou apprehendest war? O sire, peace is<br>preferable to war. Who, O charioteer, having got the other alternative<br>would wish to fight? It is known to me, O Sanjaya, that if a man can have<br>every wish of his heart without having to do anything, he would hardly<br>like to do anything even though it might be of the least troublesome<br>kind, far less would he engage in war. Why should a man ever go to war?<br>Who is so cursed by the gods that he would select war? The sons of<br>Pritha, no doubt, desire their own happiness but their conduct is ever<br>marked by righteousness and conducive to the good of the world. They<br>desire only that happiness which results from righteousness. He that<br>fondly followeth the lead of his senses, and is desirous of obtaining<br>happiness and avoiding misery, betaketh himself to action which in its<br>essence is nothing but misery. He that hankers after pleasure causeth his<br>body to suffer; one free from such hankering knoweth not what misery is.<br>As an enkindled fire, if more fuel be put upon it, blazeth forth again<br>with augmented force, so desire is never satiated with the acquisition of<br>its object but gaineth force like unkindled fire when clarified butter is<br>poured upon it. Compare all this abundant fund of enjoyment which king<br>Dhritarashtra hath with what we possess. He that is unfortunate never<br>winneth victories. He that is unfortunate enjoyeth not the voice of<br>music. He that is unfortunate doth not enjoy garlands and scents! nor can<br>one that is unfortunate enjoy cool and fragrant unguents! and finally he<br>that is unfortunate weareth not fine clothes. If this were not so, we<br>would never have been driven from the Kurus. Although, however, all this<br>is true, yet none cherished torments of the heart. The king being himself<br>in trouble seeketh protection in the might of others. This is not wise.<br>Let him, however, receive from others the same behaviour that he displays<br>towards them. The man who casteth a burning fire at midday in the season<br>of spring in a forest of dense underwood, hath certainly, when that fire<br>blazeth forth by aid of the wind, to grieve for his lot if he wisheth to<br>escape. O Sanjaya, why doth king Dhritarashtra now bewail, although he<br>hath all this prosperity? It is because he had followed at first the<br>counsels of his wicked son of vicious soul, addicted to crooked ways and<br>confirmed in folly. Duryodhana disregarded the words of Vidura, the best<br>of his well-wishers, as if the latter were hostile to him. King<br>Dhritarashtra, desirous solely of satisfying his sons, would knowingly<br>enter upon an unrighteous course. Indeed, on account of his fondness for<br>his son, he would not pay heed to Vidura, who, out of all the Kurus, is<br>the wisest and best of all his well-wishers, possessing vast learning,<br>clever in speech, and righteous in act. King Dhritarashtra is desirous of<br>satisfying his son, who, while himself seeking honours from others, is<br>envious and wrathful, who transgresses the rules for the acquisition of<br>virtue and wealth, whose tongue is foul, who always follows the dictates<br>of his wrath, whose soul is absorbed in sensual pleasures, and who, full<br>of unfriendly feelings to many, obeys no law, and whose life is evil,<br>heart implacable, and understanding vicious. For such a son as this, king<br>Dhritarashtra knowingly abandoned virtue and pleasure. Even then, O<br>Sanjaya, when I was engaged in that game of dice I thought that the<br>destruction of the Kurus was at hand, for when speaking those wise and<br>excellent words Vidura obtained no praise from Dhritarashtra. Then, O<br>charioteer, did trouble overtake the Kurus when they disregarded the<br>words of Vidura. So long as they had placed themselves under the lead of<br>his wisdom, their kingdom was in a flourishing state. Hear from me, O<br>charioteer, who are the counsellors now of the covetous Duryodhana. They<br>are Dussasana, and Sakuni the son of Suvala, and Karna the Suta's son! O<br>son of Gavalgana, look at this folly of his! So I do not see, though I<br>think about it, how there can be prosperity for the Kurus and the<br>Srinjayas when Dhritarashtra hath taken the throne from others, and the<br>far seeing Vidura hath been banished elsewhere. Dhritarashtra with his<br>sons is now looking for an extensive and undisputed sovereignty over the<br>whole world. Absolute peace is, therefore, unattainable. He regardeth<br>what he hath already got to be his own. When Arjuna taketh up his weapon<br>in fight, Karna believeth him capable of being withstood. Formerly there<br>took place many great battles. Why could not Karna then be of any avail<br>to them. It is known to Karna and Drona and the grandsire Bhishma, as<br>also to many other Kurus, that there is no wielder of the bow, comparable<br>to Arjuna. It is known to all the assembled rulers of the earth, how the<br>sovereignty was obtained by Duryodhana although that repressor of foes,<br>Arjuna, was alive. Pertinanciously doth Dhritarashtra's son believe that<br>it is possible to rob the sons of Pandu of what is their own, although he<br>knoweth having himself gone to the place of fight, how Arjuna comforted<br>himself when he had nothing but a bow four cubits long for his weapon of<br>battle. Dhritarashtra's sons are alive simply because they have not as<br>yet heard that twang of the stretch Gandiva. Duryodhana believeth his<br>object already gained, as long as he beholdeth not the wrathful Bhima. O<br>sire, even Indra would forbear to rob us of our sovereignty as long as<br>Bhima and Arjuna and the heroic Nakula and the patient Sahadeva are<br>alive! O charioteer, the old king with his son still entertains the<br>notion that his sons will not be perished, O Sanjaya, on the field of<br>battle, consumed by the fiery wrath of Pandu's sons. Thou knowest, O<br>Sanjaya, what misery we have suffered! For my respect to thee, I would<br>forgive them all. Thou knowest what transpired between ourselves and<br>those sons of Kuru. Thou knowest how we comforted ourselves towards<br>Dhritarashtra's son. Let the same state of things still continue, I shall<br>seek peace, as thou counsellest me to do. Let me have Indraprastha for my<br>kingdom, Let this be given to me by Duryodhana, the chief of Bharata's<br>race.'"
