                            Dhritarashtra said, 'Tell me, O thou of great wisdom, what high-souled<br>Vasudeva and Dhananjaya said. I am anxious to hear from thee all about<br>this.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Listen, O king, as I tell thee the state in which I found<br>Krishna and Dhananjaya. I will also, O Bharata, tell thee what those<br>heroes said; O king, with looks bent down and hands joined together, and<br>with senses well restrained, I entered the inner apartments for<br>conferring with those gods among men. Neither Abhimanyu nor the Twins can<br>repair to that place where are the two Krishnas and Draupadi and lady<br>Satyabhama. There I beheld those chastisers of foes, exhilarated with<br>Bassia wine, their bodies adorned with garlands of flowers. Attired in<br>excellent robes and adorned with celestial ornaments, they sat on a<br>golden dais, decked with numerous gems, and covered over with carpets of<br>diverse texture and hue. And I beheld Kesava's feet resting upon Arjuna's<br>lap while those of the high-souled Arjuna rested upon the laps of Krishna<br>and Satyabhama. Partha then pointed out to me (for a seat) a foot-stool<br>made of gold. Touching it with my hand, I seated myself down on the<br>ground. And when he withdraw his feet from the foot-stool, I beheld<br>auspicious marks on both his soles. Those consisted of two longitudinal<br>lines running from heels to fore-toe, O sire, endued with black<br>complexions, of high statures, and erect like Sala trunks, beholding<br>those youthful heroes, both seated on the same seat, a great fear seized<br>me. They seemed to me to be Indra and Vishnu seated together, though<br>Duryodhana of dull sense knoweth it no consequence of his reliance on<br>Drona and Bhishma and on the loud vaunts of Karna. That very moment, I<br>was convinced that the wishes of Yudhishthira the just, who had those two<br>for obeying his orders, were certain to succeed. Being hospitably<br>entertained with food and drink, and honoured with other courtesies, I<br>conveyed to them thy message, placing my joined hands on my head. Then<br>Partha, removing Kesava's auspicious foot from his lap, with his hand<br>scarred by the flappings of the bow-string, urged him to speak. Sitting<br>up erect like Indra's banner, adorned with every ornament, and resembling<br>Indra himself in energy, Krishna then addressed me. And the words which<br>that best of speakers said were sweet, charming and mild, though awful<br>and alarming to the son of Dhritarashtra. Indeed, the words uttered by<br>Krishna, who alone is fit to speak, were of correct emphasis and accent,<br>and pregnant with meaning, though heart-rending in the end. And Vasudeva<br>said, 'O Sanjaya, say thou these words unto the wise Dhritarashtra and in<br>the hearing of that foremost of the Kurus, Bhishma, and also of Drona,<br>having first saluted at our request, O Suta, all the aged ones and hawing<br>enquired after the welfare of the younger ones, 'Do ye celebrate diverse<br>sacrifices, making presents unto the Brahmanas, and rejoice with your<br>sons and wives, for a great danger threatens ye? Do ye give away wealth<br>unto deserving persons, beget desirable sons, and do agreeable offices to<br>those that are dear to thee, for king Yudhishthira is eager for victory?'<br>While I was at a distance, Krishna with tears addressing me said, 'That<br>debt, accumulating with time, hath not yet been paid off by me. Ye have<br>provoked hostilities with that Savyasachin, who hath for his bow the<br>invincible Gandiva, of fiery energy, and who hath me for his helpmate.<br>Who, even if he were Purandara himself, would challenge Partha having me<br>for his help-mate, unless, of course, his span of life were full? He that<br>is capable of vanquishing Arjuna in battle is, indeed, able to uphold the<br>Earth with his two arms, to consume all created things in anger and hurl<br>the celestials from Heaven. Among the celestials, Asuras, and men, among<br>Yakshas, Gandharvas, and Nagas, I do not find the person that can<br>encounter Arjuna in battle. That wonderful story which is heard of an<br>encounter in the city of Virata between a single person on one side and<br>innumerable warriors on the other, is sufficient proof of this. That ye<br>all fled in all directions being routed in the city of Virata by that son<br>of Pandu singly, is sufficient proof of this. Might, prowess, energy,<br>speed, lightness of hand, indefatiguableness, and patience are not to be<br>found in any one else save Partha.' Thus spoke Hrishikesa cheering up<br>Partha by his words and roaring like rain-charged clouds in the<br>firmament. Having heard these words of Kesava, the diadem-decked Arjuna,<br>of white steeds, also spoke to the same effect.'"
