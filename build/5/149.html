                            "Vasudeva said, 'After Gandhari had said this, that ruler of men,<br>Dhritarashtra, then said these words to Duryodhana in the midst of the<br>(assembled) monarchs, 'O Duryodhana, listen, O son, to what I say, and<br>blessed be thou; do that if thou hast any respect for thy father. The<br>lord of creatures, Soma, was the original progenitor of the Kuru race.<br>Sixth in descent from Soma, was Yayati, the son of Nahusha. Yayati had<br>five best of royal sages as his sons. Amongst them, lord Yadu of mighty<br>energy was the eldest-born. Younger to Yadu was Puru, who, as our<br>progenitor, brought forth by Sarmistha the daughter of Vrishaparvan.<br>Yadu, O best of the Bharatas, was born of Devayani and, therefore, O<br>sire, was the daughter's son of Sukra, otherwise called Kavya, of<br>immeasurable energy. Endued with great strength and prowess, that<br>progenitor of the Yadavas, filled with pride and possessed of wicked<br>understanding, humiliated all the Kshatriyas. Intoxicated with pride of<br>strength, he obeyed not the injunctions of his father. Invincible in<br>battle, he insulted his father and brother. On this earth girt on four<br>sides by the sea, Yadu became all-powerful, and reducing all to<br>subjection, he established himself in this city called after the<br>elephant. His father Yayati, the son of Nahusha, enraged with him, cursed<br>that son of his, and, O son of Gandhari, even expelled him from the<br>kingdom. Angry Yayati also cursed those brothers of Yadu who were<br>obedient to that eldest brother of theirs, who was so proud of his<br>strength. And having cursed his these sons, that best of kings placed on<br>his throne his youngest son Puru who was docile and obedient to him. Thus<br>even the eldest son may be passed over and deprived of the kingdom, and<br>younger sons may, in consequence of their respectful behaviour to the<br>aged, obtain the kingdom. So also, conversant with every virtue there was<br>my father's grandfather, king Pratipa, who was celebrated over the three<br>worlds. Unto that lion among kings, who ruled his kingdom virtuously were<br>born three sons of great fame and resembling three gods. Of them, Devapi<br>was the eldest, Vahlika the next and Santanu of great intelligence, who,<br>O sire, was my grandfather, was the youngest. Devapi, endued with great<br>energy, was virtuous, truthful in speech, and ever engaged in waiting<br>upon his father. But that best of kings had a skin-disease. Popular with<br>both the citizens and the subjects of the provinces, respected by the<br>good, and dearly loved by the young and the old, Devapi was liberal<br>firmly adhering to truth, engaged in the good of all creatures, and<br>obedient to the instructions of his father as also of the Brahmanas. He<br>was dearly loved by his brother Vahlika as also the high-souled Santanu.<br>Great, indeed, was the brotherly love that prevailed between him and his<br>high-souled brothers. In course of time, the old and best of kings,<br>Pratipa, caused all preparations to be made according to the scriptures<br>for the installation of Devapi (on the throne). Indeed, the lord Pratipa<br>caused every auspicious preparation. The installation of Devapi, however,<br>was forbidden by the Brahmanas and all aged persons amongst the citizens<br>and the inhabitants of the provinces. Hearing that the installation of<br>his son was forbidden, the voice of the old king became choked with tears<br>and he began to grieve for his son. Thus, though Devapi was liberal,<br>virtuous, devoted to truth, and loved by the subjects, yet in consequence<br>of his skin-disease, he was excluded from his inheritance. The gods do<br>not approve of a king that is defective of a limb. Thinking of this,<br>those bulls among Brahmanas forbade king Pratipa to install his eldest<br>son. Devapi then, who was defective of one limb, beholding the king (his<br>father) prevented (from installing him on the throne) and filled with<br>sorrow on his account, retired into the woods. As regards Vahlika,<br>abandoning his (paternal) kingdom he dwelt with his maternal uncle.<br>Abandoning his father and brother, he obtained the highly wealthy kingdom<br>of his maternal grandfather. With Vahlika's permission, O prince, Santanu<br>of world-wide fame, on the death of his father (Pratipa), became king and<br>ruled the kingdom. In this way also, O Bharata, though I am the eldest,<br>yet being defective of a limb, I was excluded from the kingdom by<br>intelligent Pandu, no doubt, after much reflection. And Pandu himself,<br>though younger to me in age, obtained the kingdom and became king. At his<br>death, O chastiser of foes, that kingdom must pass to his sons. When I<br>could not obtain the kingdom, how canst thou covet it? Thou art not the<br>son of a king, and, therefore, hast no right to this kingdom. Thou,<br>however, desirest to appropriate the property of others. High-souled<br>Yudhishthira is the son of a king. This kingdom is lawfully his. Of<br>magnanimous soul, even he is the ruler and lord of this race of Kuru. He<br>is devoted to truth, of clear perception, obedient to the counsels of<br>friends, honest, loved by the subjects, kind to all well-wishers, master<br>of his passions, and the chastiser of all that are not good. Forgiveness,<br>renunciation, self-control, knowledge of the scriptures, mercy to all<br>creatures, competence to rule according to the dictates of virtue, of all<br>these attributes of royalty exist in Yudhishthira. Thou art not the son<br>of a king, and art always sinfully inclined towards thy relatives. O<br>wretch, how canst thou succeed in appropriating this kingdom that<br>lawfully belongeth to others? Dispelling this delusion, give half the<br>kingdom with (a share of the) animals and other possessions. Then, O<br>king, mayest thou hope to live for some time with thy younger brothers.'"
