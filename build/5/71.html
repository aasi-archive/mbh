The assembled Kauravas will behold that high-souled and adorable<br>One, that slayer of foes, that chief of the Vrishnis, uttering words full<br>of kindness, and fascinating all of my party. I put myself in the hand of<br>that Eternal one, that Rishi endued with knowledge of Self, that ocean of<br>eloquence, that Being who is easily attainable by ascetics, that bird<br>called Arishta furnished with beautiful wings, that destroyer of<br>creatures, that refuge of the universe; that one of a thousand heads,<br>that Creator and Destroyer of all things, that Ancient one, that one<br>without beginning, middle, or end, that one of infinite achievements,<br>that cause of the Prime seed, that unborn one, that Eternity's self, that<br>highest of the high, that Creator of the three worlds, that Author of<br>gods, Asuras, Nagas, and Rakshasas, that foremost of all learned persons<br>and rulers of men, that younger brother of Indra.'"
