                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'What did that Pandava king, the son of Dharma, say,<br>O Sanjaya, after hearing that a large force hath been assembled here for<br>gladdening us? How also is Yudhishthira acting, in view of the coming<br>strife, O Suta, who amongst his brothers and sons are looking up to his<br>face, desirous of receiving his orders? Provoked as he is by the<br>deceptions of my wicked sons, who, again, are dissuading that king of<br>virtuous behaviour and conversant with virtue, saying,&#8212;Have peace?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'All the Panchalas, along with the other sons of Pandu,<br>are looking up to Yudhishthira's face, blessed be thou, and he too is<br>restraining them all. Multitudes of cars belonging to the Pandavas and<br>the Panchalas are coming in separate bodies for gladdening Yudhishthira,<br>the son of Kunti, ready to march to the field of battle. As the sky<br>brightens up at the advent of the rising sun, so the Panchalas are<br>rejoicing at their union with Kunti's son of blazing splendour, risen<br>like a flood of light. The Panchalas, the Kekayas, and the Matsyas, along<br>with the very herdsmen that attend on their kine and sheep, are rejoicing<br>and gladdening Yudhishthira, the son of Pandu. Brahmana and Kshatriya<br>girls and the very daughters of the Vaisyas, in large number, are coming<br>in playful mood for beholding Partha accounted in coat of mail.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Tell us, O Sanjaya, of the forces of<br>Dhrishtadyumna, as also of the Somakas, and of all others, with which the<br>Pandavas intend to fight with us.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus interrogated, in the midst of the Kurus<br>and in their very hall, the son of Gavalgana' became thoughtful for a<br>moment and seemed to draw repeatedly deep and long sights; and suddenly<br>he fell down in a swoon without any apparent reason. Then in that<br>assembly of kings, Vidura said loudly, 'Sanjaya, O great king, hath<br>fallen down on the ground senseless, and cannot utter a word, bereft of<br>sense and his intellect clouded.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Without doubt, Sanjaya, having seen those mighty<br>car-warriors, the sons of Kunti, hath his mind filled with great anxiety<br>in consequence of those tigers among men.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having recovered consciousness, and being<br>comforted, Sanjaya addressed king Dhritarashtra in the midst of that<br>concourse of Kurus in that hall, saying, 'Indeed, O king of kings, I saw<br>those great warriors, the sons of Kunti, thinned in body, in consequence<br>of the restraint in which they had lived in the place of the king of the<br>Matsyas. Hear, O King, with whom the Pandavas will contend against you.<br>With that hero Dhrishtadyumna as their ally, they will fight against you.<br>With that personage of virtuous soul, who never forsaketh truth through<br>anger or fear, temptation, or for the sake of wealth, of disputation; and<br>who is, O King, a very authority in matters of religion, himself being<br>the best of those that practise virtue;&#8212;with him, who hath never made an<br>enemy, the sons of Pandu will fight against you.' He unto whom no one on<br>earth is equal in might of arms, and who, wielding his bow had brought<br>all kings under subjection, and who, vanquishing of old all the people of<br>Kasi and Anga and Magadha, as also the Kalingas;&#8212;with that Bhimasena<br>will the sons of Pandu fight against, you. Indeed, he through whose might<br>the four sons of Pandu quickly could alight on the earth, having issued<br>forth from the (burning) house of lac that son of Kunti, Vrikodara, who<br>became the means of their rescue from the cannibal Hidimva; that son of<br>Kunti, Vrikodara, who became their refuge when the daughter of Yajnasena<br>was being carried away by Jayadratha; indeed, with that Bhima. who<br>rescued the assembled Pandavas from the conflagration at Varanavata; even<br>with him (as their ally) will they fight against you. He, who for the<br>gratification of Krishna slew the Krodhavasas, having penetrated the<br>rugged and terrible mountains of Gandhamadana, he to whose arms hath been<br>imparted the might of ten thousand elephants; with that Bhimasena (as<br>their ally) the Pandavas will fight against you. That hero, who, for the<br>gratification of Agni, with Krishna only for his second, bravely<br>vanquished of yore Purandara in fight; he who gratified by combat that<br>God of gods, the trident-bearing lord of Uma&#8212;Mahadeva himself having the<br>mountains for his abode; that foremost of warriors who subjugated all the<br>kings of the earth&#8212;with that Vijaya (as their ally) the Pandavas will<br>encounter you in battle. That wonderful warrior Nakula, who vanquished<br>the whole of the western world teeming with Mlechchas, is present in the<br>Pandava camp. With that handsome hero, that unrivalled bowman, that son<br>of Madri, O Kauravya, the Pandavas will fight against you. He who<br>vanquished in battle the warriors of Kasi, Anga, and Kalinga,&#8212;with that<br>Sahadeva will the Pandavas encounter you in battle. He, who in energy<br>hath for his equals only four men on earth, viz., Aswatthaman and<br>Dhrishtaketu and Rukmi and Pradyumna,&#8212;with that Sahadeva, youngest in<br>years, that hero among men, that gladdener of Madri's heart, with him, O<br>King, will you have a destructive battle. She, who, while living of yore<br>as the daughter of the king of Kasi, had practised the austerest<br>penances; she, who, O bull of the Bharata race, desiring even in a<br>subsequent life to compass the destruction of Bhishma, took her birth as<br>the daughter of Panchala, and accidentally became afterwards a male; who,<br>O tiger among men, is conversant with the merits and demerits of both<br>sexes; that invincible prince of the Panchala who encountered the<br>Kalingas in battle, with what Sikhandin skilled in every weapon, will the<br>Pandavas fight against you. She whom a Yaksha for Bhishma's destruction<br>metamorphosed into a male, with that formidable bowman will the Pandavas<br>fight against you. With those mighty bowmen, all, brothers those five<br>Kekaya princes, with those heroes clad in mail will the Pandavas fight<br>against you. With that warrior of long arms: endued with great activity<br>in the use of weapons, possessed of intelligence and prowess incapable of<br>being baffled, with that Yuyudhana, the lion of the Vrishni race, will<br>you have to fight. He, who had been the refuge of the high-souled<br>Pandavas for a time, with that Virata, will ye have an encounter in<br>battle. The lord of Kasi, that mighty car-warrior who ruleth in Varanasi<br>hath become an ally of theirs; with him the Pandavas will fight against<br>you. The high-souled sons of Draupadi, tender in years but invincible in<br>battle, and unapproachable like snakes of virulent poison, with them,<br>will the Pandavas fight against you. He, that in energy is like unto<br>Krishna and in self-restraint unto Yudhishthira, with that Abhimanyu,<br>will the Pandavas fight against you. That war-like son of Sisupala,<br>Dhrishtaketu of great fame, who in energy is beyond comparison and who<br>when angry is incapable of being withstood in battle, with that king of<br>the Chedis who has joined the Pandavas at the head of an Akshauhini of<br>his own, will the sons of Pandu fight against you. He that is the refuge<br>of the Pandavas, even as Vasava is of the celestials, with that Vasudeva,<br>the Pandavas will fight against you. He also, O bull of Bharata race,<br>Sarabha the brother of the king of the Chedis, who again is united with<br>Karakarsa, with both these, the Pandavas will fight against you.<br>Sahadeva, the son of Jarasandha, and Jayatsena, both unrivalled heroes in<br>battle, are resolved upon fighting for the Pandavas. And Drupada too,<br>possessed of great might, and followed by a large force, and reckless of<br>his life, is resolved to fight for the Pandavas. Relying upon these and<br>other kings by hundreds, of both the eastern and northern countries, king<br>Yudhishthira the just, is prepared for battle.'"
