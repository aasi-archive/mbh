                            "Satyaki said, 'Even as a man's heart is, so doth he speak! Thou art<br>speaking in strict conformity with the nature of thy heart. There are<br>brave men, and likewise those that are cowards. Men may be divided into<br>these two well defined classes. As upon a single large tree there may be<br>two boughs one of which beareth fruits while the other doth not, so from<br>the self-same line of progenitors may spring persons that are imbecile as<br>well as those that are endowed with great strength O thou bearing the<br>sign of a plough on thy banner, I do not, in sooth, condemn the words<br>thou hast spoken, but I simply condemn those, O son of Madhu, who are<br>listening to thy words! How, indeed, can he, who unblushingly dares<br>attach even the slightest blame in the virtuous king Yudhishthira be<br>permitted to speak at all in the midst of the assembly? Persons clever in<br>the game of dice challenged the magnanimous Yudhishthira unskilled as he<br>is in play, and confiding in them he was defeated! Can such persons be<br>said to have virtuously won the game? If they had come to Yudhishthira<br>while playing in this house with his brothers and defeated him there,<br>then what they would have won would have been righteously won. But they<br>challenged Yudhishthira who was bound in conscience to follow the rules<br>observed by the military caste, and they won by a trick. What is there in<br>this conduct of theirs that is righteous? And how can this Yudhishthira<br>here, having performed to the utmost the stipulations entered into by way<br>of stakes in the play, freed from the promise of a sojourn in the forest,<br>and therefore entitled to his ancestral throne, humble himself? Even if<br>Yudhishthira coveted other people's possessions, still it would not<br>behove him to beg! How can they be said to be righteous and not intent on<br>usurping the throne when, although the Pandavas have lived out their<br>sojourn of concealment unrecognised, they still say that the latter had<br>been recognised? They were besought by Bhishma and the magnanimous Drona,<br>but they would not yet consent to give back to the Pandavas the throne<br>that belongeth to them by right of birth. The means with which I would<br>beseech them would be sharp arrows. I shall fight and with a strong hand<br>force them to prostrate themselves at the feet of the illustrious son of<br>Kunti. If, however, they do not bow at the feet of the wise Yudhishthira,<br>then they and their partisans must go to the regions of Yama. When<br>Yuyudhana (myself) is enraged and resolved to fight, they, to be sure,<br>are unequal to withstand his impetus, as mountains are unable to resist<br>that of the thunderbolt. Who can withstand Arjuna in fight, or him who<br>hath the discus for his weapon in battle, or myself as well? Who can<br>withstand the unapproachable Bhima? And who, having regard for his life,<br>would come near the twin brothers who firmly grasp their bows and<br>resemble the death-dealing Yama in intelligence? Who would approach<br>Dhrishtadyumna, the son of Drupada, or these five sons of the Pandavas<br>who have added lustre to Draupadi's name, rivalling their fathers in<br>valour, equal to them in every respect and full of martial pride, or him<br>of the powerful bow, Subhadra's son, irresistible by even the gods<br>themselves; or Gada, or Pradyumna, or Samva, resembling Yama or the<br>thunderbolt or fire? We shall slay Dhritarashtra's son and Sakuni and<br>Karna in battle, and place the Pandava on the throne. There is no sin in<br>slaying them that are bent on slaying us: but to be a beggar before foes<br>is both impious and infamous. I ask you to be diligent in doing that<br>which is heartily desired by Yudhishthira. Let Pandu's son get back the<br>kingdom resigned by Dhritarashtra! Either Yudhishthira should get back<br>his kingdom this very day or all our enemies shall lie down on the earth<br>slain by me!'
