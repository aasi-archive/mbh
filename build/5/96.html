                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing these words uttered by the high-souled<br>Kesava, all the persons who sat in that assembly remained silent, their<br>hair standing on their ends. And all the kings thought within themselves<br>that there was no man who could dare reply to that speech. And seeing<br>that all the kings sat silent, Jamadagni's son (addressing Duryodhana)<br>then said these words in that assembly of Kurus, 'Listen confidingly to<br>my words illustrated by an example, and seek thy own good if my speech<br>recommends itself to thee. There was a king of yore named Dambhodbhava,<br>who was the Head of the earth. It hath been heard by us that his<br>sovereignty extended over the whole world. And that mighty car-warrior,<br>rising every morning after the night had passed away, called the<br>Brahmanas and the Kshatriyas unto himself and asked them, saying, 'Be he<br>a Sudra, a Vaisya, a Kshatriya, or a Brahmana, is there any one who is<br>superior or even equal to me in battle?' And uttering these words that<br>king wandered over the earth, intoxicated with pride and thinking of<br>nothing else. And it so happened that certain Brahmanas endued with high<br>souls, conversant with the Vedas, and fearing nothing on earth,<br>counselled the monarch, repeatedly boasting of his prowess, to curb his<br>pride. But though forbidden by those Brahmanas to boast in that way, the<br>king continued to ask the Brahmanas as before the same question day after<br>day. And some high-souled Brahmanas then, endued with ascetic merit and<br>acquainted with the proofs furnished by the Vedas, were inflamed with<br>anger, and addressing that proud and boastful king intoxicated with<br>prosperity, told him, 'There are two persons who are foremost of all men<br>and who are always victorious in battle. Thou, O king, wilt by no means<br>be equal to them if thou seekest an encounter with any one of them.' And<br>thus addressed by them, the king asked those Brahmanas, saying, 'Where<br>may those two heroes be found? In what race are they born? What feats<br>have they achieved? And who are they? And the Brahmanas answered him,<br>saying, It had been heard by us that those two persons are ascetics<br>called Nara and Narayana. They have both taken their births in the race<br>of man. Go and fight with them, O king. It is that illustrious pair, Nara<br>and Narayana, who are now practising the severest of penances in some<br>hidden region of the mountains of Gandhamadana.' Hearing those words of<br>the Brahmanas, that king speedily mustered his large army consisting of<br>six kinds of forces,[7] and unable to bear their reputation, marched to<br>the spot where those unvanquished ascetics were, and arrived at the<br>rugged and frightful mountains of Gandhamadana. He began to search after<br>those Rishis, and at last, came upon them concealed within the woods. And<br>beholding those two best of persons emaciated with hunger and thirst,<br>their veins swollen and visible, and themselves much afflicted with cold<br>winds, and the hot rays of the sun, he approached them, and touching<br>their feet, enquired after their welfare. And the two Rishis received the<br>king hospitably, with fruits and roots, and a seat and water. And they<br>then enquired after the king's business, saying, 'Let it be done.' And<br>thus addressed by them, the king said unto them the same words that he<br>was in the habit of saying unto all. And he said, 'The whole earth has<br>been conquered by the might of my arms. All my foes have been slain.<br>Desiring a battle with you both I have come to this mountain. Offer me<br>this hospitality. I have been cherishing this wish from a long time.'<br>Thus addressed, Nara and Narayana said, 'O best of kings, wrath and<br>covetousness have no place in this retreat. How can a battle, therefore,<br>be possible here? There are no weapons here, and nothing of<br>unrighteousness and malice. Seek battle elsewhere. There are many<br>Kshatriyas on earth.'<br><br>"Rama continued, 'Although thus addressed, the king still pressed them<br>for giving him battle. The Rishis, however, continually soothed him and<br>overlooked his importunity. King Dambhodbhava, still desirous of battle,<br>repeatedly summoned those Rishis to fight. Nara, then, O Bharata, taking<br>up a handful of grass-blades, said, 'Desirous of battle as thou art,<br>come, O Kshatriya, and fight! Take up all thy arms, and array thy troops.<br>I will curb thy eagerness for battle hereafter!' Dambhodbhava then said,<br>If, O ascetic, thou thinkest this weapon of thine fit to be used against<br>us, I shall fight with thee though thou mayest use that weapon, for I<br>have come hither desirous of fighting.' Saying this, Dambhodbhava with<br>all his troops, desirous of slaying that ascetic, covered all sides with<br>a shower of arrows. That ascetic, however, by means of those blades of<br>grass, baffled all those terrible shafts of the king that were capable of<br>mangling the bodies of hostile warriors. The invincible Rishi then let<br>off towards the king his own terrible weapon made of grass-blades and<br>which was incapable of being counteracted. And highly wonderful was that<br>which happened, for that ascetic, incapable of missing his aim, pierced<br>and cut off, by those grass-blades alone, the eyes and ears and noses of<br>the hostile warriors, aided also by his power of illusion. And beholding<br>the entire welkin whitened by those grass-blades, the king fell at the<br>feet of the Rishi and said, 'Let me be blessed! Ever inclined to grant<br>protection unto those that sought it, Nara then, O king, said unto that<br>monarch, 'Be obedient to the Brahmanas and be virtuous. Never do so<br>again. O king, O tiger among monarchs, a conqueror of hostile towns, a<br>Kshatriya mindful of the duties of his own or, should never, within even<br>his heart, be as thou art. Filled with pride, never insult anybody on any<br>occasion, be inferior or superior to thee. Even such conduct would befit<br>thee. Acquiring wisdom, abandoning covetousness and pride, controlling<br>thy soul, restraining thy passions, practising forgiveness and humility,<br>and becoming amiable, O king, go, and cherish thy subjects. Without<br>ascertaining the strength and weakness of men, never insult any one under<br>any circumstances. Blessed be thou, and with our leave, go hence, and<br>never again behave in this way. At our command, enquire thou always of<br>the Brahmanas as to what is for thy good! The king then, worshipping the<br>feet of those two illustrious Rishis, returned to his city, and from that<br>time began to practise righteousness. Great indeed, was that feat<br>achieved of old by Nara. Narayana, again, became superior to Nara in<br>consequence of many more qualities. Therefore, O king, besides such<br>weapons as Kakudika, Suka, Naka, Akshisantarjana, Santana, Nartana,<br>Ghora, and Asyamodaka, are placed on the string of that best of bows<br>called Gandiva, go thou unto Dhananjaya, laying aside thy pride Struck<br>with these weapons, men always yield up their lives. Indeed, these<br>weapons have other means corresponding with the eight passions, such as<br>lust, wrath, covetousness, vanity, insolence, pride, malice, and<br>selfishness. Struck with them, men are confounded, and move about<br>frantically deprived of their senses. Under their influence, persons<br>always sleep heavily, cut capers, vomit, pass urine and excreta, weep,<br>and laugh incessantly. Indeed, that Arjuna is irresistible in fight, who<br>hath for his friend Narayana&#8212;the Creator and Lord of all the<br>worlds&#8212;fully acquainted with the course of everything. Who is there in<br>the three worlds, O Bharata, who would venture to vanquish that hero&#8212;the<br>Ape-bannered Jishnu&#8212;who hath no equal in battle? Countless are the<br>virtues that reside in Partha. Janardana again, is superior to him. Thou<br>art thyself well-acquainted with Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti. They that<br>were Nara and Narayana in days of yore are now Arjuna and Kesava. Know<br>then, O great king, who those brave and foremost of persons are. If thou<br>believest in this and dost not mistrust me adopt thou a virtuous<br>resolution and make peace with the sons of Pandu. If thou regardest this<br>as thy good, viz., that there should be no disunion in thy family, then<br>make peace, O foremost of Bharata's race, and do not set thy heart upon<br>battle. O thou, that are foremost of Kuru's line, the race to which thou<br>belongest is highly regarded on earth. Let that regard continue to be<br>paid to it. Blessed be thou, think of what conduces to thy own welfare.'"
