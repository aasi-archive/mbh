                            "Kanwa said, 'Meanwhile, O Bharata, the mighty Garuda heard what had<br>happened, viz., the bestowal by Sakra of length of days on the Naga<br>Sumukha. And inflamed with great anger, that ranger of the firmament,<br>Suparna, smiting the three worlds by the hurricane caused by the<br>flappings of his wings, quickly came to Vasava. And Garuda said, 'O<br>illustrious one, disregarding me why hast thou interfered with my<br>sustenance. Having granted me a boon of thy own will, why dost thou now<br>withdraw it? The Supreme Lord of all creatures hath, from the beginning,<br>ordained what my food is to be. Why dost thou then stand in the way of<br>that divine decree? I had selected this great Naga and had fixed time,<br>for O god, I had intended to offer the meat of his body, as sustenance to<br>my numerous progeny. When he, therefore, hath obtained a boon from thee<br>and hath become indestructible by me, how can I henceforth dare kill<br>another of his species? Dost thou sport thus, O Vasava, as thou listest?<br>I, however, shall have to die, as also the members of my family' and the<br>servants whom I have engaged in my house. That will, I think, gratify<br>thee, O Vasava! Indeed, O slayer of Vala and Vritra, I deserve all this,<br>nay more, since being the lord of the three worlds in might. I yet<br>consented to become the servant of another. O monarch of the three<br>worlds, Vishnu, however, is not the only cause of my inferiority, for<br>though, O Vasava, I am quite thy equal, yet the sovereignty of the three<br>worlds resteth on thee, O chief of the celestials. Like thee, I also have<br>a daughter of Daksha for my mother and Kasyapa for my father. Like thee,<br>I also can, without any fatigue, bear the weight of the three worlds. I<br>have strength that is immeasurable and incapable of being resisted by any<br>creature. In the war with the Daityas I also achieved grand feats.<br>Srutasri and Srutasena and Vivaswat, and Rochanamukha, and Prasrura, and<br>Kalakaksha amongst the sons of Diti were slain by me. Perching yet on the<br>flag-staff of thy younger brother's car I carefully protect it in battle,<br>and sometimes also I bear that brother of thine on my back. It is,<br>perhaps, for this that thou disregardest me. Who else in the universe is<br>there that is capable of bearing such heavy burthens? Who is there that<br>is stronger than myself? Superior though I am, I yet bear on my back this<br>younger brother of thine with all his friends. When, however,<br>disregarding me thou hast interfered with my foods, thou hast, O Vasava,<br>inflicted disgrace on me, like this younger brother of thine that had<br>hitherto been disgracing me by making me bear him on my back. As regards<br>thyself, O Vishnu, amongst all those endued with prowess and strength<br>that have been born of Aditi's womb, thou art superior in strength. Yet<br>thee I bear without any fatigue, with only one of my feathers. Think<br>coolly then, O brother, who amongst us is stronger?'<br><br>"Kanwa continued, 'Hearing the proud words of that bird foreshadowing<br>danger the bearer of the discus, provoking Tarkshya still more, said unto<br>him, 'Though so very weak, why dost thou, O Garuda, yet regard thyself<br>strong, O oviparous creature, it ill behoveth thee to vaunt thus in our<br>presence. The three worlds united together cannot bear the weight of my<br>body. I myself bear my own weight and thine also. Come now, bear thou the<br>weight of this one right arm of mine. If thou canst bear even this, thy<br>boast would be regarded as reasonable. Saying this, the holy one placed<br>his arms on Garuda's shoulders. Thereupon the latter fell down, afflicted<br>with its weight, confounded, and deprived of his senses. And Garuda, felt<br>that the weight of that one arm of Vishnu was as great as that of the<br>entire Earth with her mountains. Endued with might infinitely greater,<br>Vishnu, however, did not afflict him much. Indeed, Achyuta did not take<br>his life. That ranger of the sky, afflicted then by that immense weight,<br>gasped for breath, and began to cast off his feathers. With every limb<br>weakened, and utterly confounded, Garuda was almost deprived of his<br>senses. The winged offspring of Vinata then, thus confounded and almost<br>deprived of his senses, and rendered utterly helpless, bowing unto Vishnu<br>with bent bead, feebly addressed him, saying, 'O illustrious Lord, the<br>essence of that strength which sustains the universe dwelleth in this<br>body of thine. What wonder, therefore, that I should be crushed down to<br>the earth by a single arm of thine, stretched out at thy pleasure. It<br>behoveth thee, O divine Lord, to forgive this winged creature that<br>perches on thy flag-staff&#8212;this fool intoxicated with pride of strength,<br>but now rendered utterly helpless. Thy great strength, O divine Lord, was<br>never known to me before. It was for this that I regarded my own might to<br>be unequalled.' Thus addressed, the illustrious Vishnu became gratified,<br>and addressing Garuda with affection, said, 'Let not thy behaviour be<br>such again.' And saying this, Upendra threw Sumukha with the toe of his<br>foot upon Garuda's breast. And from that time, O king, Garuda hath ever<br>lived in friendship with that snake. It was thus, O king, that mighty and<br>illustrious Garuda, the son of Vinata, afflicted by the might of Vishnu,<br>was cured of his pride.'<br><br>"Kanwa continued, 'In the same way, O son of Gandhari, thou livest, O<br>son, as long as thou approachest not the heroic sons of Pandu in battle.<br>Who is there whom Bhima, that foremost of smiters, that mighty son of<br>Vayu and Dhananjaya, the son of Indra, cannot slay in battle? Vishnu<br>himself, and Vayu and Dharma, and the Aswins,&#8212;these gods are thy<br>enemies. Let alone an encounter with them, thou art not competent even to<br>look at them on the field. Therefore, O prince, do not set thy heart upon<br>war; let peace be made through the agency of Vasudeva. It behoveth thee<br>to save thy race thus. This great ascetic Narada witnessed with his own<br>eyes the incident (I have related to thee) which shows the greatness of<br>Vishnu, and know that this Krishna is that bearer of the discus and the<br>mace!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of the Rishi, Duryodhana<br>contracted his eye-brows and began to breathe heavily. And casting his<br>eyes then on Radha's son, he burst out into a loud laughter. And setting<br>at naught those words of the Rishi, that wicked wretch began to slap his<br>thigh that resembled the trunk of an elephant. And addressing the Rishi,<br>he said, 'I am, O great Rishi, precisely what the Creator hath made me.<br>What is to be, must be. What also hath been ordained in my case must<br>happen, I cannot act otherwise. What can these senseless declamations,<br>therefore, avail?'"
