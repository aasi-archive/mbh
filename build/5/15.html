                            "Salya said, 'Thus addressed by Sachi, the illustrious god said to her<br>again, 'This is not the time for putting forth valour. Nahusha is<br>stronger than I am. O beautiful lady, he hath been strengthened by the<br>Rishis with the merits of offerings to the gods and the Pitris. I shall<br>have recourse to policy now. Thou wilt have to carry it out, O goddess. O<br>lady, thou must do it secretly and must not disclose it to any person. O<br>lady of a beautiful waist, going to Nahusha in private, tell him, O lord<br>of the Universe, thou must visit me mounted on a nice vehicle borne by<br>Rishis. In that case I shall be pleased and shall place myself at thy<br>disposal. This shouldst thou tell him.' And thus addressed by the king of<br>the gods, his lotus-eyed consort expressed her consent and went to<br>Nahusha. And Nahusha, having seen her, smilingly addressed her, saying,<br>'I welcome thee, O lady of lovely thighs. What is thy pleasure, O thou of<br>sweet smiles. Accept me, O lady of propitious looks, who am devoted to<br>thee. What is thy will, O spirited dame. I shall do thy wish, O lady of<br>propitious looks and slender waist. Nor needst thou be bashful, O thou of<br>lovely hips. Have trust in me. In the name of truth I swear, O goddess,<br>that I shall do thy bidding.'<br><br>"Sachi said, 'O lord of Universe, I wanted the time that thou hast<br>assigned to me. Thereafter, O lord of the gods, thou shalt be my husband.<br>I have a wish. Attend and hear, O king of the gods. What it is I shall<br>say, O king, so that thou mayst do what I like. This is an indulgence<br>that I ask from thy love for me. If thou grantest it, I shall be at thy<br>disposal. Indra had horses for carrying him, and elephants, and cars. I<br>want thee to have, O king of the gods, a novel vehicle, such as never<br>belonged to Vishnu, or Rudra, or the Asuras, or the Rakshasas, O lord.<br>Let a number of highly dignified Rishis, united together, bear thee in a<br>palanquin. This is what commends itself to me. Thou shouldst not liken<br>thyself to the Asuras or the gods. Thou absorbest the strength of all by<br>thy own strength as soon as they look at thee. There is none so strong as<br>to be able to stand before thee.'<br><br>"Salya continued, 'Thus addressed, Nahusha was very much pleased. And the<br>lord of the deities said to that lady of faultless features, 'O lady of<br>the fairest complexion, thou hast spoken of a vehicle never heard of<br>before. I like it exceedingly, O goddess. I am in thy power, O thou of<br>lovely face. He cannot be a feeble person who employeth Rishis for<br>bearing him. I have practised austerities, and am mighty. I am the lord<br>of the past, the present, and the future. The Universe would be no more<br>if I were in rage. The whole Universe is established in me. O thou of<br>sweet smiles, the gods, the Asuras and Gandharvas, and snakes, and<br>Rakshasas are together unable to cope with me when I am in rage.<br>Whomsoever I gaze upon I divest him of his energy. Therefore, thy request<br>I shall no doubt fulfil, O goddess. The seven Rishis, and also the<br>regenerate Rishis, shall carry me. See our greatness and splendour, O<br>lady of lovely complexion.'<br><br>"Salya continued, 'Having thus addressed that goddess of lovely face, and<br>having dismissed her thus, he harnessed to his heavenly car a number of<br>saints devoted to the practice of austerities. A disregarder of<br>Brahmanas, endued with power and intoxicated with pride, capricious, and<br>of vicious soul, he employed those saints to carry him. Meanwhile,<br>dismissed by Nahusha, Sachi went to Vrihaspati and said, 'But little<br>remaineth of the term assigned by Nahusha to me. But compassionate unto<br>me who respect thee so, and quickly find out Indra.'<br><br>"The illustrious Vrihaspati then said to her, 'Very good, thou needst<br>not, O goddess, fear, Nahusha of vicious soul. Surely, he shall not long<br>retain his power. The wretch, in fact, is already gone, being regardless<br>of virtue and because, O lovely dame, of his employing the great saints<br>to carry him. And I shall perform a sacrifice for the destruction of this<br>vicious wretch, and I shall find out Indra. Thou needst not fear. Fare<br>thee well.' And Vrihaspati of great power then kindled a fire in the<br>prescribed form, and put the very best offerings upon it in order to<br>ascertain where the king of the gods was. And having put his offerings, O<br>king, he said to the Fire, 'Search out Indra.' And there upon that<br>revered god, the eater of burnt offerings, assumed of his own accord a<br>wonderful feminine form and vanished from sight at that very spot. And<br>endued with speed of the mind, he searched everywhere, mountains and<br>forests, earth and sky, and came back to Vrihaspati within the twinkling<br>of the eye. And Agni said, Vrihaspati, nowhere in these places do I find<br>the king of the gods. The waters alone remain to be searched. I am always<br>backward in entering the waters. I have no ingress therein. O Brahmana,<br>what I am to do for thee.' The preceptor of the gods then said to him, 'O<br>illustrious god, do thou enter the water.'<br><br>"Agni said, 'I cannot enter the water. Therein it is extinction that<br>awaits me. I place myself in thy hand, O thou of great effulgence. Mayst<br>thou fare well! Fire rose from water, the military caste rose from the<br>priestly caste; and iron had its origin in stone. The power of these<br>which can penetrate all other things, hath no operation upon the sources<br>from which they spring.'"
