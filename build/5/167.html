                            "Bhishma said, 'Sudhakshina, the ruler of the Kamvojas, is in my<br>judgment, equal to a single Ratha. Desiring the success of thy object, he<br>will certainly fight with the enemy in battle. O best of kings, the<br>Kauravas will behold the prowess of this lion among car-warriors exerted<br>for thee, to be equal to that of Indra himself in battle. As regards the<br>car-army of this king, O monarch, those smiters of fierce impetus, the<br>Kamvojas, will cover a large area like a flight of locusts! Coming from<br>(the province of) Mahishmati, Nila, accoutred in blue mail, is one of thy<br>Rathas. With his car-army he will cause a great havoc among thy foes, O<br>child, he had hostilities with Sahadeva. O king, he will continually<br>fight for thee, O thou of Kuru's race. Accomplished in battle, and of<br>fierce energy and prowess, (the princes) Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti are<br>both regarded as excellent Rathas. These two heroes among men will<br>consume the troops of thy foes, with maces and bearded darts, and swords<br>and long shafts, and javelins hurled from their hands. Like a couple of<br>(elephant) leaders sporting in the midst of their herds, these two<br>princes, O monarch, longing for battle, will range the field, each like<br>Yama himself. The five (royal) brothers of Trigarta are, in my judgment,<br>all foremost of Rathas. The sons of Pritha provoked hostilities with them<br>at Virata's city on that (well-known) occasion. Like huge Makaras, O<br>king, agitating the stream of the Ganges crested with high waves, they<br>will agitate the ranks of the Parthas in battle. All the five, O king,<br>are Rathas, having Satyaratha (amongst them) as their first. Remembering<br>the wrongs inflicted on them of old by that son of Pandu who is Bhima's<br>younger brother, when the latter, O Bharata, on his car drawn by white<br>steeds, was engaged, O monarch, in subjugating all the kings of the<br>earth, they will certainly exert themselves bravely in battle.<br>Encountering many Maharathas&#8212;chief of bowmen&#8212;leaders of Kshatriyas&#8212;on<br>the side of the Parthas, they will certainly slay them. Thy son Lakshmana<br>and the son also of Dussasana&#8212;those tigers among men are both<br>unretreating in battle. In prime of youth, of delicate limbs, endued with<br>great activity, those two princes, well-versed with battles and capable<br>of leading all, those tigers among Kurus, those car-warriors, are, I<br>think, two of our best Rathas. Devoted to the duties of the Kshatriya<br>order, those two heroes will achieve great feats. Dandadhara, O monarch,<br>is, O bull among men, equal to a single Ratha. Guarded by his own<br>soldiers, he will fight in battle for thee. Endued with great impetus and<br>prowess, king Vrihadvala, the ruler of the Kosalas, is, in my judgment, O<br>sire, equal to one Ratha. Fierce in arms, this mighty bowman, devoted to<br>the good of the Dhartarashtras, will exert himself powerfully in battle,<br>gladdening his own friends. Kripa, the son of Saradwat is, O king, a<br>leader of leaders of car-ranks. Reckless even of life which is so dear,<br>he will consume thy foes. Born among a clump of heath as the son of that<br>great sage, viz., the preceptor Gautama, otherwise called Saradwat, he is<br>invincible like Kartikeya himself. Consuming untold warriors armed with<br>various weapons and bows, he will, O sire, roam forth on the field of<br>battle like a blazing fire.'"
