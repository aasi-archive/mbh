                            "Narada said, 'Alighting then on the peak of the Rishabha, the Brahmana<br>and the Bird beheld a Brahmana lady of the name of Sandili, engaged there<br>on ascetic penances. And Galava and Garuda both saluted her by bending<br>their heads, and worshipped her. And thereupon, the lady enquired after<br>their welfare and gave them seats. And having taken their seats, both of<br>them took the cooked food the lady offered them, after having first<br>dedicated it to the gods with Mantras. And having taken that food, they<br>laid themselves down on the ground and fell into a profound sleep. And<br>Garuda, from desire of leaving that place, upon awakening, found that his<br>wings, had fallen off. Indeed, he had become like a ball of flesh, with<br>only his head and legs. And beholding him come to that plight, Galava<br>sorrowfully enquired, saying, 'What is this condition that has overtaken<br>thee as the consequence of thy sojourn here? Alas, how long shall we have<br>to reside here? Hadst thou harboured any evil and sinful thought in thy<br>mind? It cannot, I am sure, be any trivial sin of which thou hast been<br>guilty.' Thus addressed, Garuda replied unto the Brahmana, saying,<br>'Indeed, O regenerate one, I entertained the thought of carrying away<br>this lady crowned with ascetic success from this spot to where the<br>Creator himself, the divine Mahadeva, the eternal Vishnu, and both Virtue<br>and Sacrifice personified, live together, for as I thought this lady<br>should live there. I shall now, from desire of doing myself good,<br>prostrate myself before this holy lady, and pray unto her, saying,&#8212;with<br>a heart full of pity, I had, indeed, entertained such a thought. Whether<br>I acted rightly or wrongly, even this was the wish, evidently against thy<br>own, that was cherished by me from my respect for thee. It behoveth thee,<br>therefore, to grant me forgiveness, from the nobility of thy heart.' That<br>lady became gratified with that prince of birds and that bull of<br>Brahmanas. And addressing Garuda, she said, 'Fear not, O thou of<br>beautiful feathers. Resume thy wings, and cast off thy fears. I was<br>contempted by thee, but know that I do not pardon contempt. That sinful<br>being who entertains contempt for me, would speedily fall away from all<br>blissful regions. Without a single inauspicious indication about me, and<br>perfectly blameless as I am, I have, in consequence of the purity of my<br>conduct, attained to high ascetic success. Purity of conduct beareth<br>virtue as its fruit. Purity of conduct beareth wealth as its fruit. It is<br>purity of conduct that bringeth on prosperity. And it is purity of<br>conduct that driveth away all inauspicious indications. Go thou, O<br>blessed prince of birds, whithersoever thou wishest, from this place.<br>Never entertain contempt for me, and take care that thou dost not<br>contempt women that may even be truly blamable. Thou shalt again be, as<br>before, invested with both strength and energy.' At these words of that<br>lady Garuda had his wings again, and they became even stronger than<br>before. And then with Sandili's leave, Garuda with Galava on his back<br>took his departure. But they failed to find the kind of steeds they were<br>in search of. And it so happened that Viswamitra met Galava on the way.<br>And thereupon, that foremost of speakers addressed Galava in the presence<br>of Vinata's son and said, 'O regenerate one, the time is already come<br>when thou shouldst give me the wealth thou hadst promised me of thy own<br>accord. I do not know what thou mayst. I have waited so long. I will wait<br>for some time more. Seek thou the way by which thou mayst succeed (in the<br>matter of thy promise).' Hearing these words, Garuda addressed cheerless<br>Galava who was overwhelmed with sorrow, saying, 'What Viswamitra said<br>unto thee before hath now been repeated in my presence. Come, therefore,<br>O Galava, best of Brahmanas, we will deliberate on the matter. Without<br>giving thy preceptor the whole of the wealth (promised by thee), thou<br>canst not even sit down.'
