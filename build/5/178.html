                            "Bhishma said, 'Those virtuous ascetics then set themselves about their<br>usual avocations, thinking all the while as to what they should do for<br>that maiden. And some amongst them said, 'Let her be taken to her<br>father's abode.' And some amongst them set their hearts upon reproaching<br>ourselves. And some thought that repairing to the ruler of the Salwas, he<br>should be solicited to accept the maiden. And some said, 'No, that should<br>not be done, for she hath been rejected by him.' And after some time had<br>passed thus, those ascetics of rigid vows once more said unto her, 'What,<br>O blessed lady, can ascetics with senses under control do? Do not devote<br>thyself to a life in the woods, renouncing the world! O blessed lady,<br>listen to these words that are beneficial to thee! Depart hence, blessed<br>be thou, to thy father's mansion! The king, thy father, will do what<br>should next be done. O auspicious one, surrounded by every comfort, thou<br>mayest live there in happiness. Thou art a woman! At present, therefore,<br>O blessed one, thou hast no other protector save thy father. O thou of<br>the fairest complexion, as regards a woman, she hath her father for her<br>protector or her husband. Her husband is her protector when she is in<br>comfortable circumstances, but when plunged in misery, she hath her<br>father for her protector. A life in the woods is exceedingly painful,<br>especially to one that is delicate. Thou art a princess by birth; over<br>this, thou art, again, very delicate, O beautiful dame! O blessed lady,<br>there are numerous discomforts and difficulties attaching to a life in a<br>(woody) retreat, none of which, O thou of the fairest complexion, shalt<br>thou have to bear in thy father's abode!' Other ascetics, beholding that<br>helpless girl said to her, 'Seeing thee alone in deep and solitary woods,<br>kings may court thee! Therefore, set not thy heart upon such a course!'<br><br>"Hearing these words, Amva said, 'I am incapable of going back to my<br>father's abode in the city of Kasi, for without doubt I shalt then be<br>disregarded by all my relatives. Ye ascetics, I lived there, in my<br>father's abode, during my childhood. I cannot, however, now go to thither<br>where my father is. Protected by the ascetics, I desire to practise<br>ascetic austerities, so that in even future life of mine such sore<br>afflictions may not be mine! Ye best of ascetics, I desire, therefore, to<br>practise ascetic austerities!'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'When those Brahmanas were thinking thus about her,<br>there came into that forest that best of ascetics, the royal sage<br>Hotravahana. Then those ascetics reverenced the king with worship,<br>enquiries of welcome and courtesy, a seat, and water. And after he was<br>seated and had rested for a while, those denizens of the forest once more<br>began to address that maiden in the hearing of that royal sage. Hearing<br>the story of Amva and the king of Kasi, that royal sage of great energy<br>became very anxious at heart. Hearing her speak in that strain, and<br>beholding her (distressed), that royal sage of rigid austerities, viz.,<br>the high-souled Hotravahana, was filled with pity. Then, O lord, that<br>maternal grandsire of her rose up with trembling frame and causing that<br>maiden to sit on his lap, began to comfort her. He then acquired of her<br>in details about that distress of hers from its beginning. And she,<br>thereupon, represented to him minutely all that had happened. Hearing all<br>she said, the royal sage was filled with pity and grief. And that great<br>sage settled in mind what she would do. Trembling from agitation he<br>addressed the afflicted maiden sunk in woe, saying, 'Do not go back to<br>thy father's abode, O blessed lady! I am the father of thy mother. I will<br>dispel thy grief. Rely on me, O daughter! Great, indeed, must thy<br>affliction he when thou art so emaciated! At my advice, go unto the<br>ascetic Rama, the son of Jamadagni. Rama will dispel this great<br>affliction and grief of thine. He will slay Bhishma in battle if the<br>latter obeyeth not his behest. Go, therefore, unto that foremost one of<br>Bhrigu's race who resembleth the Yuga-fire itself in energy! That great<br>ascetic will place thee once more on the right track!' Hearing this, that<br>maiden, shedding tears all the while, saluted her maternal grandsire,<br>Hotravahana, with a bend of her head and addressed him, saying, 'Go I<br>will at thy command! But shall I succeed in obtaining a sight of that<br>reverend sire celebrated over the world? How will he dispel this poignant<br>grief of mine? And how shall I go to that descendant of Bhrigu? I desire<br>to know all this.'<br><br>"Hotravahana said, 'O blessed maiden, thou wilt behold Jamadagni's son,<br>Rama, who is devoted to truth and endued with great might and engaged in<br>austere penances in the great forest. Rama always dwelleth in that<br>foremost of the mountains called Mahendra. Many Rishis, learned in the<br>Vedas, and many Gandharvas and Apsaras also dwell there. Go, blessed be<br>thou, and tell him these words of mine, having saluted with thy bent head<br>that sage of rigid vows and great ascetic merit. Tell him also, O blessed<br>girl, all that thou seekest. If thou namest me, Rama will do everything<br>for thee, for Rama, the heroic son of Jamadagni, that foremost of all<br>bearers of arms, is a friend of mine highly pleased with me, and always<br>wisheth me well!' And while king Hotravahana, was saying all this unto<br>that maiden, thither appeared Akritavrana, a dear companion of Rama. And<br>on his advent those Munis by hundreds, and the Srinjaya king Hotravahana,<br>old in years, all stood up. And those denizens of the forest, uniting<br>with one another, did him all the rites of hospitality. And they all took<br>their seats surrounding him. And filled, O monarch, with gratification<br>and joy, they then started various delightful, laudable, and charming<br>subjects of discourse. And after their discourse was over, that royal<br>sage, the high-souled Hotravahana enquired of Akritavrana about Rama that<br>foremost of great sages, saying, 'O thou of mighty arms, where, O<br>Akritavrana, may that foremost of persons acquainted with the Vedas,<br>viz., Jamadagni's son of great prowess be seen?' Akritavrana answered him<br>saying, 'O lord, Rama always speaketh of thee, O king, saying,&#8212;That<br>royal sage of the Srinjayas is my dear friend,&#8212;I believe, Rama will be<br>here tomorrow morning. Thou wilt see him even here when he cometh to<br>behold thee. As regards this maiden, for what, O royal sage, hath she<br>come to the wood? Whose is she, and what is she to thee? I desire to know<br>all this.' Hotravahana. said, 'The favourite daughter of the ruler of<br>Kasi, she is, O lord, my daughter's child! The eldest daughter of the<br>king of Kasi, she is known by the name of Amva. Along with her two<br>younger sisters, O sinless one, she was in the midst of her Swayamvara<br>ceremonies. The names of her two younger sisters are Amvika and Amvalika,<br>O thou endued with wealth of asceticism! All the Kshatriya kings of the<br>earth were assembled together at the city of Kasi. And, O regenerate<br>Rishi, great festivities were going on there on account of (the<br>self-choice of) these maidens. In the midst of these, Santanu's son,<br>Bhishma, of mighty valour, disregarding all the kings, abducted the<br>girls. Vanquishing all the monarchs, the pure-souled prince Bhishma of<br>Bharata's race then reached Hastinapura, and representing everything unto<br>Satyavati, ordered his brother Vichitravirya's marriage to take place<br>with the girls he had brought. Beholding the arrangements for those<br>nuptials complete, this maiden, O bull among Brahmanas, then addressed<br>Ganga's son in the presence of his ministers and said,&#8212;I have, O hero,<br>within my heart chosen the lord of the Salwas to be my husband.<br>Conversant as thou art with morality, it behoveth thee not to bestow me<br>on thy brother, whose heart is given away to another!&#8212;Hearing these<br>words of hers, Bhishma took counsel with his ministers. Deliberating on<br>the matter, he, at last, with Satyavati's consent, dismissed this maiden,<br>Permitted thus by Bhishma, this girl gladly repaired to Salwa, the lord<br>of Saubha, and approaching him said,&#8212;Dismissed I have been by Bhishma.<br>See that I do not fall off from righteousness! In my heart, I have chosen<br>thee for my lord, O bull among kings. Salwa, however, rejected her,<br>suspecting the purity of her conduct. Even she hath come to these woods,<br>sacred for asceticism, being ardently inclined to devote herself to<br>ascetic penances! She was recognised by me from the account that she gave<br>of her parentage. As regards her sorrow, Bhishma is considered by her to<br>be its root!' After Hotravahana had ceased, Amva herself said, 'O holy<br>one, it is even so as this lord of earth, this author of my mother's<br>body, Hotravahana of the Srinjaya race hath said. I cannot venture to go<br>back to my own city, O thou that art endued with wealth of asceticism,<br>for shame and fear of disgrace, O great Muni! At present, O holy one,<br>even this is what hath been my determination, viz., that that would be my<br>highest duty which the holy Rama, O best of Brahmanas, might point out to<br>me!'"
