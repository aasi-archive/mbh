                            "Yudhishthira said, 'O Sanjaya, the righteous and the unrighteous, the<br>young and the old, the weak and the strong, are all under the control of<br>the Creator, It is that Supreme Lord who imparteth knowledge to the child<br>and childishness to the learned, according to his own will. If<br>Dhritarashtra ask thee about our strength, tell him everything truly,<br>having cheerfully consulted with everyone here and ascertained the truth.<br>O son of Gavalgana, repairing unto the Kurus, thou wilt salute the mighty<br>Dhritarashtra, and touching his feet enquire after his welfare speaking<br>in our name. And when seated in the midst of the Kurus, tell him from<br>us.&#8212;The sons of Pandu, O king, are living happily in consequence of thy<br>prowess. It was through thy grace, O repressor of foes, that those<br>children of tender years had obtained a kingdom. Having first bestowed a<br>kingdom on them, thou shouldst not now be indifferent to them, for<br>destruction then would overtake them! The whole of this kingdom, O<br>Sanjaya, is not fit to be owned by one person. Tell him again, from<br>us.&#8212;O sire, we wish to live united. Do not suffer thyself to be<br>vanquished by foes.&#8212;Thou shouldst again, O Sanjaya, bending thy head, in<br>my name salute the grandsire of the Bharatas, Bhishma, the son of<br>Santanu. Having saluted our grandsire, he should then be told.&#8212;By thee,<br>when Santanu's race was about to be extinct, it was revived. Therefore, O<br>sire, do that according to thy own judgment by which thy grandsons may<br>all live in amity with one another. Thou shouldst then address Vidura<br>also, that adviser of the Kurus, saying.&#8212;Counseleth peace, O amiable<br>one, from desire of doing good unto Yudhishthira.&#8212;Thou shouldst address<br>the unforbearing prince Duryodhana also, when seated in the midst of the<br>Kurus, beseeching him again and again, saying,&#8212;The insults thou hadst<br>offered to innocent and helpless Draupadi in the midst of the assembly,<br>we will quietly bear, simply because we have no mind to see the Kurus<br>slain. The other injuries also, both before and after that, the sons of<br>Pandu are quietly bearing, although they are possessed of might to avenge<br>them. All this, indeed, the Kauravas know. O amiable one, thou hadst even<br>exiled us dressed in deer-skins. We are bearing that also because we do<br>not want to see the Kurus slain. Dussasana, in obedience to thee, had<br>dragged Krishna, disregarding Kunti. That act also will be forgiven by<br>us. But, O chastiser of foes, we must have our proper share of the<br>kingdom. O bull among men, turn thy coveting heart from what belongeth to<br>others. Peace then, O king, will be amongst our gladdened selves. We are<br>desirous of peace; give us even a single province of the empire. Give us<br>even Kusasthala, Vrikasthala, Makandi, Varanavata, and for the fifth any<br>other that thou likest. Even this will end the quarrel. O Suyodhana, give<br>unto thy five brothers at least five villages,&#8212;O Sanjaya, O thou of<br>great wisdom, let there be peace between us and our cousins. Tell him<br>also,&#8212;Let brothers follow brothers, let sires unite with sons. Let the<br>Panchalas mingle with the Kurus in merry laughter. That I may see the<br>Kurus and the Panchalas whole and sound, is what I desire. O bull of the<br>Bharata race, with, cheerful hearts let us make peace. O Sanjaya, I am<br>equally capable of war and peace. I am prepared to acquire wealth as well<br>as to earn virtue. I am fit enough for severity as for softness.'"
