                            "Narada said, 'Removed from his place and pushed away from his seat with<br>heart trembling in fear, and consumed by burning remorse, with his<br>garlands dimmed in lustre and his knowledge clouded, shorn of his crown<br>and bracelets, with head swimming and every limb relaxed divested of<br>ornaments and robes, incapable of being recognised, sometimes not seeing<br>the other residents of heaven, filled with despair, and his understanding<br>a perfect blank, king Yayati fell headlong towards the earth. And before<br>the king fell down, he thought within himself, 'What inauspicious and<br>sinful thought was entertained by me in consequence of which I am hurled<br>from my place?' And all the kings there, as also the Siddhas and the<br>Apsaras, laughed at seeing Yayati losing his hold, and on the point of<br>falling down. And soon, O king, at the command of the king of the gods,<br>there came a person whose business it was to hurl down those whose merits<br>were exhausted. And coming there, he said unto Yayati, 'Extremely<br>intoxicated with pride, there is none whom thou hast not disregarded. In<br>consequence of this thy pride, heaven is no longer for thee. Thou<br>deservest not a residence here, O son of a king. Thou art not recognised<br>here, go and fall down.' Even thus the celestial messenger spoke unto<br>him, Nahusha's son then said, repeating the words three times, 'If fall I<br>must, let me fall amongst the righteous.' And saying this, that foremost<br>of persons that had won high regions by their acts, began to think of the<br>particular region whereon he should fall. Beholding meanwhile four mighty<br>kings, viz., Pratardana, Vasumanas, Sivi, the son of Usinara, and<br>Ashtaka, assembled together in the woods of Naimisha, the king fell<br>amongst them. And those monarchs were then engaged in gratifying the lord<br>of the celestials by performance of the sacrifice known by the name of<br>Vajapeya. And the smoke arising from their sacrificial altar reached the<br>very gates of heaven. And the smoke that rose thus, looked like a river<br>connecting both the earth and the heaven. And it resembled the sacred<br>stream Ganga while descending from heaven to earth. And smelling that<br>smoke and guiding his course by it, Yayati, the lord of the universe,<br>descended on the earth. And the king thus fell amongst those four lions<br>among rulers, who were all endued with great beauty, who were foremost of<br>all the performers of sacrifices, who were, indeed, his own relatives,<br>and who resembled the four regents of the four quarters, and looked like<br>four mighty sacrificial fires. And thus, in consequence of the exhaustion<br>of his merits, the royal sage Yayati fell amongst them. And beholding him<br>blazing with beauty, those kings asked him, saying, "Who art thou? Of<br>what race, country, or city art thou? Art thou a Yaksha, or a god, a<br>Gandharva, or a Rakshasa? Thou does not seem to be a human being. What<br>object hast thou in view?' Thus questioned, Yayati answered, 'I am the<br>royal sage Yayati. Fallen am I from heaven in consequence of the<br>expiration of my virtue. Having desired to fall amongst the righteous, I<br>have fallen amongst you.' The kings then said, 'O foremost of persons,<br>may that wish of thine, be realized. Accept thou our virtues and the<br>fruits of all our sacrifices.' Yayati replied saying, 'I am not a<br>Brahmana competent to accept a gift. On the other hand, I am a Kshatriya.<br>Nor is my heart inclined towards lessening the virtues of others.'<br><br>"Narada continued, 'About this time, Madhavi, in course of her<br>purposeless wanderings, came there. Beholding her, those monarchs saluted<br>her and said, 'What object hast thou in coming here? What command of<br>thine shall we obey? Thou deservest to command us, for all of us are thy<br>sons, O thou that art endued with wealth of asceticism!' Hearing these<br>words of theirs, Madhavi was filled with delight and approaching then her<br>father, she reverentially saluted Yayati. And touching the heads of all<br>her sons, that lady engaged in ascetic austerities said to her father,<br>'Being my sons these all are thy daughter's sons, O king of kings. They<br>are not strangers to thee. These will save thee. The practice is not new,<br>its origin extends to antiquity. I am thy daughter Madhavi, O king,<br>living in the woods after the manner of the deer. I also have earned<br>virtue. Take thou a moiety. And because, O king, all men have a right to<br>enjoy a portion of the merits earned by their offspring, it is for this<br>that they desire to have daughter's sons. Even this was the case with<br>thyself, O king (when thou madest me over to Galava).' At these words of<br>their mother, those monarchs saluted her, and bowing down unto also their<br>maternal grandsire, repeated those very words in a loud, incomparable,<br>and sweet voice, and making, as it were, the whole earth resounded<br>therewith, in order to rescue that maternal grandsire of theirs who had<br>fallen down from heaven. And at that time Galava also came there, and<br>addressing Yayati, said, 'Accepting an eighth part of my ascetic<br>austerities, ascend thou to heaven again.'"
