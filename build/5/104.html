                            "Narada then said, 'This one is the charioteer of the name of Matali. He<br>is besides a dear friend of Sakra. Pure in conduct, he hath an excellent<br>disposition and possesses numerous virtues. Endued with strength of mind,<br>he hath great energy and great might. He is the friend, counsellor, and<br>charioteer of Sakra. It has been seen in every battle that small is the<br>difference that exists between him and Vasava as regards prowess and<br>strength. In all the battles between the gods and Asuras, it is this<br>Matali that driveth, by his mind alone, that ever-victorious and best of<br>cars belonging to Indra, which is drawn by thousand steeds. Vanquished by<br>his management of the steeds, the enemies of the gods are subjugated by<br>Vasava by the use of his hands. Defeated before-hand by Matali, the<br>Asuras are subsequently slain by Indra. Matali hath an excellent<br>daughter, who in beauty is unrivalled in the world. Truthful and<br>possessed of every accomplishment, she is known by the name of Gunakesi.<br>He was searching the three worlds for an eligible bridegroom. O thou that<br>art possessed of the splendour of a celestial, thy grandson, Sumukha,<br>hath become acceptable to him as a husband for his daughter. If O best of<br>serpents, his proposal be acceptable to thee, quickly make up thy mind, O<br>Aryaka, to take his daughter in gift for thy grandson. As Lakshmi in<br>Vishnu's house, or Swaha in that of Agni so let the slender-waisted<br>Gunakesi be a wife in thy race. Let Gunakesi, therefore be accepted by<br>thee for thy grandson, like Sachi for Vasava who deserveth her. Although<br>this youth hath lost his father, yet we choose him for his virtues, and<br>for the respectability of Airavata and thy own. Indeed, it is in<br>consequence of Sumukha's merits, his disposition, purity, self-restraint<br>and other qualifications that Matali hath become himself desirous of<br>giving away his daughter unto him. It behoveth thee, therefore, to honour<br>Matali.'<br><br>"Kanwa continued, 'Thus addressed by Narada, Aryaka beholding his<br>grandson elected as a bridegroom and remembering the death of his son was<br>filled with delight and sorrow at the same time. And he then addressed<br>Narada and said, 'How, O celestial Rishi, can I desire Gunakesi for a<br>daughter-in-law'! It cannot be, O great Rishi, that thy words are not<br>highly honoured by me, for who is there that would not desire an alliance<br>with the friend of Indra? I hesitate, however, O great Muni, in<br>consequence of the instability of the very cause that would not make that<br>alliance lasting. O thou of great effulgence, the author of this youth,<br>viz., my son, hath been devoured by Garuda. We are afflicted with sorrow<br>on that account. But worse still, O lord, Vinata's son, at the time of<br>leaving these regions, said, 'After a month I will devour this Sumukha<br>also. Surely, it will happen as he hath said, for we know with whom we<br>have to deal. At these words, therefore, of Suparna we have become<br>cheerless!'<br><br>"Kanwa continued, 'Matali then said unto Aryaka, 'I have formed a plan.<br>This thy grandson is elected by me as my son-in-law. Let this Naga then,<br>proceeding with me and Narada, come to the Lord of heaven the chief of<br>the celestials, O best of Nagas. I shall then endeavour to place<br>obstacles in the way of Suparna, and as a last resource, we will<br>ascertain the period of life that hath been vouchsafed to Sumukha.<br>Blessed be thou, O Naga, let Sumukha, therefore, come with me to the<br>presence of the Lord of the celestials.' Saying this, they took Sumukha<br>with them, and all the four, endued with great splendour, coming to<br>heaven beheld Sakra the chief of the gods seated in all his glory. And it<br>so happened that the illustrious Vishnu of four arms was also present<br>there. Narada then represented the whole story about Matali and his<br>choice.'<br><br>"Kanwa continued, 'Hearing all that Narada said, Vishnu directed<br>Purandara, the Lord of the universe, saying, 'Let Amrita be given to this<br>youth, and let him be made immortal like gods themselves. Let Matali, and<br>Narada, and Sumukha, O Vasava, all attain their cherished wish through<br>thy grace.' Purandara, however, reflecting on the prowess of Vinata's<br>son, said unto Vishnu, 'Let Amrita be given unto him by thee.' Thus<br>addressed, Vishnu said, 'Thou art the Lord of all mobile and immobile<br>creatures. Who is there, O lord, that would refuse a gift that may be<br>made by thee'?' At these words Sakra gave unto that Naga length of days.<br>The slayer of Vala and Vritra did not make him a drinker of Amrita.<br>Sumukha, having obtained that boon, became Sumukha[11] (in reality) for<br>his face was suffused with marks of joy. And having married Matali's<br>daughter, he cheerfully returned home. And Narada and Aryaka also filled<br>with delight at the success of their object, went away, after having<br>worshipped the glorious chief of the celestials.'"
