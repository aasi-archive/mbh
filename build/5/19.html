                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Then Yuyudhana, the great hero of the Satwata race,<br>came to Yudhishthira with a large army of foot, and horses and cars and<br>elephants. And his soldiers of great valour come from various lands, bore<br>various weapons of war, and heroic in look they beautified the Pandava<br>army. And that army looked splendid by reason of battleaxes, and missiles<br>and spears, and lances, and mallets, and clubs, and staves, and cords,<br>and stainless swords, and daggers, and arrows of various kinds, all of<br>the best temper. And the army, beautified by those weapons, and<br>resembling in colour the cloudy sky, assumed an appearance like to amass<br>of clouds with lightning-flashes in its midst. And the army counted an<br>Akshauhini of troops. And when absorbed in the troops of Yudhishthira it<br>entirely disappeared, as doth a small river when it enters the sea. And<br>similarly, the powerful chief of the Chedis, Dhrishtaketu, accompanied by<br>an Akshauhini, came to the sons of Pandu of immeasurable strength. And<br>the king of Magadha, Jayatsena of great strength, brought with him for<br>Yudhishthira an Akshauhini of troops. And similarly, Pandya, who dwelt on<br>the coast-land near the sea, came accompanied by troops of various kinds<br>to Yudhishthira, the king of kings. And, O king, when all these troops<br>had assembled, his army, finely dressed and exceedingly strong, assumed<br>an appearance pleasant to the eye. And the army of Drupada, also was<br>beautified by valiant soldiers who had come from various lands, and also<br>by his mighty sons. And similarly, Virata, the king of the Matsyas, a<br>leader of troops, accompanied by the king of the hilly regions, came to<br>Pandu's sons. And for the high-souled sons of Pandu there were thus<br>assembled from various directions, seven Akshauhini of troops, bristling<br>with banners of various forms. And eager to fight with the Kurus, they<br>gladdened the hearts of the Pandavas. And in the same way king<br>Bhagadatta, gladdening the heart of Dhritarashtra's son, gave an<br>Akshauhini of troops to him. And the unassailable mass of his troops,<br>crowded with Chins and Kiratas, all looking like figures of gold, assumed<br>a beauty like to that of a forest of Karnikara trees. And so the valiant<br>Bhurisravas, and Salya, O son of Kuru, came to Duryodhana, with an<br>Akshauhini of troops each. And Kritavarman, the son of Hridika,<br>accompanied by the Bhojas, the Andhas, and the Kukuras, came to<br>Duryodhana with an Akshauhini of troops. And the body of his troops<br>composed of those mighty soldiers, who wore on their persons garlands of<br>many-coloured flowers, looked as graceful as a number of sportive<br>elephants that have passed through a wood. And others led by Jayadratha,<br>the dwellers of the land of Sindhusauvira, came in such force that the<br>hills seemed to tremble under their tread. And their force, counting an<br>Akshauhini, looked like a mass of clouds moved by the wind. And<br>Sudakshina, the king of the Kambhojas, O ruler of men, accompanied by the<br>Yavanas and Sakas, came to the Kuru chief with an Akshauhini of troops.<br>And the body of his troops that looked like a flight of locusts, meeting<br>with the Kuru force, was absorbed and disappeared in it. And similarly<br>came king Nila, the resident of the city of the Mahishmati, with mighty<br>soldiers from the southern country who carried weapons of pretty make.<br>And the two kings of Avanti, accompanied by a mighty force, brought to<br>Duryodhana, each a separate Akshauhini of troops. And those tigers among<br>men, the five royal brothers, the princes of Kekaya, hastened to<br>Duryodhana with an Akshauhini of troops, and gladdened his heart. And<br>from the illustrious king, of other quarters there came, O best of<br>Bharata's race, three large divisions of troops. And thus Duryodhana had<br>a force which numbered eleven Akshauhinis all eager to fight with the<br>sons of Kunti, and bristling with banners of various forms. And, O<br>descendant of Bharata, there was no space in the city of Hastinapura even<br>for the principal leaders of Duryodhana's army. And for this reason the<br>land of the five rivers, and the whole of the region called Kurujangala,<br>and the forest of Rohitaka which was uniformly wild, and Ahichatra and<br>Kalakuta, and the banks of the Ganga, and Varana, and Vatadhana, and the<br>hill tracts on the border of the Yamuna&#8212;the whole of this extensive<br>tract&#8212;full of abundant corn and wealth, was entirely overspread with the<br>army of the Kauravas. And that army, so arranged, was beheld by the<br>priest who had been sent by the king of the Panchalas to the Kurus.'"
