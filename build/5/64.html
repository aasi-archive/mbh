                            "Vidura said, 'We have heard, O sire, from old men, that once on a time a<br>fowler spread his net on the ground for catching feathery denizens of the<br>air. And in that net were ensnared at the same time two birds that lived<br>together. And taking the net up, the two winged creatures soared together<br>into the air. And seeing them soar into the sky, the fowler, without<br>giving way to despair, began to follow them in the direction they flew,<br>Just then, an ascetic living in a hermitage (close by), who had finished<br>his morning prayers, saw the fowler running in that manner hoping still<br>to secure the feathery creatures. And seeing that tenant of the earth<br>quickly pursuing those tenants of the air, the ascetic, O Kaurava,<br>addressed him in this Sloka,&#8212;O fowler, it appears very strange and<br>wonderful to me that thou, that art a treader of the earth, pursuest yet<br>a couple of creatures that are tenants of the air. The fowler said,<br>'These two, united together, are taking away my snare. There, however,<br>where they will quarrel they will come under my control.'<br><br>"Vidura continued, 'The two birds, doomed to death, soon after<br>quarrelled. And when the foolish pair quarrelled, they both fell on the<br>earth. And when, ensnared in the meshes of death, they began to contend<br>angrily against each other, the fowler approached unperceived and sized<br>them both. Even thus those kinsmen who fall out with one another for the<br>sake of wealth fall into the hands of the enemy like the birds I have<br>cited, in consequence of their quarrel. Eating together, talking<br>together,&#8212;these are the duties of kinsmen, and not contention under any<br>circumstances. Those kinsmen, that with loving hearts wait on the old,<br>become unconquerable like a forest guarded by lions. While those, O bull<br>of the Bharata race, that having won enormous riches nevertheless, behave<br>like mean-minded men, always contribute to the prosperity of their foes.<br>Kinsmen, O Dhritarashtra, O bull of the Bharata race, are like charred<br>brands, which blaze up when united but only smoke when disunited. I will<br>now tell thee something else that I saw on a mountain-breast. Having<br>listened to that also, do, O Kaurava, what is for thy best. Once on a<br>time we repaired to the northern mountain, accompanied by some hunters<br>and a number of Brahmanas, fond of discoursing on charms and medicinal<br>plants. That northern mountain, Gandhamadana, looked like a grove. As its<br>breast was overgrown on all sides with trees and diverse kinds of<br>luminous medicinal herbs, it was inhabited by Siddhas and Gandharvas. And<br>there we all saw a quantity of honey, of a bright yellow colour and of<br>the measure of a jar, placed on an inaccessible precipice of the<br>mountain. That honey, which was Kuvera's favourite drink, was guarded by<br>snakes of virulent poison. And it was such that a mortal, drinking of it<br>would win immortality, a sightless man obtain sight, and an old man would<br>become a youth. It was that those Brahmanas conversant with sorcery spoke<br>about that honey. And the hunters' seeing that honey, desired, O king, to<br>obtain it. And they all perished in that inaccessible mountain-cave<br>abounding with snakes. In the same way, this thy son desireth to enjoy<br>the whole earth without a rival. He beholdeth the honey, but seeth not,<br>from folly, the terrible fall. It is true, Duryodhana desireth an<br>encounter in battle with Savyasachin, but I do not see that energy or<br>prowess in him which may carry him safe through it. On a single car<br>Arjuna conquered the whole earth. At the head of their hosts Bhishma and<br>Drona and others were frightened by Arjuna and utterly routed at the city<br>of Virata. Remember what took place on that occasion. He forgiveth still,<br>looking up to thy face and waiting to know what thou wouldst do. Drupada,<br>and the king of Matsyas, and Dhananjaya, when angry, will, like flames of<br>fire urged by the wind, leave no remnant (of thy army). O Dhritarashtra,<br>take king Yudhishthira on thy lap since both parties can, under no<br>circumstances, have victory when thy will be engaged in battle.'"
