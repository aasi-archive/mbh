                            "Bhishma said, 'Drupada, O chastiser of foes, bestowed great attention on<br>everything in connection with that daughter of his, teaching her writing<br>and painting and all the arts. And in arrows and weapons that child<br>became a disciple of Drona. And the child's mother, of superior<br>complexion, then urged the king (her husband) to find, O monarch, a wife<br>for her, as if she were a son. Then Prishata, beholding that daughter of<br>his to have attained the full development of youth and assured of her sex<br>began to consult with his queen. And Drupada said, 'This daughter of mine<br>that so enhanceth my woe, hath attained her youth. Concealed, however,<br>she hath hitherto been by me at the words of the trident-bearing deity!'<br>The queen replied, 'That, O great king, can never be untrue! Why, indeed,<br>would the Lord of the three worlds say that would not occur? If it<br>pleases thee, O king, I will speak, and listen to my words, and, O son of<br>Prishata's race, having listened to me, follow thy own inclination! Let<br>the wedding of this child with a wife be caused to be performed<br>carefully. The words of that god will be true. This is my certain<br>belief!' Then that royal couple, having settled their resolution of that<br>affair, chose the daughter of the king of the Dasarnakas as their son's<br>wife. After this, the royal Drupada, that lion among kings, having<br>enquired about the purity of descent, of all the rulers of the earth,<br>selected the daughter of the king of Dasarnakas for wife to Sikhandin.<br>He, who was called the king of the Dasarnakas was named Hiranyavarman;<br>and he gave away his daughter to Sikhandin. And Hiranyavarman, the king<br>of the Dasarnakas, was a powerful monarch, incapable of being easily<br>vanquished. Incapable of being resisted, that high-souled monarch<br>possessed a large army. And sometimes after the wedding, the daughter of<br>Hiranyavarman, O best of monarchs, attained her youth while the daughter<br>of Drupada also had attained hers. And Sikhandin, after marriage, came<br>back to Kampilya. And the former soon came to know that the latter was a<br>woman like herself. And the daughter of Hiranyavarman, having ascertained<br>that Sikhandin was really a woman, bashfully represented unto her nurses<br>and companions everything about the so-called son of the king of the<br>Panchalas. Then, O tiger among kings, those nurses of the Dasarnakas<br>country were filled with great grief and sent emissaries unto their king.<br>And those emissaries represented unto the king of the Dasarnakas<br>everything about the imposture that had taken place. And, thereupon, the<br>king of the Dasarnakas was filled with wrath. Indeed, O bull of the<br>Bharata race, Hiranyavarman, hearing the news after the expiry of a few<br>days was much afflicted with wrath. The ruler of the Dasarnakas then,<br>filled with fierce wrath, sent a messenger to Drupada's abode. And the<br>messenger of king Hiranyavarman, having alone approached Drupada, took<br>him aside and said unto him in private, 'The king of the Dasarnakas, O<br>monarch, deceived by thee and enraged, O sinless one, at the insult thou<br>hast offered him, hath said these words unto thee,&#8212;Thou hast humiliated<br>me! Without doubt it was not wisely done by thee! Thou hadst, from folly,<br>solicited my daughter for thy daughter! O wicked one, reap now the<br>consequence of that act of deception' I will now slay thee with all thy<br>relatives and advisers! Wait a little!'"
