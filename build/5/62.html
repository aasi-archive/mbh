                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Without much minding Dhritarashtra, the son of<br>Vichitravirya who was about to ask of Partha, Karna said unto<br>Dhritarashtra's son these words, cheering up the spirit of the assembled<br>Kurus, 'Coming to know of the false pretence under which I obtained the<br>Brahma weapon of old from Rama, the latter told me,&#8212;When thy hour will<br>come thy memory will fail thee in respect of this weapon. Even for so<br>great an offence I was cursed so lightly by that great Rishi, my<br>preceptor. That great Rishi of fierce energy is capable of consuming even<br>the entire Earth with her seas. By attention and personal bravery, I<br>appeased his heart. I have that weapon with me still, and my period is<br>not yet run. I am, therefore, fully competent (to win victory) Let the<br>responsibility be mine. Having obtained the favour of that Rishi, I will<br>slay within the twinkling of an eye the Panchalas, the Karushas, the<br>Matsyas, and the sons of Pritha with their sons and grandsons, and bestow<br>on thee numerous regions won by my weapons. Let the Grandsire and Drona<br>and all the kings stay with thee. I will slay the sons of Pritha,<br>marching forth with the chief warriors of my army. Let that task be<br>mine.' Unto him speaking thus, Bhishma said, 'What sayest thou, O Karna?<br>Thy intellect is clouded at the approach of thy hour. Knowest thou not, O<br>Karna, that when the chief is slain, the sons of Dhritarashtra will all<br>be slain? Having heard of the feat achieved by Dhananjaya, with Krishna<br>only as his ally, at the burning of the Khandava forest, it behoveth thee<br>with thy friends and relatives to restrain thy mind. The shaft that the<br>illustrious and adorable chief of the celestials, the great Indra, gave<br>thee, thou wilt see, will be broken and reduced to ashes when struck by<br>Kesava with his discus. That other shaft of serpentine mouth that shineth<br>(in thy quiver) and is respectfully worshipped by thee with flowery<br>garlands, will, O Karna, when struck by the son of Pandu with his shafts,<br>perish with thee. O Karna, the slayer of Vana and Bhumi's son (Naraka),<br>Vasudeva himself, who hath, in the thickest of battle, slain foes equal<br>and even superior to thee, protecteth the diadem-decked Arjuna'.<br><br>"Karna said, 'Without doubt, the chief of the Vrishnis is even so.<br>Further, I admit, that that high-souled one is even more than that. Let,<br>however, the Grandsire listen to the effect of the bit of harsh speech<br>that he hath uttered. I lay down my weapons. The Grandsire will<br>henceforth behold me in court only and not in battle. After thou hast<br>become quiet, the rulers of the earth will behold my prowess in this<br>world.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said this, that great bowman (Karna),<br>leaving the court went to his own abode. Bhishma, however, O king,<br>addressing Duryodhana in the midst of the Kurus, and laughing aloud,<br>said, 'How truly doth the Suta's son keep his promise. Why having<br>repeatedly given his pledge, saying,&#8212;The kings of Avanti and Kalinga,<br>Jayadratha, and Chediddhaja and Valhika standing as spectators, I will<br>slay hostile warriors by thousands and tens of thousands,&#8212;how will he<br>discharge that obligation? Having distributed his divisions in<br>counter-array and scattering heads by thousands, behold the havoc<br>committed by Bhimasena. Indeed, that moment, when, representing himself<br>as a Brahmana unto the holy and blameless Rama, Vikartana's son obtained<br>that weapon, that vile wretch lost both his virtue and asceticism.' O<br>king of kings, when Bhishma said this after Karna had gone away giving up<br>his weapons, Duryodhana, that foolish son of Vichitravirya's son,<br>addressed Santanu's son in these words.'"
