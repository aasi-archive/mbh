                            "Sanjaya said, 'I did thee farewell, O divine ruler of men. I will now<br>depart, O son of Pandu. Let prosperity be thine. I hope, I have not<br>carried away by the feelings of my heart, given utterance to anything<br>offensive. I would also bid farewell to Janardana, to Bhima and Arjuna,<br>to the son of Madri, to Satyaki, and to Chekitana, and take my departure.<br>Let peace and happiness be yours. Let all the kings look at me with eyes<br>of affection.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Permitted by us, O Sanjaya, take your leave. Peace<br>to thee! O learned man, thou never thinkest ill of us. Both they and we<br>know thee to be a person of pure heart in the midst of all in the court<br>(of the Kurus). Besides, being an ambassador now, O Sanjaya, thou art<br>faithful, beloved by us, of agreeable speech and excellent conduct, and<br>well-affected towards us. Thy mind is never clouded, and even if<br>addressed harshly thou art never moved to wrath. O Suta, thou never<br>utterest harsh and cutting words, or those that are false or bitter. We<br>know that thy words, free from malice, are always fraught with morality<br>and grave import. Amongst envoys thou art the most dear to us. Beside<br>thee, there is another, who may come here, and that is Vidura. Formerly,<br>we always used to see thee. Thou art, indeed, a friend to us as dear as<br>Dhananjaya. Proceeding hence, O Sanjaya, with all speed, thou shouldst<br>wait upon those Brahmanas of pure energy and devoted to study according<br>to the Brahmacharya mode,&#8212;those, namely, that are devoted to the study<br>of the Vedas while leading lives of mendicancy, those ascetics that<br>habitually dwell in the woods, as also the aged ones of other classes,<br>should all be addressed by thee in my name, O Sanjaya, and then their<br>welfare should be enquired into by thee. O Suta, repairing unto the<br>priest of king Dhritarashtra as also unto his preceptors and Ritwijas,<br>thou shouldst address them and enquire after their welfare. Even amongst<br>them that are, though not well-born at least aged, endued with energy,<br>and possessed of good behaviour and strength, who remembering speak of us<br>and practise according to their might even the least virtue, should first<br>be informed of my peace, O Sanjaya, and then shouldst thou enquire after<br>their welfare. Thou shouldst also enquire after the welfare of those that<br>live in the kingdom carrying on trade, and those that live there filling<br>important offices of state. Our beloved preceptor Drona, who is fully<br>versed in morality, who is our counsellor, who had practised the<br>Brahmacharya vow for mastering the Vedas, who once again hath made the<br>science of weapons full and complete, and who is always graciously<br>inclined towards us, should be greeted by thee in our name. Thou shouldst<br>also enquire into the welfare of Aswatthaman, endued with great learning,<br>devoted to the study of the Vedas, leading the Brahmacharya mode of life,<br>possessed of great activity, and like unto a youth of the Gandharva race,<br>and who, besides, hath once again made the science of weapons full and<br>complete. Thou must also, O Sanjaya, repair to the abode of Kripa, the<br>son of Saradwat, that mighty car-warrior and foremost of all persons<br>having a knowledge of self, and repeatedly saluting him in my name touch<br>his feet with thy hand. Thou shouldst also, touching his feet, represent<br>me as hale unto that foremost of the Kurus, Bhishma, in whom are combined<br>bravery, and abstention from injury, and asceticism, and wisdom and good<br>behaviour, and Vedic learning, and great excellence, and firmness.<br>Saluting unto also the wise, venerable, and blind king (Dhritarashtra),<br>who possessed of great learning and reverential to the old, is the leader<br>of the Kurus. Thou shouldst also, O Sanjaya, enquire, O sire, about the<br>welfare of the eldest of Dhritarashtra's sons, Suyodhana, who is wicked<br>and ignorant and deceitful and vicious, and who now governs the entire<br>world. Thou shouldst also enquire about the welfare of even the wicked<br>Dussasana, that mighty bowman and hero among the Kurus, who is the<br>younger of Duryodhana and who possesses a character like that of his<br>elder brother. Thou shouldst, O Sanjaya, also salute the wise chief of<br>the Vahlikas, who always cherishes no other wish save that there should<br>be peace among the Bharatas. I think, thou shouldst also worship that<br>Somadatta who is endued with numerous excellent qualities, who is wise<br>and possesses a merciful heart, and who from his affection for the Kurus<br>always controls his anger towards them. The son of Somadatta is worthy of<br>the greatest reverence among the Kurus. He is my friend and is a brother<br>to us. A mighty bowman and the foremost of car-warriors, he is worthy in<br>all respects. Thou shouldst, O Sanjaya, enquire after his welfare along<br>with that of his friends and counsellors. Others there are of youthful<br>age and of consideration amongst the Kurus, who bear a relationship to us<br>like that of sons, grandsons, and brothers. Unto each of these thou must<br>speak words which thou mayst consider suitable, enquiring, O Suta, after<br>his welfare. Thou must also enquire about the welfare of those kings that<br>have been assembled by Dhritarashtra's son for fighting with the<br>Pandavas, viz., the Kekayas, the Vasatis, the Salwakas, the Amvashthas,<br>and the leading Trigartas, and of those endued with great bravery that<br>have come from the east, the north, the south, and the west, and of those<br>that have come from hilly countries, in fact, of all amongst them that<br>are not cruel and that lead good lives. Thou shouldst also represent unto<br>all those persons who ride on elephants, and horses and cars, and who<br>fight on foot,&#8212;that mighty host composed of honourable men,&#8212;that I am<br>well, and then thou must enquire about their own welfare. Thou must also<br>enquire about the welfare of those that serve the king in the matter of<br>his revenue or as his door-keepers, or as the leaders of his troops, or<br>as the accountants of his income and outlay, or as officers constantly<br>occupied in looking after other important concerns. Thou must, O sire,<br>also enquire about the welfare of Dhritarashtra's son by his Vaisya<br>wife,&#8212;that youth who is one of the best of the Kuru race,&#8212;who never<br>falls into error, who possesseth vast wisdom, who is endued with every<br>virtue, and who never cherishes a liking for this war! Thou shouldst also<br>ask about the welfare of Chitrasena who is unrivalled in the tricks of<br>dice, whose tricks are never detected by others, who plays well, who is<br>well-versed in the art of handling the dice, and who is unconquerable in<br>play but not in fight. Thou must also, O sire, enquire about the welfare<br>of Sakuni, the king of the Gandharas, that native of the hilly country,<br>who is unrivalled in deceitful games at dice, who enhances the pride of<br>Dhritarashtra's son, and whose understanding naturally leads to<br>falsehood. Thou must also enquire about the welfare of Karna, the son of<br>Vikartana, that hero who is ready to vanquish, alone and unassisted,<br>mounted on his car, the Pandavas whom no one dares assail in battle, that<br>Karna who is unparalleled in deluding those that are already deluded.<br>Thou must also enquire about the welfare of Vidura, O sire, who alone is<br>devoted to us, who is our instructor, who reared us, who is our father<br>and mother and friend, whose understanding finds obstruction in nought,<br>whose ken reaches far, and who is our counsellor. Thou must also salute<br>all the aged dames and those who are known to be possessed of merit, and<br>those who are like mothers to us, meeting them gathered together in one<br>place. Thou must tell them, O Sanjaya, these words at first,&#8212;Ye mothers<br>of living sons, I hope, your sons comfort themselves towards you in a<br>kindly, considerate, and worthy way.&#8212;Thou must then tell them that<br>Yudhishthira is doing well with his sons. Those ladies, O Sanjaya, who<br>are in the rank of our wives, thou must ask as to their welfare also<br>addressing them in these words,&#8212;I hope, you are well-protected. I hope,<br>your fair fame hath suffered no injury. I hope, you are dwelling within<br>your abodes blamelessly and carefully. I hope, you are comforting<br>yourselves towards your fathers-in-law in a kindly, praise-worthy and<br>considerate way. You must steadily adopt such a conduct for yourselves as<br>will help you to win your husband's favour! Those young ladies, O<br>Sanjaya, who bear a relationship to us like that of your<br>daughters-in-law, who have been brought from high families, who are<br>possessed of merit and who are mothers of children,&#8212;thou must meet them<br>all and tell them that Yudhishthira send his kindly greetings to them.<br>Thou must, O Sanjaya, embrace the daughters of your house, and must ask<br>them about their welfare on my behalf. Thou must tell them,&#8212;May your<br>husbands be kindly and agreeable; may you be agreeable to your husbands;<br>may you have ornaments and clothes and perfumery and cleanliness; may you<br>be happy and have at your command the joys of life; may your looks be<br>pretty and words pleasant; Thou must ask, O sire, the women of the house<br>as to their welfare. Thou must also represent unto the maid-servants and<br>man-servants there, may be of the Kurus, and also the many humpbacked and<br>lame ones among them, that I am doing well, and thou must then ask them<br>about their welfare. Thou must tell them,&#8212;I hope, Dhritarashtra's son<br>still vouchsafes the same kindly treatment to you. I hope, he gives you<br>the comforts of life.&#8212;Thou must also represent unto those that are<br>defective in limb, those that are imbecile, the dwarfs to whom<br>Dhritarashtra gives food and raiment from motives of humanity, those that<br>are blind, and all those that are aged, as also to the many that have the<br>use only of their hands being destitute of legs, that I am doing well,<br>and that I ask them regarding their welfare, addressing them in the<br>following words,&#8212;Fear not, nor be dispirited on account of your unhappy<br>lives so full of sufferings; no doubt, sins must have been committed by<br>you in your former lives. When I shall check my foes, and delight my<br>friends, I shall satisfy you by gifts of food and clothes.&#8212;Thou shouldst<br>also, O sire, at our request, enquire after the welfare of those that are<br>masterless and weak, and of those that vainly strive to earn a living,<br>and of those that are ignorant, in fact, of all those persons that are in<br>pitiable circumstances. O charioteer, meeting those others, that coming<br>from different quarters, have sought the protection of the<br>Dhritarashtras, and in fact, all who deserve our greetings, thou shouldst<br>also enquire about their welfare and peace. Thou shouldst also enquire<br>about the welfare of those who have come to the Kurus of their own accord<br>or who have been invited, as also of all the ambassadors arrived from all<br>sides and then represent unto them that I am well. As regards the<br>warriors that have been obtained by Dhritarashtra's son, there are none<br>equal to them on earth. Virtue, however, is eternal, and virtue is my<br>power for the destruction of my enemies. Thou shouldst, O Sanjaya, also<br>represent unto Suyodhana, the son of Dhritarashtra, the following,&#8212;That<br>desire of thine which torments thy heart, viz., the desire of ruling the<br>Kurus without a rival, is very unreasonable. It had no justification. As<br>for ourselves, we will never act in such a way as to do anything that may<br>be disagreeable to thee! O foremost of heroes anwng the Bharatas, either<br>give me lack my own Indraprastha or fight with me!'"
