                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Rising up (from his bed) at day-dawn, Krishna went<br>through his morning rites, and taking leave of the Bharatas, set out for<br>the city (of the Kurus). Ana all the inhabitants of Vrikasthala, bidding<br>farewell unto that mighty one of long arms while he was about to depart,<br>all returned to their homes. And all the Dhartarashtras except<br>Duryodhana, attired in excellent robes, and with Bhishma, Drona, Kripa,<br>and others, went out to meet him. And the citizens by thousands, O king,<br>on cars of diverse kinds, and many on foot, also came out, desirous of<br>beholding Hrishikesa. And meeting on the way Bhishma of spotless deed,<br>and Drona, and Dhritarashtra's sons, he entered the city, surrounded by<br>them all. And in honour of Krishna, the city was beautifully adorned, and<br>the principal streets were decorated with diverse jewels and gems. And, O<br>king, O bull of the Bharata race, on that occasion no one,&#8212;man, woman,<br>or child,&#8212;remained in doors, so eager were the citizens for beholding<br>Vasudeva. And all the citizens came out and lined the streets and bent<br>their heads down to the ground singing eulogies in his honour, O king,<br>when Hrishikesa entered the city and passed through it. And substantial<br>mansions, filled with high-born ladies, seemed to be on the point of<br>falling down on the ground in consequence of their living weight. And<br>although Vasudeva's steeds were endued with great speed, yet they moved<br>very slowly through that dense mass of human beings. And that lotus-eyed<br>grinder of foes then entered Dhritarashtra's ash-coloured palace which<br>was enriched with numerous buildings. And having passed through the first<br>three chambers of the palace, that chastiser of foes, Kesava, came upon<br>the royal son of Vichitravirya. And upon that son of Dasarha's race<br>approaching his presence, the blind monarch of great fame stood up along<br>with Drona and Bhishma, Kripa and Somadatta, and king Vahlika also,&#8212;all<br>stood up for honouring Janardana. And the Vrishni hero, having approached<br>king Dhritarashtra of great fame, worshipped him and Bhishma with proper<br>words and without losing any time. And having offered that worship unto<br>them according to established usage, Madhava the slayer of Madhu, greeted<br>the other kings according to their seniority in years. And Janardana then<br>accosted the illustrious Drona and his son, and Vahlika, and Kripa, and<br>Somadatta. And there in that chamber Jay a spacious seat of beautiful<br>workmanship, made of gold and set with jewels. And at Dhritarashtra's<br>request, Achyuta took that seat; and the priests of Dhritarashtra duly<br>offered Janardana a cow, honey and curds and water. And after the rites<br>of hospitality were over, Govinda remained there for a while, surrounded<br>by the Kurus, laughing and jesting with them according to their<br>relationship with him. And that illustrious grinder of foes, honoured and<br>worshipped by Dhritarashtra, came out with the king's permission. And<br>Madhava having duly greeted all the Kurus in their assembly, then went to<br>the delightful abode of Vidura; and Vidura, having approached Janardana<br>of Dasarha's race thus arrived at his abode, worshipped him with every<br>auspicious and desirable offering. And he said, 'What use, O lotus-eyed<br>one, in telling thee of the joy I feel at this advent of thine, for thou<br>art the inner Soul of all embodied creatures.' And after the hospitable<br>reception was over, Vidura, conversant with all the principles of<br>morality, enquired of Govinda, the slayer of Madhu, about the welfare of<br>Pandavas. And that scion of Dasarha's race, that chief of the Vrishnis,<br>unto whom the past and the future were as the present, knowing that<br>Vidura was loved by the Pandavas and friendly towards them, and learned,<br>and firm in morality, and honest, and harbouring no wrath (against the<br>Pandavas), and wise, began to tell him everything in detail about the<br>doings of the sons of Pandu.'"
