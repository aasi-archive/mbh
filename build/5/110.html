                            "Garuda said, 'This quarter is the favourite one of king Varuna, the<br>ruler of the ocean. Indeed, the lord of the waters had his origin here,<br>and it is hither that sovereignty lieth. And since it is here that<br>towards the day's end (paschat) the sun dismisseth his rays that this<br>quarter, O best of the twice-born ones, is called the west (paschima).<br>For ruling over all aquatic creatures and for the protection of the water<br>themselves, illustrious and divine Kasyapa installed Varuna here (as the<br>king of this region). Quaffing all the six juices of Varuna, the moon,<br>the dispeller of darkness, becometh young again in the beginning of the<br>fortnight. It was in the quarter, O Brahmana, that the Daityas were<br>routed and bound fast by the wind-god. And afflicted by a mighty tempest,<br>and breathing hard (as they fled), they at last laid themselves down in<br>this region to sleep (the sleep that knows no waking). Hither is that<br>mountain called Asta which is the cause of the evening twilight, and<br>which (daily) receiveth the sun lovingly turning towards it. It is from<br>this quarter that both Night and Sleep, issuing out at the close of day,<br>spread themselves, as if, for robbing all living creatures of half their<br>allotted periods of life. It was here that Sakra, beholding (his<br>stepmother) the goddess Diti lying asleep in a state of pregnancy, cut<br>off the foetus (into forty-nine parts), whence sprang the (forty-nine)<br>Maruts. It is towards this direction that the roots of Himavat stretch<br>towards the eternal Mandara (sunk in the ocean). By journeying for even a<br>thousand years one cannot attain to the end of those roots. It is in this<br>region that Surabhi (the mother of cows), repairing to the shores of the<br>extensive lake, adorned with golden lotuses, poureth forth her milk. Here<br>in the midst of the ocean is seen the headless trunk of the illustrious<br>Swarbhanu (Rahu) who is always bent upon devouring both sun and the moon.<br>Here is heard the loud chanting of the Vedas by Suvarnasiras, who is<br>invincible and of immeasurable energy, and whose hair is eternally green.<br>It is in this region that the daughter of Muni Harimedhas remained<br>transfixed in the welkin in consequence of Surya's injunction couched in<br>the words&#8212;Stop, Stop. Here, O Galava, wind, and fire, and earth, and<br>water, are all free, both day and night, from their painful sensations.<br>It is from this region that the sun's course begins to deviate from the<br>straight path, and it is in this direction that all the luminous bodies<br>(the constellations) enter the solar sphere. And having moved for<br>twenty-eight nights with the sun, they come out of the sun's course to<br>move in accompaniment with the moon. It is in this region that the rivers<br>which always feed the ocean have their sources. Here, in the abode of<br>Varuna, are the waters of the three worlds. In this region is situate the<br>abode of Anarta, the prince of snakes. And here is the unrivalled abode<br>also of Vishnu, who is without beginning and without end. In this region<br>is also situate the abode of the great Rishi Kasyapa, the son of Maricha.<br>The western quarter is thus narrated to thee in course of telling thee of<br>the different points. Tell me now, O Galava, towards which side, O best<br>of regenerate persons, shall we go?'"
