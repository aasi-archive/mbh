                            "Narada said, 'Galava then, addressing Madhavi, said, The ruler of the<br>Kasis is an illustrious king known by the name of Divodasa. He is the son<br>of Bhimasena, is endued with great prowess, and is a mighty sovereign. O<br>blessed maiden, we are now going to him. Follow me slowly and grieve not.<br>That ruler of men is virtuous and devoted to truth and hath his passions<br>under control.'<br><br>"Narada Continued, 'When the muni came before that king he was received<br>with due hospitality by the latter. Galava, then, began to urge the<br>monarch for begetting a child. Thus addressed, Divodasa said, 'I heard of<br>all this before. Thou needest not speak much. O Brahmana. I may tell<br>thee, O best of Brahmanas, that as soon as I heard of this matter, my<br>heart was set upon it. This also is a mark of great honour to me that<br>passing over all other kings thou hast come to me, Without doubt, thy<br>object will be gained. In the matter of the steeds, O Galava, my wealth<br>is like that of king Haryyaswa. I shall, therefore, beget only one royal<br>son upon this maiden.' Hearing these words, that best of Brahmanas gave<br>that damsel unto the king, and, the king, thereupon, duly wedded her. And<br>the royal sage then sported with her, as Surya with Prabhavati, Agni with<br>Swaha, Vasava with Sachi, Chandra with Rohini, Yama with Urmila, Varuna<br>with Gauri, Kuvera with Riddhi, Narayana with Lakshmi, Sagara with<br>Jahnavi, Rudra with Rudrani, the Grandsire with Saraswati, Vasishtha's<br>son Saktri with Adrisyanti, Vasishtha with Arundhati (called also<br>Akshamala), Chyavana with Sukanya, Pulastya with Sandhya, Agastya with<br>the princess of Vidarbha Lopamudra, Satyavan with Savitri, Bhrigu with<br>Puloma, Kasyapa with Aditi, Richika's son Jamadagni with Renuka, Kusika's<br>son Viswamitra with Himavati, Vrihaspati with Tara, Sukra with Sataprava,<br>Bhumipati with Bhumi, Pururavas with Urvasi, Richika with Satyavati, Manu<br>with Saraswati, Dushyanta with Sakuntala, the eternal Dharma with Dhriti,<br>Nala with Damayanti, Narada, with Satyavati, Jaratkaru with Jaratkaru,<br>Pulastya with Pratichya, Urnayus with Menaka, Tumvuru with Rambha, Vasuki<br>with Satasirsha, Dhananjaya with Kamari, Rama with the princess of Videha<br>Sita, or Janardana with Rukmini. And unto king Divodasa, that sporting<br>with and taking delight in her, Madhavi bore a son named Pratardana. And<br>after she had borne him a son, the holy Galava came to Divodasa at the<br>appointed time, and said unto him, 'Let the maiden come with me, and let<br>the steeds also thou art to give me remain with thee, for I desire to go<br>elsewhere, O ruler of Earth, for dower.' Thus addressed, the virtuous<br>king Divodasa, who was devoted to truth, thereupon, gave back the maiden<br>to Galava at the appointed time.'"
