                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Meanwhile, understanding from his spies that the<br>slayer of Madhu had set out, Dhritarashtra, with his hair standing erect,<br>respectfully addressing the mighty-armed Bhishma and Dorna and Sanjaya<br>and the illustrious Vidura, said these words unto Duryodhana and his<br>counsellors, 'O scion of Kuru's race, strange and wonderful is the news<br>that we hear. Men, women and children, are talking of it. Others are<br>speaking of it respectfully, and others again assembled together. Within<br>houses where men congregate and in open spots, people and discussing it.<br>All say that Dasarha of great prowess will come hither for the sake of<br>Pandavas. The slayer of Madhu is, by all means, deserving of honour and<br>worship at our hands. He is the Lord of all creatures, and on him resteth<br>the course of every thing in the universe. Indeed, intelligence and<br>prowess and wisdom and energy, all reside in Madhava. Worthy of honour at<br>the hands of all righteous persons he is the foremost of all men, and is,<br>indeed, eternal Virtue. If worshipped he is sure to bestow happiness; and<br>if not worshipped fie is sure to inflict misery. If that smiter of foes,<br>Dasarha be gratified with our offerings, all our wishes may be obtained<br>by us, through his grace, in the midst of the kings. O chastiser of foes,<br>make without loss of time every arrangement for his reception. Let<br>pavilions be set up on the road, furnished with every object of<br>enjoyment. O mighty-armed son of Gandhari, make such arrangements that he<br>may be gratified with thee. What doth Bhishma think in this matter?' At<br>this, Bhishma and others, all applauding those words of king<br>Dhritarashtra, said,&#8212;'Excellent.' King Duryodhana then, understanding<br>their wishes, ordered delightful sites to be chosen for the erection of<br>pavilions. Many pavilions were thereupon constructed abounding with gems<br>of every kind, at proper intervals and at delightful spots. And the king<br>sent thither handsome seats endued with excellent qualities, beautiful<br>girls, and scents and ornaments, and fine robes, and excellent viands,<br>and drink of diverse qualities, and fragrant garlands of many kinds. And<br>the king of the Kurus took especial care to erect, for the reception of<br>Krishna, a highly beautiful pavilion at Vrikasthala, full of precious<br>gems. And having made all these arrangements that were god-like and much<br>above the capacity of human beings, king Duryodhana informed<br>Dhritarashtra of the same. Kesava, however, of Dasarha's race, arrived at<br>the capital of the Kurus, without casting a single glance at all those<br>pavilions and all those gems of diverse kinds.'"
