                            "Garuda continued, 'In days of yore, Vivaswat, having performed a<br>sacrifice, gave this quarter away as a present (Dakshina) unto his<br>preceptor, And it is for this that this region is known by the name of<br>Dakshina (south). It is here that the Pitris of the three worlds have<br>their habitation. And, O Brahmana, it is said that a class of celestials<br>subsisting upon smoke alone also live there. Those celestials also that<br>go by the name of Viswedevas always dwell in this region along with the<br>Pitris. Worshipped in sacrifices in all the worlds, they are equal<br>sharers with the Pitris. This quarter is called the second door of Yama.<br>It is here that the periods allotted to men are calculated in Trutis and<br>Lavas.[15] In this region always dwell the celestial Rishis, the<br>Pitriloka Rishis, and the royal Rishis, in great happiness. Here are<br>religion and truth. It is here that the acts (of persons) exhibit their<br>fruits. This region, O best of the twice-born, is the goal of the acts of<br>the dead. It is this region, O best of regenerate persons, whither all<br>must repair. And as creatures are all overwhelmed by darkness, they<br>cannot, therefore, come hither in bliss. Here, O bull among regenerate<br>persons, are many thousands of Malevolent Rakshasas in order to be seen<br>by the sinful. Here, O Brahmana, in the bowers on the breast of Mandara<br>and in the abodes of regenerate Rishis, the Gandharvas chant psalms,<br>stealing away both the heart and the intellect. It was here that Raivata<br>(a Daitya), hearing the Sama hymns sung in a sweet voice, retired to the<br>woods, leaving his wife and friends and kingdom. In this region, O<br>Brahmana, Manu and Yavakrita's son together set a limit which Surya can<br>never overstep. It was here that the illustrious descendant of Pulastya,<br>Ravana, the king of the Rakshasas, undergoing ascetic austerities,<br>solicited (the boon of) immortality from the gods. It was here that (the<br>Asura) Vritra, in consequence of his wicked conduct, incurred the enmity<br>of Sakra. It is in this region that lives of diverse forms all come and<br>are then dissociated into their five (constituent) elements. It is in<br>this region, O Galava, that men of wicked deeds rot (in tortures). It is<br>here that the river Vaitarani flows, filled with the bodies of persons<br>condemned to hell. Arrived here, persons attain to the extremes of<br>happiness and misery. Reaching this region, the sun droppeth sweet waters<br>and thence proceeding again to the direction named after (Vasishtha),<br>once more droppeth dew, It was here that I once obtained (for food), a<br>prodigious elephant battling with an enormous tortoise. It was here that<br>the great sage Chakradhanu took his birth from Surya. That divine sage<br>afterwards came to be known by the name of Kapila, and it was by him that<br>the (sixty thousand) sons of Sagara were afflicted. It was here that a<br>class of Brahmanas named Sivas, fully mastering the Vedas, became crowned<br>with (ascetic) success. Having studied all the Vedas they at last<br>attained eternal salvation. In this region is the city called Bhogavati<br>that is ruled by Vasuki, by the Naga Takshaka and also by Airavata. They<br>that have to journey hither (after death) encounter here a thick gloom.<br>And so thick is that gloom that it cannot be penetrated by either the Sun<br>himself or by Agni. Worthy of worship as thou art, even thou shalt have<br>to pass this road. Tell me now if thou wishest to sojourn towards this<br>direction. Else, I listen to an account of the western direction.'"
