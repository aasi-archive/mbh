                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Reflecting (for a moment), with eyes red in anger,<br>he, of Dasarha's race, addressing Duryodhana in that assembly of the<br>Kurus, then said these words, 'Wishest thou for a bed of heroes? Verily,<br>thou shalt have it, with thy consellors. Wait (for a short while), a<br>great slaughter will ensue. Thou thinkest, O thou of little<br>understanding, that thou hast committed no offence against the Pandavas?<br>Let the (assembled) monarchs judge. Grieved at the prosperity of the<br>high-souled Pandavas, thou conspirest, O Bharata, with Suvala's son about<br>the gambling match. O sire, how could those virtuous, honest, and<br>superior kinsmen of thine (otherwise) engage in such a wicked act with<br>the deceitful Sakuni? O thou that art endued with great wisdom, gambling<br>robs even the good of their understanding, and as regards the wicked,<br>disunion and dire consequence spring from it. It was thou who hadst<br>devised with thy wicked counsellors, that terrible source of calamity in<br>the form of the gambling match, without consulting with persons of<br>righteous behaviour. Who else is there, capable of insulting a brother's<br>wife in the way thou didst or of dragging her into the assembly and<br>addressing her in language thou hadst used towards Draupadi? Of noble<br>parentage, and endued with excellent behaviour, and dearer to them than<br>their very lives, the queen-consort of Pandu's sons was treated even thus<br>by thee. All the Kauravas know what words were addressed in their<br>assembly by Dussasana unto those chastisers of foes,&#8212;the sons of<br>Kunti,&#8212;when they were about to set out for the woods. Who is there<br>capable of behaving so wretchedly towards his own honest kinsmen, that<br>are ever engaged in the practice of virtue, that are untainted by<br>avarice, and that are always correct in their behaviour? Language such as<br>becomes only those that are heartless and despicable, was frequently<br>repeated by Karna and Dussasana and also by thee. Thou hadst taken great<br>pains to burn to death, at Varanavata, the sons of Pandu with their<br>mother, while they were children, although that effort of thine was not<br>crowned with success. After this, the Pandavas with their mother were<br>obliged to live for a long while, concealed in the town of Ekachakra in<br>the abode of a Brahmana. With poison, with snakes and cords, thou hadst,<br>by every means, sought the destruction of the Pandavas, although none of<br>thy designs was successful. With such feelings when thou hadst always<br>acted towards them so deceitfully, how canst thou say that thou hast not<br>offended against the high-souled Pandavas? Thou art not, O sinful man,<br>willing to give them their paternal share in the kingdom, although they<br>are begging it of thee. Thou shalt have to give it them, this, when<br>divested of prosperity, thou shalt be laid low. Having, like a heartless<br>fellow, done innumerable wrongs to the Pandavas and behaved so<br>deceitfully towards them, thou seekest now to appear in a different garb.<br>Though repeatedly solicited by thy parents, by Bhishma, Drona, and<br>Vidura, to make peace, thou dost not yet, O king, make peace. Great is<br>the advantage in peace, O king, both to thyself and Yudhishthira. Peace,<br>however, does not recommend itself to thee. To what else can it be due,<br>but to thy loss of understanding? Transgressing the words of thy friends,<br>thou canst never attain to what is for thy benefit. Sinful and<br>disreputable is that act, which thou, O king, art about to do.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'While he, of Dasarha's race, was saying this,<br>Dussasana addressed vindictive Duryodhana and said unto him these words<br>in the midst of the Kurus, If, O king, thou dost not willingly make peace<br>with the Pandavas, verity the Kauravas will bind thee (hand and foot) and<br>make over thee to the son of Kunti. Bhishma, and Drona, and thy (own)<br>father, O bull amongst men, will make over us three, viz., Vikartana's<br>son, thyself, and myself, to the Pandavas!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of his brother,<br>Dhritarashtra's son, wicked, shameless, disobedient, disrespectful, and<br>vain Suyodhana, breathing heavily like a great snake rose up from his<br>seat in anger, and disregarding Vidura, and Dhritarashtra and the great<br>king Vahlika, and Kripa, and Somadatta, and Bhishma, and Drona, and<br>Janardana, in fact, all of them, went out of the court, And beholding<br>that bull among men leave the court, his brother and all his counsellors,<br>and all the kings, followed him. And seeing Duryodhana rise and leave the<br>court in anger with his brothers, Santanu's son, Bhishma said, 'The<br>enemies of that person, who, abandoning both virtue and profit, followeth<br>the impulses of wrath, rejoice on beholding him plunged into distress at<br>no distant date. This wicked son of Dhritarashtra, this one unacquainted<br>with the true means (of accomplishing his objects), this fool that is<br>wrongly vain of his sovereignty, obeyeth only the dictates of wrath and<br>avarice. I see also, O Janardana, that the hour of all those Kshatriyas<br>is arrived, for all those kings, from delusion, have with their<br>counsellors followed Duryodhana.' Hearing these words of Bhishma, the<br>lotus-eyed hero of Dasarha's race, possessed of great powers, addressing<br>all those (that were still there) headed by Bhishma and Drona, said,<br>'Even this is great transgression, of which all the elders of the Kuru<br>race are becoming guilty, for they do not forcibly seize and bind this<br>wicked king in the enjoyment of sovereignty. Ye chastiser of foes, I<br>think the time hath come for doing this. If this is done, it may still be<br>productive of good. Listen to me, ye sinless ones. The words I will speak<br>will soon lead to beneficial results, if, indeed, ye Bharatas, ye accept<br>what I say in consequence of its recommending itself to you. The wicked<br>son, of ill-regulated soul, of the old Bhoja king, having usurped his<br>father's sovereignty during the latter's life-time, subjected himself to<br>death. Indeed, Kansa, the son of Ugrasena, abandoned by his relatives,<br>was slain by me in a great encounter, from desire of benefiting my<br>kinsmen. Ourselves with our kinsmen then, having paid due honours to<br>Ugrasena, the son of Ahuka, installed that extender of Bhoja's kingdom on<br>the throne. And all the Yadavas and Andhakas and the Vrishnis, abandoning<br>a single person, viz., Kansa for the sake of their whole race, have<br>prospered and obtained happiness. O king, when the gods and Asuras were<br>arrayed for battle and weapons were upraised for striking, the lord of<br>all creatures, Parameshthin said thus (something which applies to the<br>case at hand). Indeed, O Bharata, when the population of the worlds was<br>divided into two parties and was about to be slaughtered, the divine and<br>holy Cause of the universe, viz., the Creator, said, 'The Asuras and the<br>Daityas with the Danavas will be vanquished, and the Adityas, the Vasus,<br>the Rudras and other dwellers of heaven will be victorious. Indeed, the<br>gods, and Asuras, and human beings, and Gandharvas, and Snakes, and<br>Rakshasas, will in rage slaughter one another in this battle.' Thinking<br>so, the Lord of all creatures, Parameshthin, commanded Dharma, saying,<br>'Binding fast, the Daityas and the Danavas, make them over to Varuna.'<br>Thus addressed, Dharma, at the command of Parameshthin, binding the<br>Daityas and the Danavas, made them over to Varuna. And Varuna, the Lord<br>of the waters, having bound those Danavas, with Dharma's noose, as also<br>with his own, keepeth them within the depths of the ocean, always<br>guarding them carefully. Binding in the same way Duryodhana and Karna and<br>Sakuni, the son of Suvala, and Dussasana, make them over to the Pandavas.<br>For the sake of a family, an individual may be sacrificed. For a village,<br>a family may be sacrificed. For the sake of a province, a village may be<br>sacrificed. And lastly, for the sake of one's self, the whole earth may<br>be sacrificed. O monarch, binding Duryodhana fast, make peace with the<br>Pandavas. O bull among Kshatriyas, let not the whole Kshatriya race be<br>slaughtered on thy account.'"
