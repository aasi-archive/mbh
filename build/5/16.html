                            "Vrihaspati said, 'Thou art the mouth, O Agni, of all the gods. Thou art<br>the carrier of sacred offerings. Thou, like a witness, hast access to the<br>inner souls of all creatures. The poets call thee single, and again<br>three-fold. O eater of burnt offerings, abandoned by thee the Universe<br>would forthwith cease to be. The Brahmanas by bowing to thee, win with<br>their wives and sons an eternal region, the reward of their own<br>meritorious deeds. O Agni, it is thou who art the bearer of sacred<br>offerings. Thou, O Agni, art thyself the best offering. In a sacrificial<br>ceremony of the supreme order, it is thee that they worship with<br>incessant gifts and offerings. O bearer of offerings, having created the<br>three worlds, thou when the hour cometh, consumeth them in thy unkindled<br>form. Thou art the mother of the whole Universe; and thou again, O Agni,<br>art its termination. The wise call thee identical with the clouds and<br>with the lightning; flames issuing from thee, support all creatures. All<br>the waters are deposited in thee; so is this entire world. To thee, O<br>purifier, nothing is unknown in the three worlds. Every body taketh<br>kindly to his progenitor; do thou enter the waters without fear. I shall<br>render thee strong with the eternal hymns of the Veda. Thus glorified,<br>the bearer of burnt offerings, that best of poets, well-pleased, spoke<br>laudable words to Vrihaspati. And he said, 'I shall show Indra to thee.<br>This I tell thee for truth.'<br><br>"Salya continued, 'Then Agni entered the waters including seas and tiny<br>ponds, and came to that reservoir, where, O best of Bharata's race, while<br>searching the lotus flowers, he saw the king of the gods lying within the<br>fibres of a lotus-stalk. And soon coming back, he informed Vrihaspati how<br>Indra had taken refuge in the fibres of a lotus-stalk, assuming a minute<br>form. Then Vrihaspati, accompanied by the gods, the saints and the<br>Gandharvas, went and glorified the slayer of Vala by referring to his<br>former deeds. And he said, 'O Indra, the great Asura Namuchi was killed<br>by thee; and those two Asuras also of terrible strength, viz., Samvara<br>and Vala. Wax strong, O performer of a hundred sacrifices, and slay all<br>thy foes. Rise, O Indra! Behold, here are assembled the gods and the<br>saints. O Indra, O great lord, by slaying Asuras, thou hast delivered the<br>worlds. Having got the froth of waters, strengthened with Vishnu's<br>energy, thou formerly slew Vritra. Thou art the refuge of all creatures<br>and art adorable. There is no being equal to thee. All the creatures, O<br>Indra, are supported by thee, Thou didst build the greatness of the gods.<br>Deliver all, together with the worlds by assuming thy strength, O great<br>Indra.' And thus glorified, Indra increased little by little; and having<br>assumed his own form, he waxed strong and spoke to the preceptor<br>Vrihaspati standing before. And he said, 'What business of yours yet<br>remaineth; the great Asuras, son of Twashtri, hath been killed; and<br>Vritra also, whose form was exceedingly big and who destroyed the worlds.'<br><br>"Vrihaspati said, 'The human Nahusha, a king, having, obtained the throne<br>of heaven by virtue of the power of the divine saints, is giving us<br>exceeding trouble.'<br><br>"Indra said, 'How hath Nahusha obtained the throne of heaven, difficult<br>to get? What austerities did he practise? How great is his power, O<br>Vrihaspati!'<br><br>"Vrihaspati said, 'The gods having been frightened, wished for a king of<br>heaven, for thou hadst given up the high dignity of heaven's ruler. Then<br>the gods, the Pitris of the universe, the saints, and the principal<br>Gandharvas, all met together, O Indra, and went to Nahusha and said, 'Be<br>thou our king, and the defender of the Universe!' To them said Nahusha,<br>'I am not able; fill me with your power and with the virtue of your<br>austerities!' So told, the deities strengthened him, O king of the gods!<br>And thereupon Nahusha became a person of terrible strength, and becoming<br>thus the ruler of the three worlds, he hath put the great saints in<br>harness, and the wretch is thus journeying from world to world. Mayst<br>thou never see Nahusha who is terrible. He emitteth poison from his eyes,<br>and absorbeth the energy of all. All the gods are exceedingly frightened;<br>they go about concealed and do not cast a glance at him!'<br><br>"Salya continued, While that best of Angira's race was thus speaking,<br>there came that guardian of the world, Kuvera, and also Yama the son of<br>Surya, and the old god Soma, and Varuna. And arrived there they said to<br>the great Indra, 'How lucky that the son of Twashtri hath been killed,<br>and Vritra also! How lucky, O Indra, that we are beholding thee safe and<br>sound, while all thy enemies have been killed!' Indra received all those<br>guardians of the worlds, and with a glad heart greeted them in proper<br>form with a view to requesting them in connection with Nahusha. And he<br>said, 'Nahusha of terrible mien is the king of the gods; therein lend me<br>your assistance.' They replied, 'Nahusha is of awful mien; his sight is<br>poison; we are afraid of him, O God. If thou overthrowest Nahusha, then<br>we shall be entitled to our shares of sacrificial offerings, O Indra.'<br>Indra said, 'Let it be so. You and the ruler of the waters, and Yama, and<br>Kuvera shall this day be crowned along with me. Aided by all the gods,<br>let us overthrow the foe Nahusha of terrible gaze.' Then Agni also said<br>to Indra, 'Give me a share in sacrificial offerings. I also shall lend<br>you my assistance.' Indra said to him, 'O Agni, thou also shalt get a<br>share in great sacrifices,&#8212;there will be a single share (in such) for<br>both Indra and Agni.'<br><br>"Salya continued, 'Thus did the illustrious lord Indra, the chastiser of<br>Paka, the giver of boons, bestow, after deliberation upon Kuvera the<br>sovereignty over the Yakshas, and all the wealth of the world; upon Yama,<br>the sovereignty over the Pitris; and upon Varuna, that over the waters.'
