                            "Dhritarashtra said, "I ask thee, O Sanjaya, in the presence of my boy<br>and of these kings, what words were said by the illustrious Dhananjaya of<br>might that knoweth no diminution,&#8212;that leader of warriors,&#8212;that<br>destroyer of the lives of the wicked?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Let Duryodhana listen to the words which the high-souled<br>Arjuna, eager for fight, uttered, with Yudhishthira's sanction and in the<br>hearing of Kesava. Fearless (in battle) and conscious of the might of his<br>arms, the heroic Kiritin, eager for fight, spoke thus unto me in the<br>presence of Vasudeva, 'Do thou, O suta, say unto Dhritarashtra's son, in<br>the presence of all the Kurus, and also in the hearing of that Suta's<br>son, of foul tongue and wicked soul, of little sense, stupid reason, and<br>of numbered days, who always desires to fight against me, and also in the<br>hearing of those kings assembled for fighting against the Pandavas, and<br>do thou see that all the words now uttered by me are heard well by that<br>king with his counsellors.' O monarch, even as the celestials eagerly<br>listen to the words of their chief armed with the thunderbolt, so did the<br>Pandavas and the Srinjayas listened to those words of grave import<br>uttered by Kiritin. Just these are the words spoken by Arjuna, the<br>wielder of Gandiva, eager for the fight and with eyes red as the lotus,<br>'If Dhritarashtra's son doth not surrender to king Yudhishthira of the<br>Ajamida race, his kingdom, then (it is evident) there must be some sinful<br>act committed by the sons of Dhritarashtra, whose consequences are yet<br>unreaped by them, for it can be nothing else when they desire battle with<br>Bhimasena and Arjuna, and the Aswins and Vasudeva and Sini's son, and<br>Dhrishtadyumna infallible in arms, and Sikhandin, and Yudhishthira, who<br>is like Indra himself and who can consume heaven and earth by merely<br>wishing them ill. If Dhritarashtra's son desireth war with these, then<br>will all objects of the Pandavas be accomplished. Do not, therefore,<br>propose peace for the sons of Pandu, but have war if thou likest. That<br>bed of woe in the woods which was Yudhishthira's when that virtuous son<br>of Pandu lived in exile; Oh, let a more painful bed than that, on the<br>bare earth, be now Duryodhana's and let him lie down on it, as his last,<br>deprived of life. Win thou over those men that were ruled by the wicked<br>Duryodhana of unjust conduct to the side of Pandu's son endued with<br>modesty and wisdom and asceticism and self-restraint and valour and might<br>regulated by virtue. Endued with humility and righteousness, with<br>asceticism and self-restraint and with valour regulated by virtue, and<br>always speaking the truth, our king, though afflicted by numerous<br>deceptions, hath forgiven all and hath patiently borne great wrongs. When<br>the eldest son of Pandu, of soul under proper control, will indignantly<br>dart at the Kurus his terrible wrath accumulated for years, then will the<br>son of Dhritarashtra repent for this war. As a blazing fire burning all<br>around consumeth dry grass in the hot season, so will Yudhishthira,<br>inflamed with wrath, consume the Dhritarashtra host by glance alone of<br>his eye. When Dhritarashtra's son will behold Bhimasena, that wrathful<br>Pandava of terrific impetus, stationed on his car, mace in hand, vomiting<br>the venom of his wrath, then will Duryodhana repent for this war. Indeed,<br>when he will behold Bhimasena, who always fighteth in the van, accoutred<br>in mail, scarcely capable of being looked at even by his own followers<br>felling hostile heroes and devastating the enemy's ranks like Yama<br>himself, then will the exceedingly vain Duryodhana recollect these words.<br>When he will behold elephants, looking like mountain-peaks, felled by<br>Bhimasena, blood flowing their broken heads like water from broken casks,<br>then will Dhritarashtra's son repent for this war. When falling upon the<br>sons of Dhritarashtra the fierce Bhima of terrible mien, mace in hand,<br>will slaughter them, like a huge lion falling upon a herd of kine, then<br>will Duryodhana repent for this war. When the heroic Bhima undaunted even<br>in situations of great danger and skilled in weapons-when that grinder of<br>hostile hosts in battle,&#8212;mounted on his car, and alone will crush by his<br>mace crowds of superior cars and entire ranks of infantry, seize by his<br>nooses strong as iron, the elephants of the hostile army, and mow down<br>the Dhritarashtra's host, like a sturdy woodsman cutting a forest down<br>with an axe, then will Dhritarashtra's son repent for this war. When he<br>will behold the Dhartarashtra's host consumed like a hamlet full of<br>straw-built huts by fire, or a field of ripe corn by lightning,&#8212;indeed<br>when he will behold his vast army scattered, its leaders slain, and men<br>running away with their back towards the field afflicted with fear, and<br>all the warriors, humbled to the dust, being scorched by Bhimasena with<br>the fire of his weapons,&#8212;then will the son of Dhritarashtra repent for<br>this war, When Nakula, that warrior of wonderful feats, that foremost of<br>all car-warriors, dexterously shooting arrows by hundreds, will mangle<br>the car-warriors of Duryodhana, then will the son of Dhritarashtra repent<br>for this war. Accustomed to enjoy all the comforts and luxuries of life,<br>when Nakula, recollecting that bed of woe on which he had slept for a<br>long time in the woods, will vomit the poison of his wrath like an angry<br>snake, then will the son of Dhritarashtra repent for this war. Ready to<br>lay down their very lives, the (allied) monarchs, O Suta, urged to battle<br>by king Yudhishthira the just, will furiously advance on their<br>resplendent cars against the (hostile) army. Beholding this, the son of<br>Dhritarashtra will certainly have to repent. When the Kuru prince will<br>behold the five heroic sons of (Draupadi), tender in years but not in<br>acts, and all well-versed in arms, rush, reckless of their lives, against<br>the Kauravas, then will that son of Dhritarashtra repent for this war.<br>When bent upon carnage Sahadeva, mounted on his car of noiseless wheels,<br>and motion incapable of being obstructed, and set with golden stars, and<br>drawn by well-trained steeds, will make the heads of monarchs roll on the<br>field of battle with volleys of arrows,&#8212;indeed, beholding that warrior<br>skilled in weapons, seated on his car in the midst of that frightful<br>havoc, turning now to the left and now to the right and falling upon the<br>foe in all directions, then will the son of Dhritarashtra repent for this<br>war. Indeed, when the modest but mighty Sahadeva, skilled in battle,<br>truthful, conversant with all the ways of morality, and endued with great<br>activity and impetuousness, will fall upon the son of Gandhari in fierce<br>encounter and rout all his followers, then will the son of Dhritarashtra<br>repent for this war. When he will behold the sons of Draupadi, those<br>great bowmen, those heroes skilled in weapons and well-versed in all the<br>ways of chariot-fighting, dart at the foe like snakes of virulent poison,<br>then will the son of Dhritarashtra repent for this war. When that slayer<br>of hostile heroes, Abhimanyu, skilled in arms like Krishna himself, will<br>overpower the foe showering upon them, like the very clouds, a thick<br>downpour of arrows, then will the son of Dhritarashtra repent for this<br>war. Indeed, when he will behold that son of Subhadra, a child in years<br>but not in energy, skilled in weapons and like unto Indra himself,<br>failing like Death's self upon the ranks of the foe, then will the son of<br>Dhritarashtra repent for this war. When the youthful Prabhadrakas, endued<br>with great activity, well-versed in battle, and possessed of the energy<br>of lions will overthrow the sons of Dhritarashtra with all their troops,<br>then will Duryodhana repent for this war. When those veteran car-warriors<br>Virata and Drupada will assail, at the head of their respective<br>divisions, the sons of Dhritarashtra and their ranks, then will<br>Duryodhana repent for this war. When Drupada, skilled in weapons, and<br>seated on his car, desirous of plucking the heads of youthful warriors,<br>will wrathfully strike them off with arrows shot from his bow, then will<br>the son of Dhritarashtra repent for this war. When that slayer of hostile<br>heroes, Virata will penetrate into the ranks of the foe, grinding all<br>before him with the aid of his Matsya warriors of cool courage, then will<br>the son of Dhritarashtra repent for this war. When he will behold in the<br>very van the eldest son of the Matsya king, of cool courage and collected<br>mien, seated on his car and accoutred in mail on behalf of the Pandavas,<br>then will the son of Dhritarashtra. repent for this war. I tell thee<br>truly that when that foremost of Kaurava heroes, the virtuous son of<br>Santanu, will be slain in battle by Sikhandin, then all our foes, without<br>doubt, will perish. Indeed, when, overthrowing numerous car-warriors,<br>Sikhandin, seated on his own well-protected car, will proceed towards<br>Bhishma, crushing multitudes of (hostile) cars by means of his own<br>powerful steeds, then will the son of Dhritarashtra repent for this war.<br>When he will behold Dhristadyumna unto whom Drona hath imparted all the<br>mysteries of the science of weapons, stationed in splendour in the very<br>van of the Srinjaya ranks, then will the son of Dhritarashtra repent.<br>Indeed, when the leader of the Pandava host, of immeasurable prowess and<br>capable of withstanding the rush of any force, will proceed to attack<br>Drona in battle, crushing with his arrows the Dhritarashtra ranks, then<br>will Duryodhana repent for this war. What enemy can withstand him who<br>hath, for fighting in his van, that lion of the Vrishni race, that chief<br>of the Somakas, who is modest and intelligent, mighty and endued with<br>great energy, and blessed with every kind of prosperity? Say also this<br>(unto Duryodhana),&#8212;Do not covet (the kingdom). We have chosen, for our<br>leader, the dauntless and mighty car-warrior Satyaki, the grandson of<br>Sini, skilled in weapons and having none on earth as his equal. Of broad<br>chest and long arms, that grinder of foes, unrivalled in battle, and<br>acquainted with the best of weapons, the grandson of Sini, skilled in<br>arms and perfectly dauntless, is a mighty car-warrior wielding a bow of<br>full four cubits' length. When that slayer of foes, that chief of the<br>Sinis, urged by me, will shower, like the very clouds, his arrows on the<br>foe, completely overwhelming their leaders with that downpour, then will<br>the son of Dhritarashtra repent for this war. When that illustrious<br>warrior of long arms and firm grasp of the bow, musters his resolution<br>for fight, the foe then, like kine getting the scent of the lion, fly<br>away from him before even commencing the encounter. That illustrious<br>warrior of long arms and firm grasp of the bow is capable of splitting<br>the very hills and destroying the entire universe. Practised in weapons,<br>skilled (in battle), and endued with exceeding lightness of hand, he<br>shineth on the field of battle like the sun himself in the sky. That lion<br>of the Vrishni race, that scion of Yadu's line, of superior training,<br>hath diverse wonderful and excellent weapons. Indeed, Satyaki is<br>possessed of a knowledge of all those uses of weapons that are said to be<br>of the highest excellence. When he will behold in battle the golden car<br>of Satyaki of Madhu's race, drawn by four white steeds, then will that<br>wretch of uncontrolled passions, the son of Dhritarashtra, repent. When<br>he will also behold my terrible car, endued with the effulgence of gold<br>and bright gems, drawn by white steeds and furnished with the banner<br>bearing the device of the Ape and guided by Kesava himself, then will<br>that wretch of uncontrolled passions repent. When he will hear the fierce<br>twang produced by the constant stretch of the bow-string with fingers<br>cased in leather gloves,&#8212;that terrible twang, loud as the rolling of the<br>thunder, of my bow Gandiva wielded by me in the midst of the great<br>battle,&#8212;then will that wicked wretch, the son of Dhritarashtra repent,<br>beholding himself abandoned by his troops, flying away like kine from the<br>field of battle in all directions, overwhelmed with the darkness created<br>by my arrowy downpour. When he will behold innumerable keen-edged arrows,<br>furnished with beautiful wings, and capable of penetrating into the very<br>vitals, shot from the string of Gandiva, like fierce and terrible flashes<br>of lightning emitted by the clouds, destroying enemies by thousands, and<br>devouring numberless steeds and elephants clad in mail, then will the son<br>of Dhritarashtra repent for this war. When he will behold the arrows shot<br>by the enemy turned off, or turned back struck by my shafts, or cut to<br>pieces pierced transversely by my arrows, then will the foolish son of<br>Dhritarashtra repent for this war. When broad-headed arrows shot by my<br>hands will strike off the heads of youthful warriors, like birds picking<br>off fruits from the tree-tops, then will the son of Dhritarashtra repent<br>for this war. When he will behold excellent warriors of his failing down<br>from their cars, and elephants and steeds rolling on the field, deprived<br>of life by my arrows, then will the son of Dhritarashtra repent for this<br>war. When he will behold his brothers, even before fairly coming within<br>the range of the enemy's weapons, die all around, without having achieved<br>anything in battle, then will the son of Dhritarashtra repent for this<br>war. When pouring my blazing shafts incessantly, I will, like Death<br>himself with mouth wide-open, destroy on all sides multitudes of cars and<br>foot-soldiers, then will that wretch repent. When he will behold his own<br>troops, covered with the dust raised by my car wander in all directions,<br>torn to pieces by Gandiva and reft of senses, then will that wretch<br>repent. When he will behold his whole army running away in fear in all<br>directions, mangled in limbs, and bereft of senses; when he will behold<br>his steeds, elephants, and foremost of heroes slain; when he will see his<br>troops thirsty, struck with panic, wailing aloud, dead and dying, with<br>their animals exhausted; and hair, bones and skulls lying in heaps around<br>like half-wrought works of the Creator, then will that wretch repent.<br>When he will behold on my car, Gandiva, Vasudeva, and the celestial conch<br>Panchajanya, myself, my couple of inexhaustible quivers, and my conch<br>called Devadatta as also my white steeds, then will the son of<br>Dhritarashtra repent for this war. When I consume the Kauravas, like Agni<br>consuming innumerable wicked souls assembled together at the time of<br>ushering in another Yuga at the end of the last one, then Dhritarashtra<br>with all his sons repent. When the wicked, hearted and the wrathful son<br>of Dhritarashtra will be deprived of prosperity with brothers and army<br>and followers, then, reft of pride and losing heart and trembling all<br>over, will that fool repent. One morning when I had finished my<br>water-rites and prayers, a Brahmana spoke unto me these pleasant words,<br>'O Partha, thou shalt have to execute a very difficult task. O<br>Savyasachin, thou shalt have to fight with thy foes. Either Indra riding<br>on his excellent steed and thunderbolt in hand will walk before thee<br>slaying thy foes in battle, or Krishna, the son of Vasudeva will protect<br>thee from behind riding on his car drawn by the steeds headed by Sugriva.<br>Relying on those words, I have, in this battle passing over Indra, the<br>wielder of the thunderbolt, preferred Vasudeva as my ally. That Krishna<br>hath been obtained by me for the destruction of those wicked ones. I see<br>the hand of the gods in all this. The person whose success is only wished<br>for by Krishna, without the latter's actually taking up arms in his<br>behalf, is certain to prevail over all enemies, even if those be the<br>celestials with Indra at their head, while anxiety there is none if they<br>be human. He that wisheth to conquer in battle that foremost of heroes,<br>Vasudeva's son Krishna endued with great energy, wisheth to cross by his<br>two arms alone the great ocean of wide expanse and immeasurable water.<br>He. that wisheth to split by a slap of his palm the high Kailasa<br>mountain, is not able to do the slightest damage to the mountain although<br>his hand only with its nails is sure to wear away. He that would conquer<br>Vasudeva in battle, would, with his two arms, extinguish a blazing fire,<br>stop the Sun and the Moon, and plunder by force the Amrita of the<br>gods,&#8212;that Vasudeva, viz., who having mowed down in battle by main force<br>all the royal warriors of the Bhoja race, had carried off on a single car<br>Rukmini of great fame for making her his wife; and by her was afterwards<br>born Pradyumna of high soul. It was this favourite of the gods, who,<br>having speedily smashed the Gandharas and conquered all the sons of<br>Nagnajit, forcibly liberated from confinement king Sudarsana of great<br>energy. It was he that slew king Pandya by striking his breast against<br>his, and moved down the Kalingas in battle Burnt by him, the city of<br>Varanasi remained for many years without e king, incapable of being<br>defeated by others. Ekalavya, the king of the Nishadas, always used to<br>challenge this one to battle; but slain by Krishna he lay dead like the<br>Asura Jambha violently thrashed on a hillock. It was Krishna, who, having<br>Baladeva for his second, slew Ugrasena's wicked son (Kansa), seated in<br>court in the midst of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas, and then gave unto<br>Ugrasena the kingdom. It was Krishna who fought with king Salya, the lord<br>of Saubha, stationed in the skies, fearless in consequence of his powers<br>of illusion; and it was he, who, at the gate of Subha caught with his<br>hands the fierce Sataghni (hurled by Saubha's lord). What mortal is able<br>to bear his might? The Asuras had a city named Pragjyotisha, which was<br>formidable, inaccessible and unbearable. It was there that the mighty<br>Naraka, the son of the Earth, kept the jewelled ear-rings of Aditi,<br>having brought them by force. The very gods, who, fearless of death,<br>assembled together with Sakra at their head were incapable of conquering<br>him. Beholding Kesava's prowess and might, and weapon that is<br>irresistible, and knowing also the object of his birth, the gods employed<br>him for the destruction of those Asuras. Vasudeva, too, endued with all<br>the divine attributes that ensure success, agreed to undertake that<br>exceedingly difficult task. In the city of Nirmochana that hero slew six<br>thousand Asuras, and cutting into pieces innumerable keen-edged shafts,<br>he slew Mura and hosts of Rakshasas, and then entered that city. It was<br>there, that an encounter took place between the mighty' Naraka and Vishnu<br>of immeasurable strength. Slain by Krishna, Naraka lay lifeless there,<br>like a Karnikara tree uprooted by the wind. Having slain the Earth's son,<br>Naraka, and also Mura, and having recovered those jewelled ear-rings, the<br>learned Krishna of unparalleled prowess came back, adorned with beauty<br>and undying fame. Having witnessed his terrible feats in that battle, the<br>gods then and there blessed him saying, 'Fatigue will never be thine in<br>fights, neither the firmament nor the waters shall stop thy course, nor<br>shall weapons penetrate thy body.' And Krishna, by all this, regarded<br>himself amply rewarded. Immeasurable, and possessed of great might, in<br>Vasudeva ever exist all the virtues. And yet the son of Dhritarashtra<br>seeketh to vanquish that unbearable Vishnu of infinite energy, for that<br>wretch often thinks of imprisoning him. Krishna, however, beareth all<br>this for our sake only. That wretch seeketh to create a sudden disunion<br>between Krishna and myself. How far, however, he is capable of taking<br>away the affection of Krishna from the Pandavas, he will see on the field<br>of battle. Having bowed down unto Santanu's son, and also Drona with his<br>son, and the unrivalled son of Saradwat, I shall fight for regaining our<br>kingdom. The God of justice himself, I am sure, will bring destruction on<br>that sinful man who will fight with the Pandavas. Deceitfully defeated at<br>dice by those wretches, ourselves, of royal birth, had to pass twelve<br>years in great distress in the forest and one long year in a state of<br>concealment. When those Pandavas are still alive, how shall the sons of<br>Dhritarashtra rejoice, possessing rank and affluence? If they vanquish us<br>in fight, aided by the very gods headed by Indra, the then practice of<br>vice would be better than virtue, and surely there would be nothing like<br>righteousness on earth. If man is affected by his acts, if we be superior<br>to Duryodhana, then, I hope that, with Vasudeva as my second, I shall<br>slay Duryodhana, with all his kinsmen. O lord of men, if the act of<br>robbing us of our kingdom be wicked, if these our own good deeds be not<br>fruitless, than beholding both this and that, it seems to me, the<br>overthrow of Duryodhana is certain. Ye Kauravas, ye will see it with your<br>eyes that, if they fight, the sons of Dhritarashtra shall certainly<br>perish. If they act otherwise instead of fighting, then they may live;<br>but in the event of a battle ensuing, none of them will be left alive.<br>Slaying all the sons of Dhritarashtra along with Karna, I shall surely<br>wrest the hole of their kingdom, Do ye, meanwhile, whatever ye think<br>best, and enjoy also your wives and other sweet things of life. There<br>are, with us, many aged Brahmanas, versed in various sciences, of amiable<br>behaviour, well-born, acquainted with the cycle of the years, engaged in<br>the study of astrology, capable of understanding with certainty the<br>motions of planets and the conjunctions of stars as also of explaining<br>the mysteries of fate, and answering questions relating to the future,<br>acquainted with the signs of the Zodiac, and versed with the occurrences<br>of every hour, who are prophesying the great destruction of the Kurus and<br>the Srinjayas, and the ultimate victory of the Pandavas, so that<br>Yudhishthira, who never made an enemy, already regardeth his objects<br>fulfilled in consequence of the slaughter of his foes. And Janardana<br>also, that lion among the Vrishnis, endued with the knowledge of the<br>invisible future, without doubt, beholdeth all this. And I also, with<br>unerring foresight, myself behold that future, for that foresight of<br>mine, acquired of old, is not obstructed. The sons of Dhritarashtra, if<br>they fight, will not live. My bow, Gandiva, yawneth without being<br>handled; my bow-string trembleth without being stretched; and arrows<br>also, issuing from my quiver's mouth, are again and again seeking to fly.<br>My bright scimitar issueth of itself from its sheath, like a snake<br>quitting its own worn off slough; and on the top of my flag-staff are<br>heard terrific voices,&#8212;When shall thy car be yoked, O Kiritin?<br>Innumerable jackals set up hideous howls at night, and Rakshasas<br>frequently alight from the sky; deer and jackals and peacocks, crows and<br>vultures and cranes, and wolves and birds of golden plumage, follow in<br>the rear of my car when my white steeds are yoked unto it. Single-handed<br>I can despatch, with arrowy showers, all warlike kings, to the regions of<br>death. As a blazing fire consumeth a forest in the hot season, so,<br>exhibiting diverse courses, I will hurl those great weapons called<br>Sthur-karna, Pasupata, and Brahma, and all those that Sakra gave me, all<br>of which are endued with fierce impetuosity. And with their aid, setting<br>my heart on the destruction of those monarchs, I will leave no remnant of<br>those that come to the field of battle. I will rest, having done all<br>this. Even this is my chief and decided resolve. Tell them this, O son of<br>Gavalgana. Look at the folly of Duryodhana! O Suta, they that are<br>invincible in battle even if encountered with the aid of the very gods<br>headed by Indra,&#8212;even against them that son of Dhritarashtra thinketh of<br>warring! But so let it be even as the aged Bhishma, the son of Santanu,<br>and Kripa, and Drona with his son, and Vidura endued with great wisdom,<br>are saying, 'May the Kauravas all live long!"
