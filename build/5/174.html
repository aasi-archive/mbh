                            "Duryodhana said, 'For what reason, O chief of the Bharatas, wilt thou<br>not slay Sikhandin even if thou beholdest him approach thee as a foe with<br>arms upraised? Thou hadst, O mighty-armed one, formerly told me,&#8212;I will<br>slay the Panchalas with the Somakas'&#8212;O son of Ganga, tell me, O<br>grandsire (the reason of the present reservation),'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen, O Duryodhana, to this history, with all these<br>lords of earth, as to why I will not slay Sikhandin even if I behold him<br>in battle! My father, Santanu, O king, was celebrated over all the world.<br>O bull of the Bharata race, that king of virtuous soul paid his debt to<br>nature in time, Observing my pledge, O chief of the Bharatas, I then<br>installed my brother, Chitrangada, on the throne of the extensive kingdom<br>of the Kurus. After Chitrangada's demise, obedient to the counsels of<br>Satyavati, I installed, according to the ordinance, Vichitravirya as<br>king. Although young in age, yet being installed duly by me, O monarch,<br>the virtuous Vichitravirya looked up to me in everything. Desirous of<br>marrying him, I set my heart upon procuring daughters from a suitable<br>family. (At that time) I heard, O thou of mighty arms, that three<br>maidens, all unrivalled for beauty, daughters of the ruler of Kasi, by<br>name Amva, Amvika, and Amvalika would select husbands for themselves, and<br>that all the kings of the earth, O bull of the Bharata's race, had been<br>invited. Amongst those maidens Amva was the eldest, Amvika the second,<br>while the princess Amvalika, O monarch, was the youngest. Myself<br>repairing on a single car to the city of the ruler of Kasi, I beheld, O<br>thou of mighty arms, the three maidens adorned with ornaments and also<br>all the kings of the earth invited thither on the occasion. Then, O bull<br>of Bharata's race, challenging to battle all those kings who were ready<br>for the encounter, I took up those maidens on my car and repeatedly said<br>unto all the kings assembled there these words&#8212;Bhishma, the son of<br>Santanu, is carrying away by force these maidens. Ye kings, strive ye all<br>to the best of your power for rescuing them! By force do I take them<br>away, ye bulls among men, making you spectators of my act!&#8212;At these<br>words of mine those rulers of the earth sprang up with weapons<br>unsheathed. And they angrily urged the drivers of their cars, saying,<br>'Make ready the cars,&#8212;Make ready the cars.' And those monarchs sprang up<br>to the rescue, with weapons unsheathed; car-warriors on their cars<br>resembling masses of clouds, those fighting from elephants, on their<br>elephants, and others on their stout and plump steeds. Then all those<br>kings, O monarch, surrounded me on all sides with a multitudinous number<br>of cars. With a shower of arrows, I stopped their onrush on all sides and<br>vanquished them like the chief of celestials vanquishing hordes of<br>Danavas. Laughingly, with easiness I cut down the variegated standards,<br>decked with gold, of the advancing kings, with blazing shafts, O bull of<br>Bharata's race! In that combat I overthrew their steeds and elephants and<br>car-drivers, each with a single arrow. Beholding that lightness (of hand)<br>of mine, they desisted (from the fight) and broke. And having vanquished<br>all those rulers of the earth, I came back to Hastinapura, I then, O thou<br>of mighty arms, made over those maidens, intending them for my brothers<br>to Satyavati and represented unto her everything I had done.'"
