                            "Sanjaya said, 'Having reached the Pandava camp, the gambler's son<br>(Uluka) presented himself before the Pandavas, and addressing<br>Yudhishthira said, 'Thou art fully conversant with what envoys say! It<br>behoveth thee not, therefore, to be angry with me if I repeat those words<br>only which Duryodhana hath instructed me to tell!'<br><br>"Hearing this, Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast no fear., O Uluka! Tell us,<br>without any anxiety what are the views of the covetous Duryodhana of<br>limited sight!' Then in the midst and presence of the illustrious and<br>high-souled Pandavas, of the Srinjayas, and Krishna possessed of great<br>fame, of Drupada with his sons, of Virata, and of all monarchs, Uluka<br>said these words.'<br><br>"Uluka said, 'Even this is what the high-souled king Duryodhana hath in<br>the presence of all the Kuru heroes, said unto thee! Listen to those<br>words, O Yudhishthira! Thou wert defeated at dice, and Krishna was<br>brought into the assembly! At this, a person who regardeth himself a man<br>would be justified in giving way to wrath! For twelve years wert thou<br>banished from home into the woods! For one whole year didst thou live in<br>Virata's service. Remembering the reason there is for wrath, thy exile,<br>and the persecution of Krishna, be a man, O son of Pandu! Though weak,<br>Bhima yet, O Pandava, made a vow! Let him, if able, drink the blood of<br>Dussasana! Thy weapons have been properly worshipped and their presiding<br>deities have been invoked! The field of Kurukshetra also is without mire.<br>The roads are even. Thy steeds are well-fed. Engage in battle, therefore,<br>on the morrow, with Kesava as thy ally! Without having yet approached<br>Bhishma in battle, why dost thou indulge in boasts? Like a fool that<br>boasteth of his intention to ascend the mountains of Gandhamadana, thou,<br>O son of Kunti, art indulging in a vain boast. Without having vanquished<br>in battle the Suta's son (Karna) who is invincible, and Salya, that<br>foremost of mighty persons, and that first of all warriors and equal unto<br>Sachi's lord himself in combat, why, O son of Pritha, dost thou wish for<br>sovereignty? A preceptor in both the Vedas and the bow, he hath reached<br>the end of both these branches of learning. Thou desirest in vain, O son<br>of Pritha, to vanquish that leader of troops, the illustrious Drona, who<br>fightest in the van, is incapable of being agitated, and whose strength<br>knows no diminution. Never have we heard that the mountains of Sumeru<br>have been crushed by the wind! But the wind will bear away Sumeru, heaven<br>itself will fall down on the earth, the very Yugas will be reversed if<br>what thou hast said unto me really taketh place! Who is there fond of<br>life, fighting from the back of an elephant or of a horse or from a car,<br>that would return home (safe and sound), after having encountered that<br>grinder of foes? What creature treading the earth with his feet, would<br>escape with life from battle, having been attacked by Drona and Bhishma,<br>or pierced with their terrible shafts? Like a frog within a well, why<br>dost thou not realise the strength of this assembled host of monarchs,<br>which resembleth the very celestial host, and which is protected by these<br>kings like the gods protecting theirs in heaven, and which, swarming with<br>the kings of the East, West, South, and North, with Kamvojas, Sakas,<br>Khasas, Salwas, Matsyas, Kurus of the middle country, Mlechchhas,<br>Pulindas, Dravidas, Andhras, and Kanchis, indeed, with many nations, all<br>addressed for battle, is uncrossable like the swollen tide of Ganga? O<br>fool of little understanding, how wilt thou fight with me while I am<br>stationed in the midst of my elephant force?'<br><br>'Having said these words unto king Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma,<br>Uluka, turning his face then towards Jishnu, said unto him these words,<br>'Fight without bragging, O Arjuna! Why dost thou brag so much? Success<br>resulteth from the application of method. A battle is never won by<br>bragging. If acts in this world, O Dhananjaya, succeeded in consequence<br>only of boasts, then all men would have succeeded in their objects, for<br>who is there that is not competent to brag? I know that thou hast<br>Vasudeva for thy ally. I know that thy Gandiva is full six cubits long. I<br>know that there is no warrior equal to thee. Knowing all this, I retain<br>thy kingdom yet! A man never winneth success in consequence of the<br>attribute of lineage. It is the Supreme Ordainer alone who by his fiat<br>maketh (things hostile) friendly and subservient. For these thirteen<br>years have I enjoyed sovereignty, while ye were weeping! I shall continue<br>to rule in the same way, slaying thee with thy kinsmen! Where was thy<br>Gandiva then when thou wert made a slave won at dice? Where, O Falguni,<br>was Bhimasena's might then? Your deliverance then came neither from<br>Bhimasena armed with mace, nor from you armed with Gandiva, but from<br>faultless Krishna. It was she, the daughter of Prishata's house, that<br>delivered you all, sunk in slavery, engaged in occupations worthy only of<br>the low, and working as servitors! I characterised ye as sesame seeds<br>without kernel. That is very true, for, did not Partha bear a braid while<br>living in Virata's city? In the cooking apartments of Virata, Bhimasena<br>was fatigued with doing the work of a cook. Even this, O son of Kunti, is<br>(evidence of) thy manliness! Flying from an encounter with braids and<br>waist-bands thyself binding thy hair into a braid, thou wert employed in<br>teaching the girls to dance! It is thus that Kshatriyas always inflict<br>punishment on a Kshatriya! From fear of Vasudeva, or from fear of<br>thyself, O Falguni, I will not give up the kingdom. Fight, with Kesava as<br>thy ally! Neither deception, nor conjuror's tricks, nor jugglery can<br>terrify an armed man ready for fight. On the other hand, all this<br>provokes only his wrath! A thousand Vasudevas, a hundred Falgunis,<br>approaching me whose aim and weapons never go for nothing, will fly away<br>in all directions, Encounter Bhishma in combat, or pierce the hills with<br>thy head, or cross with the aid of thy two arms the vast and deep main!<br>As regards my army, it is a veritable ocean with Saradwat's son as its<br>large fish; Vivingsati, its smaller fish; Vrihadvala its waves;<br>Somadatta's son its whale; Bhishma its mighty force; Drona its<br>unconquerable alligator; Karna and Salya, its fishes and whirlpools;<br>Kamvoja its equine head vomiting fire, Jayadratha its (submarine) rock,<br>Purumitra its depth, Durmarshana its waters, and Sakuni its shores! When<br>having plunged into this swelling ocean with its inexhaustible waves of<br>weapons thou wilt from fatigue be deprived of thy senses, and have all<br>thy relatives and friends slain, then will repentance possess thy heart!<br>Then will thy heart turn away, O Partha, from the thought of ruling the<br>earth like the heart of a person of impure deeds turning away from (hope<br>of) heaven. Indeed, for thee to win a kingdom to rule is as impossible as<br>for one not possessed of ascetic merit to obtain heaven!'"
