                            "Galava said, 'O Garuda, O slayer of foremost snakes, O thou of beautiful<br>feathers, O son of Vinata, carry me, O Tarkhya, to the east where the two<br>eyes of Dharma are first opened. O, take me to the east which thou hast<br>first described, and whither, thou hast said, the gods are always<br>present. Thou hast said that thither both truth and virtue reside. I<br>desire to meet all the gods. Therefore, O younger brother of Aruna, take<br>me thither, so that I may behold the gods.'<br><br>"Narada continued, 'Thus addressed, the son of Vinata replied unto that<br>Brahmana saying, 'Mount thou on my back.' And thereupon, the Muni Galava<br>rode on the back of Garuda. And Galava said, 'Thy beauty, O devourer of<br>snakes, as thou proceedest, seemeth to be like that of the sun himself in<br>the morning, that maker of the day endued with a thousand rays. And, O<br>ranger of the skies, thy speed is so great that the very trees, broken by<br>the storm caused by the flapping of thy wings, seem to pursue thee in the<br>course. Thou seemest, O tenant of the welkin, to drag by the storm caused<br>by the wings, the very Earth with all the waters of her oceans, and with<br>all her mountains, woods and forests. Indeed, the tempest caused by the<br>motion of thy wings seems to continually raise into mid air the waters of<br>the sea, with all their fishes and snakes and crocodiles. I see fishes<br>possessed of similar faces, and Timis and Timingilas and snakes endued<br>with human faces, all crushed by the tempest raised by thy wings. My ears<br>are deafened by the roar of the deep. So stunned am I that I can neither<br>hear nor see anything. Indeed, I have forgotten my own purpose. Slacken<br>thy speed, O ranger of the sky, remembering the risk to a Brahmana's<br>life. O sire, neither the sun, nor the cardinal points, nor the welkin<br>itself, is any longer perceptible to me. I see only a thick gloom around<br>me. The body is no longer visible to me. I see only thy two eyes, O<br>oviparous being, resembling two radiant gems. I cannot see either thy<br>body or my own. At every step, I behold sparks of fire emitted from thy<br>frame. Stop without delay these sparks of fire and extinguish the<br>dazzling radiance of thy eyes. O son of Vinata, slacken this exceeding<br>speed of thy course. O devourer of snakes, I have no business to go with<br>thee. Desist, O blessed one, I am unable to bear this speed of thine. I<br>have promised to give my preceptor eight hundred white steeds of lunar<br>effulgence, each having one ear black in hue. I see no way, O oviparous<br>being, of fulfilling my pledge. There is but one way that I can see, and<br>that is to lay down my own life. I have no wealth of my own, nor any<br>wealthy friend, nor can wealth, however immense, procure the<br>accomplishment of my object.'<br><br>"Narada continued, 'Unto Galava uttering these and many other words of<br>entreaty and sorrow, the son of Vinata, without slackening his speed,<br>laughingly replied, saying, 'Thou hast little wisdom, O regenerate Rishi,<br>since thou wishest to put an end to thy own life. Death can never be<br>brought about by one's effort. Indeed, Death is God himself. Why didst<br>thou not, before this, inform me of thy purpose? There are excellent<br>means by which all this may be accomplished. Here is this mountain called<br>Rishabha on the seaside. Resting here for some time and refreshing<br>ourselves with food, I will, O Galava, return.'"
