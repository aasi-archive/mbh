                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Dismissed with salutation by the Pandavas, Sanjaya<br>set out for (Hastinapura) having executed all the commands of the<br>illustrious Dhritarashtra. Reaching Hastinapura he quickly entered it,<br>and presented himself at the gate of the inner apartments of the palace.<br>Addressing the porter, he said, 'O gate-keeper, say unto Dhritarashtra<br>that I, Sanjaya, have just arrived, coming from the sons of Pandu. Do not<br>delay. If the king be awake, then only shouldst thou say so, O keeper,<br>for I like to enter having first apprised him of my arrival. In the<br>present instance I have something of very great importance to<br>communicate.' Hearing this, the gate-keeper went to the king and<br>addressed him, saying, 'O lord of earth, I bow to thee. Sanjaya is at thy<br>gates, desirous of seeing thee. He cometh, bearing a message from the<br>Pandavas. Issue your commands, O king, as to what he should do.'<br><br>"The king said, 'Tell Sanjaya that I am happy and hale. Let him enter.<br>Welcome to Sanjaya. I am always ready to receive him. Why should he stay<br>outside whose admission is never forbidden?"<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then, with the king's permission, having<br>entered that spacious apartment, the Suta's son, with joined hands,<br>approached the royal son of Vichitravirya who was protected by many wise,<br>valiant, and righteous persons, and who was then seated on his throne.<br>And Sanjaya addressed him, saying, 'I am Sanjaya, O king. I bow unto<br>thee. O chief of men, proceeding hence I found the sons of Pandu. After<br>having paid his salutations to thee, Pandu's son, the intelligent<br>Yudhishthira, enquired of thy welfare. And well-pleased, he also<br>enquireth after thy sons, and asketh thee whether thou art happy with thy<br>sons and grandsons and friends and counsellors, and, O king, all those<br>that depend upon thee.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'O child, giving my blessings to Ajatasatru, I ask<br>thee, O Sanjaya, whether that king of the Kauravas, Pritha's son, is well<br>with his sons and brothers and counsellors.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Pandu's son is well with his counsellors. He desires<br>possessions of that which he formerly had as his own. He seeketh virtue<br>and wealth without doing anything that is censurable, possesseth<br>intelligence and vast learning, and is, besides, far-sighted and of<br>excellent disposition. With that son of Pandu, abstention from injury is<br>even superior to virtue, and virtue superior to the accumulation of<br>wealth. His mind, O Bharata, is always inclined to happiness and joy, and<br>to such course of action as are virtuous and conducive to the higher ends<br>of life. Even like doll pulled this way and that by threads, man (in this<br>world) moveth, swayed by a force not his own. Beholding the sufferings of<br>Yudhishthira, I regard the force of destiny to be Superior to the effect<br>of human exertion. Beholding again thy unworthy deeds, which, besides,<br>being highly sinful and unspeakable, are sure to terminate in misery, it<br>seemeth to me that one of thy nature winneth praise only so long as his<br>able foe bideth his time. Renouncing all sin, even as a serpent casteth<br>off its worn out slough which it cannot any longer retain, the heroic<br>Ajatasatru shineth in his natural perfection, leaving his load of sins to<br>be borne by thee. Consider, O king, thy own acts which are contrary to<br>both religion and profit, and to the behaviour of those that are<br>righteous. Thou hast, O king, earned a bad repute in this world, and wilt<br>reap misery in the next. Obeying the counsels of thy son thou hopest to<br>enjoy this doubtful property, keeping them aloof. This unrighteous deed<br>is loudly bruited about in the world, Therefore, O foremost of the<br>Bharatas, this deed is unworthy of thee. Calamity overtaketh him who is<br>deficient in wisdom, or who is of low birth, or who is cruel, or who<br>cherisheth hostility for a long time, or who is not steady in Kshatriya<br>virtues, or is devoid of energy, or is of a bad disposition, in fact, him<br>who hath such marks. It is by virtue of luck that a person taketh his<br>birth in good race, or becometh strong, or famous, or versed in various<br>lore, or possesseth the comforts of life, or becometh capable of subduing<br>his senses, or discriminating virtue and vice that are always linked<br>together. What person is there, who, attended upon by foremost of<br>counsellors, possessed of intelligence, capable of discriminating between<br>virtue and vice in times of distress, not destitute of the rituals of<br>religion, and retaining the use of all his faculties, would commit cruel<br>deeds. These counsellors, ever devoted to thy work, wait here united<br>together. Even this is their firm determination (viz., that the Pandavas<br>are not to get back their share). The destruction of the Kurus,<br>therefore, is certain to be brought about by the force of circumstances.<br>If, provoked by the offences, Yudhishthira wisheth for misery to thee,<br>then Kurus will be destroyed prematurely, while, imparting all his sins<br>to thee, the blame of that deed will be thine in this world. Indeed, what<br>else is there save the will of the Gods, for Arjuna, the son of Pritha,<br>leaving this world ascended to the very heavens and was honoured there<br>very greatly. This proves that individual exertion is nothing. There is,<br>no doubt, as to this. Seeing that the attributes of high birth, bravery,<br>etc., depended for their development or otherwise on acts, and beholding<br>also prosperity and adversity and stability and instability (in persons<br>and their possessions), king Vali, in his search after causes, having<br>failed to discover a beginning (in the chain of acts of former lives one<br>before another), regarded the eternal Essence to be the cause of<br>everything. The eye, the ear, the nose, the touch, and the tongue, these<br>are the doors of a person's knowledge. If desire be curbed, these would<br>be gratified by themselves. Therefore, cheerfully and without repining<br>one should control the senses. Others there are that think differently.<br>They hold that if a person's acts are well-applied, these must produce<br>the desired result. Thus the child begot by the act of the mother and the<br>father grows when duly tended with food and drink. Men in this world<br>become subject to love and hate, pleasure and pain, praise and blame. A<br>man is praised when he behaves honestly. Thee I blame, since these<br>dissensions of the Bharatas (whose root thou art) will surely bring about<br>the destruction of innumerable lives. If peace be not concluded, then<br>through thy fault Arjuna will consume the Kurus like a blazing fire<br>consuming a heap of dried grass. O ruler of men, thou alone of all the<br>world, yielding to thy son whom no restraints can blind, hadst regarded<br>thyself as crowned with success and abstained from avoiding dispute at<br>the time of the match at dice. Behold now the fruit of that (weakness of<br>thine)! O monarch, by rejecting advisers that are faithful and accepting<br>those that deserve no confidence, this extensive and prosperous empire, O<br>son of Kuru, thou art unable to retain owing to thy weakness. Wearied by<br>my fast journey and very much fatigued, I solicit thy permission to go to<br>bed now, O lion of men, for tomorrow morning will the Kurus, assembled<br>together in the council-hall, hear the words of Ajatasatru.'"
