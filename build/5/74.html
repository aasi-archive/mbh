                            "Bhima said, 'Speak thou, O slayer of Madhu, in such a strain that there<br>may be peace with the Kurus. Do not threaten them with war. Resenting<br>everything, his wrath always excited, hostile to his own good and<br>arrogant, Duryodhana should not be roughly addressed. Do thou behave<br>towards him with mildness. Duryodhana is by nature sinful of heart like<br>that of a robber, intoxicated with the pride of prosperity, hostile to<br>the Pandavas, without foresight, cruel in speech, always disposed to<br>censure others, of wicked prowess, of wrath not easily to be appeased,<br>not susceptible of being taught, of wicked soul, deceitful in behaviour,<br>capable of giving up his very life rather than break or give up his own<br>opinion. Peace with such a one, O Krishna, is, I suppose, most difficult.<br>Regardless of the words of even his well-wishers, destitute of virtue,<br>loving falsehood, he always acts against the words of his counsellors and<br>wounds their hearts. Like a serpent hid within reeds, he naturally<br>commits sinful acts, depending on his own wicked disposition, and<br>obedient to the impulse of wrath. What army Duryodhana hath, what his<br>conduct is, what his nature, what his might, and what his prowess, are<br>all well-known to thee. Before this, the Kauravas with their son passed<br>their days in cheerfulness, and we also with our friends rejoiced like<br>the younger brother of Indra, with Indra himself. Alas, by Duryodhana's<br>wrath, O slayer of Madhu, the Bharatas will all be consumed, even like<br>forests by fire at the end of the dewy seasons, and, O slayer of Madhu,<br>well-known are those eighteen kings that annihilated their kinsmen,<br>friends, and relatives. Even as, when Dharma became extinct, Kali was<br>born in the race of Asuras flourishing with prosperity and blazing with<br>energy, so was born Udavarta among the Haihayas. Janamejaya among the<br>Nepas, Vahula among the Talajanghas, proud Vasu among the Krimis,<br>Ajavindu among the Suviras, Rushardhik among the Surashtras, Arkaja among<br>the Valihas, Dhautamulaka among the Chinas, Hayagriva among the Videhas,<br>Varayu among the Mahaujasas, Vahu among the Sundaras, Pururavas among the<br>Diptakshas, Sahaja among the Chedis and Matsyas, Vrishaddhaja among the<br>Praviras, Dharana among the Chandra-batsyas, Bigahana among the Mukutas<br>and Sama among the Nandivegas. These vile individuals, O Krishna, spring<br>up, at the end of each Yuga, in their respective races, for the<br>destruction of their kinsmen. So hath Duryodhana, the very embodiment of<br>sin and the disgrace of his race, been born, at the end of the Yuga,<br>amongst us the Kurus. Therefore, O thou of fierce prowess, thou shouldst<br>address him slowly and mildly, not in bitter but sweet words fraught with<br>virtue and profit, and discourse fully on the subject so as to attract<br>his heart. All of us, O Krishna, would rather in humiliation follow<br>Duryodhana submissively, but, oh, let not the Bharatas be annihilated. O<br>Vasudeva, act in such a way that we may rather live as strangers to the<br>Kurus than incurring the sin of bringing about the destruction of the<br>whole race should touch them, O Krishna, let the aged Grandsire and the<br>other counsellors of the Kurus be asked to bring about brotherly feelings<br>between brothers and to pacify the son of Dhritarashtra. Even this is<br>what I say. King Yudhishthira also approveth of this, and Arjuna too is<br>averse to war, for there is great compassion in him.'"
