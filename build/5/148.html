                            "Vasudeva said, 'After Bhishma had said these words, Drona, always<br>competent to speak, then addressed Duryodhana in the midst of the<br>(assembled) monarchs and said these words that are beneficial to thee.<br>And he said, 'O sire, as Pratipa's son, Santanu, was devoted to the<br>welfare of his race, and as Devavrata, otherwise called Bhishma was<br>devoted to the welfare of his race, so was the royal Pandu, that king of<br>the Kurus, who was firmly devoted to truth, who had his passions under<br>control, who was virtuous, of excellent vows, and attentive to all<br>duties. (Though king by right) that perpetuator of Kuru's race yet made<br>over the sovereignty to his elder brother, Dhritarashtra, endued with<br>great wisdom, and to his younger brother Kshattri (Vidura). And placing<br>this Dhritarashtra of unfading glory on the throne, that royal son of<br>Kuru's race went to the woods with his two wives. And that tiger among<br>men, Vidura, with great humility, placing himself in subjection to<br>Dhritarashtra, began to wait on him like a slave, fanning him with the<br>branch of a tender palm. And all the subjects then, O sire, duly tendered<br>their submission to king Dhritarashtra just as they had done to king<br>Pandu himself. And having made over the kingdom to Dhritarashtra and<br>Vidura, that conqueror of hostile cities, Pandu, wandered over the whole<br>earth. Always devoted to truth, Vidura then took charge of the finances,<br>gifts, superintendence of the servants (of the state), and the feeding of<br>all, while that conqueror of hostile cities, Bhishma, of mighty energy,<br>supervised the making of war and peace and the necessity of making or<br>withholding gifts to kings. When king Dhritarashtra of great strength was<br>on the throne, the high-souled Vidura was near him. Born in<br>Dhritarashtra's race how dost thou venture to bring about a disunion in<br>the family? Uniting with thy brothers (the Pandavas) enjoy all objects of<br>enjoyment. O king, I do not say this to you from cowardice, nor for the<br>sake of wealth. I am enjoying the wealth that Bhishma gave me, and not<br>thou, O best of kings. I do not desire, O king, to have from thee my<br>means of sustenance. Where Bhishma is, there Drona must be. Do what<br>Bhishma hath told thee. O grinder of foes, give unto the sons of Pandu<br>half the kingdom. O sire, I acted as their preceptor as much as thine.<br>Indeed, even as Aswatthaman is to me, so is Arjuna of white steeds. What<br>use is there of much declamation? Victory is there where righteousness<br>is.'<br><br>"Vasudeva continued, 'After Drona, of immeasurable energy, had said this,<br>the virtuous Vidura then, O king, who is devoted to truth, said these<br>words, turning towards his uncle (Bhishma) and looking at his face. And<br>Vidura said, 'O Devavrata, attend to the words I speak. This race of<br>Kuru, when it became extinct, was revived by thee. It is for this that<br>thou art indifferent to my lamentations now. In this our race, its stain<br>is this Duryodhana, whose inclinations are followed by thee, although he<br>is enslaved by avarice, and is wicked and ungrateful and deprived of his<br>senses by lust. The Kurus will certainly bear consequence of the acts of<br>that Duryodhana who transgresseth the command of his father, observant of<br>virtue and profit. O great king, act thou so that the Kurus may not<br>perish. Like a painter producing a picture, it was thou, O king, who<br>hadst caused me and Dhritarashtra to spring into life. The Creator,<br>having created creatures, destroys them again. Do not act like him.<br>Seeing before thy very eyes this extinction of thy race, be not<br>indifferent to it. If, however, thy understanding is gone in consequence<br>of the universal slaughter that is at hand, go then to the woods, taking<br>me and Dhritarashtra with thee. Otherwise, binding this very day wicked<br>Duryodhana that hath deceit for his wisdom, rule this kingdom with the<br>sons of Pandu guarding it around. Relent, O tiger among kings. A great<br>slaughter of the Pandavas, the Kurus, and of other kings of immeasurable<br>energy is before us.'<br><br>'Having said this, Vidura ceased, his heart overflowing with sorrow. And<br>reflecting on the matter, he began to draw repeated sighs. Then the<br>daughter of king Suvala, alarmed at the prospect of the destruction of a<br>whole race, said, from wrath, these words fraught with virtue and profit,<br>to cruel Duryodhana of wicked heart, in the presence of the assembled<br>monarchs, 'Let all the kings present in this royal assembly and let the<br>regenerate Rishis that form the other members of this conclave, listen<br>(to me) as I proclaim the guilt of thy sinful self backed by all thy<br>counsellors. The kingdom of the Kurus is enjoyable in due order of<br>succession. Even this hath always been the custom of our race. Of sinful<br>soul and exceedingly wicked in acts, thou seekest the destruction of the<br>Kuru kingdom by thy unrighteousness. Wise Dhritarashtra is in possession<br>of the kingdom, having Vidura of great foresight under him (as his<br>adviser). Passing over these two, why, O Duryodhana, dost thou, from<br>delusion, covet the sovereignty now? Even the high-souled king and<br>Kshattri, when Bhishma is alive, should both be subordinate to him.<br>Indeed, this foremost of men, this offspring of Ganga, the high-souled<br>Bhishma, in consequence of his righteousness, doth not desire the<br>sovereignty. It is for this reason that this invincible kingdom became<br>Pandu's. His sons, therefore, are masters today and no other. The<br>extensive kingdom, then by paternal right, belongeth to the Pandavas, and<br>their sons and grandsons in due order. Observing the customs of our race<br>and the rule with respect to our kingdom, we all fully accomplish that<br>which this high-souled and wise chief of the Kurus, Devavrata, firmly<br>adhering to truth, sayeth, 'Let this king (Dhritarashtra) and Vidura<br>also, at the command of Bhishma of great vows, proclaim the same thing.<br>Even that is an act that should be done by those that are well-wishers<br>(of this race). Keeping virtue in front, let Yudhishthira, the son of<br>Dharma, guided by king Dhritarashtra and urged by Santanu's son, rule for<br>many long years this kingdom of the Kurus lawfully obtainable by him.'"
