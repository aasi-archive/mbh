                            "Janamejaya said, 'Hearing that Yudhishthira had, with his troops marched<br>from the desire of battle and encamped on Kurukshetra, protected by<br>Vasudeva, and aided by Virata and Drupada with their sons, and surrounded<br>by the Kekayas, the Vrishnis, and other kings by hundreds, and watched<br>over by numerous mighty car-warriors, like the great Indra himself by the<br>Adityas, what measures were concerted by king Duryodhana? O high-souled<br>one, I desire to hear in detail all that happened in Kurujangala on that<br>frightful occasion. The son of Pandu, with Vasudeva and Virata and<br>Drupada and Dhrishtadyumna, the Panchala prince and that mighty<br>car-warrior Sikhandin and powerful Yudhamanyu, incapable of being<br>resisted by the very gods, might trouble the deities themselves in battle<br>with Indra at their head. I, therefore, desire to hear in detail, O thou<br>that art possessed of wealth of asceticism, all the acts of the Kurus and<br>the Pandavas as they had happened.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'When he of Dasarha's race had departed (from the<br>Kuru court), king Duryodhana, addressing Karna and Dussasana and Sakuni,<br>said these words, 'Kesava hath gone to the sons of Pritha, without having<br>been able to achieve his object. Filled with wrath as he is, he will<br>surely stimulate the Pandavas. A battle between myself and Pandavas is<br>much desired by Vasudeva. Bhimasena and Arjuna are ever of the same mind<br>with him. Yudhishthira, again, is very much under the influence of<br>Bhimasena. Before this, Yudhishthira with all his brothers was persecuted<br>by me. Virata and Drupada whom I had waged hostilities with, obedient to<br>Vasudeva, both of them have become the leaders of Yudhishthira's host.<br>The battle, therefore, that will take place, will be a fierce and<br>terrific one. Casting off all sloth, cause every preparation to be made<br>for the encounter. Let the kings (my allies) pitch their tents by<br>hundreds and thousands on Kurukshetra, all of which must be spacious,<br>incapable of being approached by enemies, near enough to places abounding<br>with water and fuel, in such positions that the communications thereto<br>for sending supplies may not be stopped at any time by the foe,&#8212;full of<br>weapons of diverse kinds, and decked with streamers and flags. Let the<br>road from our city to the camp be made level for their march. Let it be<br>proclaimed this very day, without loss of time, that our march will<br>commence tomorrow.' (Hearing these words of the king), they said, 'So be<br>it,'&#8212;and when the morrow came, those high-souled persons did everything<br>they had been commanded to do for the accommodation of the monarchs. And<br>all those monarchs (meanwhile), hearing the king's command, rose up from<br>their costly seats, with wrath having the foe for its objects. And they<br>began to slowly rub their mace-like arms, blazing with bracelets of gold,<br>and decked with the paste of sandal and other fragrant substances. And<br>they also commenced, with those lotus-like hands of theirs, to wear their<br>head-gears and lower and upper garments and diverse kinds of ornaments.<br>And many foremost of car-warriors began to superintend the furnishing of<br>their cars, and persons conversant with horse-lore began to harness their<br>steeds, while those versed in matters relating to elephants began to<br>equip those huge animals. And all those warriors began to wear diverse<br>kinds of beautiful armour made of gold, and arm themselves with diverse<br>weapons. And the foot-soldiers began to take up various kinds of arms and<br>case their bodies in various kinds of armour decorated with gold. And, O<br>Bharata. the city of Duryodhana then, filled as it was with rejoicing<br>millions, wore the bright aspect of a festive occasion. And, O king, the<br>Kuru capital at the prospect of battle looked like the ocean on the<br>appearance of the moon, with the vast crowds of humanity representing its<br>waters with their eddies; the cars, elephants, and horses representing<br>its fishes; the tumult of conchs and drums, its roar; the<br>treasure-chests, its jewels and gems; the diverse kinds of ornaments and<br>armour its waves; the bright weapons its white foam; the rows of houses<br>the mountains on its beach; and the roads and shops, like lakes!'"
