                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Having beard these words of king Dhritarashtra<br>Sanjaya went to Upaplavya to see the Pandavas of immeasurable strength.<br>And having approached king Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, he made<br>obeisance to him first and then spoke. And the son of Gavalgana, by name<br>Sanjaya and by caste a Suta, cheerfully spoke unto Ajatasatru, 'How<br>lucky, O king, that I see you hale, attended by friends and little<br>inferior to the great Indra. The aged and wise king Dhritarashtra, the<br>son of Ambika, hath enquired about your welfare. I hope Bhimasena is<br>well, and that Dhananjaya, that foremost of the Pandavas, and these two<br>sons of Madri, are well. I hope princess Krishna also, the daughter of<br>Drupada, is well,&#8212;she who never swerves from the path of truth, that<br>lady of great energy, that wife of heroes. I hope she is well with her<br>sons,&#8212;she in whom are centred all your dearest joys and whose welfare<br>you constantly pray for.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O Sanjaya, the son of Gavalgana, hath thy journey<br>here been safe? We are pleased with thy sight. I ask thee in return how<br>thou art. I am, O learned man, in excellent health with my younger<br>brothers. O Suta, after a long while do I now receive news of the aged<br>king of the Kurus, that descendant of Bharata. Having seen thee, O<br>Sanjaya, I feel as if I have seen the king himself, so pleased I am! Is<br>our aged grandsire Bhishma, the descendant of Kuru, endued with great<br>energy and the highest wisdom and always devoted to the practices of his<br>own order, O sire, in health? I hope he still retains all his former<br>habits. I hope the high-souled king Dhritarashtra, the so-n of<br>Vichitravirya, is in health with his sons. I hope the great king Vahlika,<br>the son of Pratipa, endued with great learning, is also in health. I<br>hope, O sire, that Somadatta is in health, and Bhurisravas, and<br>Satyasandha, and Sala, and Drona with his son, and the Brahmana Kripa are<br>also well. I hope all those mighty bowmen are free from disease. O<br>Sanjaya, all those greatest and best of bowmen, endued with the highest<br>intelligence and versed in letters, and occupying the very top of those<br>who wield weapons, have attached themselves to the Kurus. I hope those<br>bowmen receive their honours due. I hope they are free from disease. How<br>happy are they in whose kingdom dwells the mighty and handsome bowman,<br>the well-behaved son of Drona! I hope Yuyutsu, the highly intelligent son<br>of Dhritarashtra by his Vaisya wife is in health. I hope, O sire, the<br>adviser Karna, whose counsels are followed by the dull-headed Suyodhana,<br>is in health. I hope, the aged ladies, the mothers of the Bharata race,<br>and the kitchen-maidens, the bond-maids, the daughters-in-law, the boys,<br>the sister's sons, and 'the sisters, and the daughters' sons of<br>Dhritarashtra's house are all free from trouble. O sire, I hope the king<br>still allows their former subsistence to the Brahmanas. I hope, O<br>Sanjaya, Dhritarashtra's son hath not seized those gifts to the Brahmanas<br>that I made. I hope Dhritarashtra with his sons meets in a spirit of<br>forbearance any over-bearing conduct on the part of the Brahmanas. I hope<br>he never neglects to make provision for them, that being the sole highway<br>to heaven. For this is the excellent and clear light that hath been<br>provided by the Creator in this world of living beings. If like<br>dull-headed persons, the sons of Kuru do not treat the Brahmanas in a<br>forbearing spirit, wholesale destruction will overtake them. I hope king<br>Dhritarashtra and his son try to provide for the functionaries of state.<br>I hope there are no enemies for theirs, who, disguised as friends, are<br>conspiring for their ruin. O sire, I hope none of these Kurus talk of our<br>having committed any crimes. I hope Drona and his son and the heroic<br>Kripa do not talk of our having been guilty in any way. I hope all the<br>Kurus look up to king Dhritarashtra and his sons as the protectors of<br>their tribe. I hope when they see a horde of robbers, they remember the<br>deeds of Arjuna, the leader in all fields of battle. I hope they remember<br>the arrows shot from the Gandiva, which course through the air in a<br>straight path, impelled onwards by the stretched bow-string in contact<br>with the fingers of his hand, and making a noise loud as that of the<br>thunder. I have not seen the warrior that excels or even rivals Arjuna<br>who can shoot by a single effort of his hand sixty-one whetted and<br>keen-edged shafts furnished with excellent feathers. Do they remember<br>Bhima also, who, endued with great activity causeth hostile hosts arrayed<br>in battle to tremble in dread, like an elephant with rent temples<br>agitating a forest of reeds? Do they remember the mighty Sahadeva, the<br>son of Madri, who in Dantakura conquered the Kalingas, shooting arrows by<br>both the left and right hand? Do they remember Nakula, who, O Sanjaya,<br>was sent, under your eye, to conquer the Sivis and the Trigartas, and who<br>brought the western region under my power? Do they remember the disgrace<br>that was theirs when under evil counsels they came to the woods of<br>Dwaitavana on pretence of taking away their cattle? Those wicked ones<br>having been over-powered by their enemies were afterwards liberated by<br>Bhimasena and Arjuna, myself protecting the rear of Arjuna (in the fight<br>that ensued) and Bhima protecting the rear of the sons of Madri, and the<br>wielder of the Gandiva coming out unharmed from the press of battle<br>having made a great slaughter of the hostile host,&#8212;do they remember<br>that? It is not by a single good deed, O Sanjaya, that happiness can here<br>be attained, when by all our endeavours we are unable to win over the son<br>of Dhritarashtra!"
