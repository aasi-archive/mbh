                            "Kunti said, 'Say unto Arjuna, these words, when thou wert brought forth<br>in the lying-in room and when I was sitting in the hermitage surrounded<br>by ladies, a celestial and delightful voice was heard in the sky, saying,<br>'O Kunti, this thy son will rival the deity of a thousand eyes. This one<br>will vanquish in battle all the assembled Kurus. Aided by Bhima, he will<br>conquer the whole Earth and his fame will touch the very heavens. With<br>Vasudeva as his ally, he will slay the Kurus in battle and recover his<br>lost paternal share in the kingdom. Endued with great prosperity, he<br>will, with his brothers, perform three great sacrifices.' O thou of<br>unfading glory, thou knowest how steady, in truth, is Vibhatsu, otherwise<br>called Savyasachin, how irresistible he is. O thou of Dasarha's race, let<br>it be as that (celestial) voice said. If, O thou of Vrishni's race, there<br>is anything like righteousness, those words will be true, for then,<br>Krishna, thou wilt thyself accomplish it all. I do not doubt what that<br>voice said. I bow to righteousness which is superior to all. It is<br>righteousness that supports all creatures. Thou shalt say these words<br>unto Dhananjaya. Unto Vrikodara again, who is always ready for exertion,<br>thou shalt say these words, 'The time hath come for that in view of which<br>Kshatriya lady bringeth forth a son! They that are foremost among men<br>never become cheerless when they have hostilities to wage&#8212;Thou knowest<br>what the state of Bhima's mind is. That grinder of foes is never pacified<br>until he exterminates his foes. Thou shalt, O Madhava, next say unto the<br>auspicious Krishna of great fame, that daughter-in-law of the high-souled<br>Pandu, who is conversant with the details of every virtue, these words,<br>'O thou that art highly blessed, O thou of noble parentage, O thou that<br>art endued with great fame, that becoming behaviour which thou always<br>showest towards my sons is, indeed, worthy of thee.' Thou must also say<br>unto the sons of Madri who are always devoted to Kshatriya virtues, these<br>words, 'Covet ye more than life itself, those enjoyments that are<br>acquired by prowess. Objects won by prowess always please the heart of a<br>person that liveth according to Kshatriya practices. Engaged as ye are in<br>acquiring every kind of virtue, before your eyes the princess of Panchala<br>was addressed in cruel and abusive epithets. Who is there that can<br>forgive that insult? The deprivation of their kingdom grieved me not.<br>Their defeat at dice grieved me not. But that noble and fair Draupadi,<br>however, while weeping in the midst of the assembly, had to hear those<br>cruel and insulting words is what grieveth me most. Alas, exceedingly<br>beautiful Krishna, ever devoted to Kshatriya virtues, found no protector<br>on that occasion, though she was wedded to such powerful protectors. O<br>thou of mighty arms, say unto that tiger among men, Arjuna, that foremost<br>of all wielders of weapons, that he should always tread in the path that<br>may be pointed out by Draupadi. Thou knowest it very well, Kesava, that<br>Bhima and Arjuna,&#8212;that pair of fierce and all-destroying Yamas, are<br>capable of making the very gods go the way of all creatures. Is not this<br>an insult to them that (their wife) Krishna was dragged into the<br>assembly? O Kesava, recall to their remembrance all those cruel and harsh<br>words that Dussasana said unto Bhima in the very presence of all the<br>warriors of Kuru's race. Enquire (in my name) after the welfare of the<br>Pandavas with their children and Krishna. Say unto them, O Janardana,<br>that I am well. Go thou on thy auspicious way, and protect my sons!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Saluting and walking round her, the<br>mighty-armed Krishna whose gait resembled the majestic gait of the lion,<br>then issued out of Pritha's abode. And he then dismissed those chiefs<br>among the Kurus with Bhishma at their head (who had followed him), and<br>taking Karna upon his chariot, left (the Kuru city), accompanied by<br>Satyaki. And after he of Dasarha's race had departed, the Kurus assembled<br>together and began to talk of that highly wonderful and marvellous<br>incident connected with him. And they said, 'Overcome with ignorance, the<br>whole earth hath been entangled in the meshes of death!' And they also<br>said, 'Through Duryodhana's folly, all this is doomed to destruction.'<br><br>'Having issued out of the (Kuru) city, that foremost of persons<br>proceeded, deliberating with Karna for a long time. And that delighter of<br>all the Yadavas then dismissed Karna and urged his steeds to greater<br>speed. And driven by Daruka, those swift coursers endued with the speed<br>of the tempest of the mind, went on as if drinking the skies. And quickly<br>traversing a long way like fleet hawks, they reached Upaplavya very soon,<br>bearing the wielder of Saranga.'"
