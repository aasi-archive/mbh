                            "Janamejaya said, 'When Yudhishthira heard that Bhishma, the high-souled<br>son of Ganga, the foremost of all wielders of weapons, the grandsire of<br>the Bharatas, the head of all the kings, the rival of Vrihaspati in<br>intellect, resembling the ocean in gravity, the mountains of Himavat in<br>calmness, the Creator himself in nobleness, and the sun in energy, and<br>capable of slaying hostile hosts like great Indra himself by showering<br>his arrows, was installed, till his removal by death, in the command of<br>the Kuru army on the eve of the great sacrifice of battle, terrific in<br>its mien and capable of making one's hairs stand on their ends, what did<br>that mighty-armed son of Pandu, that foremost of wielders of weapons,<br>say? What also did Bhima and Arjuna say? And what too did Krishna say?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'When news was received of this, Yudhishthira endued<br>with great intelligence and well-acquainted with what should be done in<br>view of dangers and calamities summoned all his brothers and also the<br>eternal Vasudeva (to his presence). And that foremost of speakers then<br>said in a mild voice, 'Make your rounds among the soldiers, and remain<br>carefully, casing yourselves in mail. Our first encounter will be with<br>our grandsire. Look ye for (seven) leaders for the seven Akshauhinis of<br>my troops.'<br><br>"Krishna said, 'Those words of grave import, which, O bull of the Bharata<br>race, it behoveth thee to utter on an occasion like this, have, indeed,<br>been uttered by thee. Even this, O mighty armed one, is what I also like.<br>Let therefore, that be done which should be done next. Let, indeed, seven<br>leaders be selected for thy army.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Summoning then those warriors eager for battle,<br>viz., Drupada and Virata, and that bull of Sini's race, and<br>Dhrishtadyumna the prince of Panchala, and king Dhrishtaketu, and prince<br>Shikhandi of Panchala, and Sahadeva, the ruler of the Magadhas,<br>Yudhishthira duly appointed them in the command of his seven divisions.<br>And above them all was placed in command of all the troops that<br>Dhrishtadyumna who had sprung from the blazing (sacrificial) fire for the<br>destruction of Drona. And Dhananjaya, of curly hair, was made the leader<br>of all those high-souled leaders. And handsome Janardana endued with<br>great intelligence, he who was the younger brother of Sankarshana, was<br>chosen as the guide of Arjuna and the driver of his steeds.'<br><br>"And beholding that a very destructive battle was about to take place,<br>there came, O king, into the Pandava encampment, Halayudha, accompanied<br>by Akrura, and Gada and Samva, and Uddhava, and Rukmini's son<br>(Pradyumna), and Ahuka's sons, and Charudeshna, and others. And<br>surrounded and guarded by those foremost warriors of the Vrishni race,<br>resembling a herd of mighty tigers, like Vasava in the midst of the<br>Maruts, the mighty-armed and handsome Rama, attired in garments of blue<br>silk and resembling the peak of the Kailasa mountain, and endued with the<br>sportive gait of the lion and possessed of eyes having their ends<br>reddened with drink, came there (at such a time). And beholding him, king<br>Yudhishthira the Just, and Kesava of great effulgence, and Pritha's son<br>Vrikodara of terrible deeds, and (Arjuna) the wielder of Gandiva, and all<br>the other kings that were, rose from their seats. And they all offered<br>worship unto Halayudha as he came to that place. And the Pandava king<br>touched Rama's hands with his own. And that chastiser of foes, Halayudha,<br>in return, accosting them all with Vasudeva at their head, and saluting<br>(respectfully) both Virata and Drupada who were senior in years, sat down<br>on the same seat with Yudhishthira. And after all the kings had taken<br>their seats, Rohini's son, casting his eyes on Vasudeva, began to speak.<br>And he said, 'This fierce and terrible slaughter is inevitable. It is,<br>without doubt, a decree of fate, and I think that it cannot be averted.<br>Let me hope, however, to behold all of you, with your friends, come<br>safely out of this strife, with sound bodies and perfectly hale. Without<br>doubt, all the Kshatriyas of the world that are assembled together have<br>their hour come. A fierce melee covering with a mire of flesh and blood<br>is sure to take place. I said unto Vasudeva repeatedly in private, 'O<br>slayer of Madhu, unto those that bear equal relationship to us, observe<br>thou an equal behaviour. As are the Pandavas to us, even so is king<br>Duryodhana. Therefore, give him also the same aid. Indeed, he repeatedly<br>soliciteth it. For thy sake, however, the slayer of Madhu regarded not my<br>words. Looking at Dhananjaya, he hath with his whole heart, been devoted<br>to your cause. Even this is what I certainly think, viz., that the<br>victory of the Pandavas is sure, for Vasudeva's wish, O Bharata, is even<br>so. As regards myself, I dare not cast my eyes on the world without<br>Krishna (on my side). It is for this that I follow whatever Krishna<br>seeketh to achieve. Both of these heroes, well-skilled in encounter with<br>the mace, are my disciples. My affection, therefore, for Bhima is equal<br>to that for king Duryodhana. For these reasons, I shall now repair to the<br>tirtha of the Saraswati for ablutions, for I shall not be able to behold<br>with indifference the destruction of the Kauravas.<br><br>"Having said this, the mighty-armed Rama, obtaining the leave of the<br>Pandavas, and making the slayer of Madhu desist (from following him<br>farther), set out on his journey for the sacred waters.'"
