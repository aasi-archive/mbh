                            (Sanat-sujata Parva)<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'If there is anything still left unsaid by thee, O<br>Vidura, say it then, as I am ready to listen to thee. The discourse is,<br>indeed, charming.'<br><br>"Vidura. said, 'O Dhritarashtra, O thou of the Bharata race, that ancient<br>and immortal Rishi Sanat-sujata who, leading a life perpetual celibacy,<br>hath said that there is no Death,&#8212;that foremost of all intelligent<br>persons,&#8212;will expound to thee all the doubts, in thy mind, both<br>expressed and unexpressed.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Dost thou not know what that immortal Rishi will<br>say unto me? O Vidura, do thou say it, if indeed, thou hast that degree<br>of wisdom.'<br><br>"Vidura said, 'I am born in the Sudra order and, therefore, do not<br>venture to say more than what I have already said. The understanding,<br>however, of that Rishi leading a life of celibacy, is regarded by me to<br>be infinite. He that is a Brahmana by birth, by discoursing on even the<br>profoundest mysteries, never incureth the censure of the gods. It is for<br>this alone that I do not discourse to thee, upon the subject.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Tell me, O Vidura, how with this body of mine I can<br>meet with that ancient and immortal one?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana said, 'Then Vidura began to think of that Rishi of rigid<br>vows. And knowing that he was thought of, the Rishi, O Bharata, showed<br>himself there. Vidura then received him with the rites prescribed by<br>ordinance. And when, having rested a while, the Rishi was seated at his<br>ease, Vidura addressed him, saying, 'O illustrious one, there is a doubt<br>in Dhritarashtra's mind which is incapable of being explained away by me.<br>It behoveth thee, therefore, to expound it, so that listening to thy<br>discourse, this chief of men may tide over all this sorrows, and to that<br>gain and loss, what is agreeable and what disagreeable, decrepitude and<br>death, fright and jealously, hunger and thirst, pride and prosperity,<br>dislike, sleep, lust and wrath, and decrease and increase may all be<br>borne by him!'"
