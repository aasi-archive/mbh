                            "Narada said, 'Garuda then, that foremost of winged beings, addressed the<br>cheerless Galava and said, 'Because it is created by Agni, in the bowels<br>of the earth and augmented by Vayu, and because also the earth itself is<br>said to be Hiranmaya, therefore, is wealth called Hiranya. And because<br>wealth supports the world and sustains life, therefore, is it called<br>Dhana. It is for serving these ends that Dhana (wealth) exists from the<br>beginning in the three worlds. On that Friday, when either of the two<br>constellations&#8212;the Purvabhadra or the Uttarabhadra&#8212;is ascendant, Agni,<br>creating wealth by a fiat of his will, bestoweth it on mankind for the<br>increase of Kuvera's stock. The wealth that is embowelled in the Earth is<br>guarded by the deities called the Ajaikapats and the Ahivradnas, and also<br>by Kuvera. Exceedingly difficult of attainment, that wealth, therefore, O<br>bull among Brahmanas, is rarely attained. Without wealth there is no<br>chance of thy acquisition of the promised steeds. Beg thou, therefore, of<br>some king born in the race of some royal sage, who may, without<br>oppressing his subjects, crown our suit with success. There is a king<br>born in the lunar race, that is my friend. We shall go to him, for he,<br>amongst all on Earth, hath great wealth. That royal sage is known by the<br>name of Yayati, and he is the son of Nahusha. His prowess is incapable of<br>being baffled. Solicited by thee in person, and urged by me, he will give<br>what we seek, for he hath immense wealth, equal unto what belongeth to<br>Kuvera, the lord of treasures. Even thus, by accepting a gift, O learned<br>one, pay off thy debt to thy preceptor.' Talking thus, and thinking upon<br>what was best to be done, Garuda and Galava together went to king Yayati,<br>who was then in his capital called Pratisthana. The king received them<br>hospitably and gave them excellent Arghya and water to wash their feet.<br>And the king then asked them the cause of their advent. And thereupon<br>Garuda answered, saying, 'O son of Nahusha, this ocean of asceticism,<br>called Galava, is my friend. He had been, O monarch, a disciple of<br>Viswamitra for many thousand years. This holy Brahmana, when commanded by<br>Viswamitra to go away whithersoever he chose, addressed his preceptor at<br>that time, saying,&#8212;I desire to give something as preceptor's fee.<br>Knowing this one's resources to be poor, Viswamitra did not ask for<br>anything. But when he was repeatedly addressed by this Brahmana on the<br>subject of the tutorial fee, the preceptor, under a slight accession of<br>wrath, said, 'Give me eight hundred white steeds of good pedigree and of<br>lunar radiance, and each having one ear black in hue. If, O Galava, thou<br>desirest to give anything to thy preceptor, let this then be given!' It<br>was thus that Viswamitra endued with wealth of asceticism said unto him<br>in anger. And this bull among Brahmanas is on that account smarting with<br>great grief. Unable to fulfil that command (of his preceptor), he hath<br>now come to take thy shelter. O tiger among men, accepting this as alms<br>from thee, and filled once more with cheerfulness, he will, after paying<br>his preceptor's debt, devote himself again to serve ascetic penances. A<br>royal Rishi as thou art, and, therefore, endued with wealth of asceticism<br>of thy own, this Brahmana, by giving thee a portion of his wealth of<br>asceticism, will make thee richer in wealth of that kind. As many hairs,<br>O lord of men, as there are on a horse's body, so many regions of bliss,<br>O ruler of Earth, are attained by him that giveth away a horse in gift.<br>This one is as fit to accept a gift as thou art to make a gift. Let<br>therefore, thy gift in this instance be like milk deposited in a<br>conch-shell.'"
