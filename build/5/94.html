                            "Vaisampayana said, 'In such conversation between those two distinguished<br>persons, both of whom were endued with great intelligence, that night,<br>lit with bright stars, passed away. Indeed, the night passed away against<br>the wishes of the illustrious Vidura, who had been listening to the<br>varied conversation of Krishna fraught with virtue, profit, and desire,<br>and made up of delightful words and syllables of agreeable import; and<br>also those of Krishna himself, of 'immeasurable prowess, listening to<br>discourses equal in style and character. Then, at early dawn a band of<br>choristers and bards gifted with melodious voices, awoke Kesava with<br>sweet sounds of conchs and cymbals. And rising from bed, Janardana of<br>Dasarha's race, that bull amongst all the Sattwatas, went through all the<br>customary acts of the morning. And having cleansed himself by a bath,<br>recited the sacred Mantras and poured libations of clarified butter on<br>the sacrificial fire. Madhava decked his person and began to worship the<br>rising sun. And while the unvanquished Krishna of Dasarha's race was<br>still engaged in his morning devotions, Duryodhana and Suvala's son<br>Sakuni came to him and said, 'Dhritarashtra is seated in his court, with<br>all the Kurus headed by Bhishma and with all the kings of the earth. They<br>are all soliciting thy presence, O Govinda, like the celestials in heaven<br>desiring the presence of Sakra himself,&#8212;thus addressed, Govinda greeted<br>them both with sweet and courteous enquiries. And when the sun had risen<br>a little higher, Janardana, that chastiser of foes, summoning a number of<br>Brahmanas, made them presents of gold and robes and kine and steeds.<br><br>And after he had thus given away much wealth and taken his seat, his<br>driver (Daruka) came and saluted that unvanquished hero of Dasarha's<br>race. And Daruka soon returned with his master's large and blazing car<br>furnished with rows of tinkling bells and harnessed with excellent<br>steeds. And understanding that his handsome car adorned with every<br>ornament and producing a rattle, deep as the rumbling of the mighty<br>masses of clouds, was ready, the high-souled Janardana, that delighter of<br>all the Yadavas, walking round the sacred fire and a band of Brahmanas,<br>and putting on the gem known by the name of Kaustubha, and blazing with<br>beauty, surrounded by the Kurus, and well-protected by the Vrishnis,<br>mounted on it. And Vidura, conversant with all the precepts of religion,<br>followed on his own car that scion of Dasarha's race, that foremost of<br>all living creatures, that first of all persons gifted with intelligence.<br>And Duryodhana and Suvala's son Sakuni also, on one car followed Krishna,<br>that chastiser of foes. And Satyaki and Kritavarman and the other mighty<br>car-warriors of the Vrishni race, all rode behind Krishna on cars and<br>steeds and elephants. And, O king, the handsome cars of those heroes,<br>adorned with gold and drawn by excellent steeds and each producing a loud<br>rattle, as they moved forward, shone brilliantly. And Kesava, endued with<br>great intelligence, and beaming with beauty, soon came upon a broad<br>street that had previously been swept and watered, and that was fit to be<br>used by the highest of kings. And when that scion of Dasarha's race set<br>out, cymbals began to play, and conchs began to be blown, and other<br>instruments also to pour forth their music. And great number of youthful<br>heroes, foremost in the world for heroism, and possessed of lion-like<br>prowess, proceeded, surrounding Sauri's car. And many thousands of<br>soldiers, attired in a variegated dresses, bearing swords and lances and<br>axes, marched in advance of Kesava. And there were full five hundred<br>elephants, and cars by thousands, that followed that unvanquished hero of<br>Dasarha's race while he proceeded. And, O chastiser of foes, all the<br>citizens of the capital, of all ages and both sexes, desirous of<br>beholding Janardana came out into the streets. And the terraces and<br>balconies of the houses were so thronged by ladies that the houses were<br>on the point of falling down with the weight. And worshipped by the<br>Kurus, and listening to various sweet speeches, and returning the<br>greetings of all as each deserved, Kesava went along the street, casting<br>his eyes on all. And at last, when Kesava reached the Kuru court, his<br>attendants loudly blew their conchs and trumpets and filled the welkin<br>with that blare. And, thereupon, that whole assembly of kings, of<br>immeasurable prowess, trembled with delight at the expectation of soon<br>setting their eyes on Krishna. And hearing the rattle of his car, that<br>rumbled like the deep roll of rain-charged clouds, the monarchs<br>understood Krishna to be near, and the hair of their bodies stood erect<br>with delight. And having reached the gate of the court, Sauri, that bull<br>among the Satwatas, alighting from his car, that resembled the summit of<br>Kailasa, entered the court which looked like a mass of newly-risen<br>clouds, and blazed forth with beauty, and resembled the very abode of the<br>great Indra. And that illustrious hero entered the court, arm-in-arm with<br>Vidura and Satyaki on either side, and overshadowing with his own the<br>splendour of all the Kurus, like the sun overshadowing the radiance of<br>lesser lights in the firmament. And before Vasudeva sat Karna and<br>Duryodhana, while behind him were seated the Vrishnis with Kritavarman.<br>And Bhishma and Drona, and others with Dhritarashtra were on the point of<br>rising up from their seats for honouring Janardana. Indeed, as soon as<br>he, of Dasarha's race, came, the illustrious blind monarch, Drona and<br>Bhishma, all rose up from their seats. And when that mighty ruler of men,<br>king Dhritarashtra, rose up from his seat, those kings by thousands<br>around him all rose up also. And at Dhritarashtra's command, a seat<br>beautiful all over, and adorned with gold, had been kept there for<br>Krishna, And after taking his seat, Madhava smilingly greeted the king,<br>and Bhishma, and Drona, and all other rulers, each according to his age.<br>And all the kings of the earth, and all the Kurus also, beholding Kesava<br>arrived in that assembly, worshipped him duly. And as that chastiser of<br>foes, that vanquisher of hostile cities, that hero of Dasarha's race, was<br>seated there, he beheld the Rishis whom he had seen while proceeding to<br>Hastinapur, staying in the firmament. And beholding those Rishis with<br>Narada at their head, he of Dasarha's race, slowly addressed Bhishma the<br>son of Santanu, saying, 'O king, the Rishis have come to see this earthly<br>conclave of ours. Invite them with offer of seats and abundant courtesy,<br>for if they are not seated, no one here is capable of taking his seat.<br>Let proper worship, therefore, be speedily offered unto these Rishis with<br>souls under proper control. And beholding the Rishis then at the gate of<br>the palace, Santanu's son quickly ordered the servants to bring seats for<br>them. And soon enough they brought large and beautiful seats embroidered<br>with gold and set with gems. And after the Rishis. O Bharata, had taken<br>their seats and accepted the Arghyas offered to them, Krishna took his<br>seat, so also all the kings. And Dussasana gave an excellent seat to<br>Satyaki, while Vivingsati gave another golden one to Kritavarman. And not<br>far from where Krishna sat, that illustrious and wrathful pair, Karna and<br>Duryodhana, sat together on the same seat. And Sakuni, the king of<br>Gandhara, surrounded by the chiefs of his country, sat there, O king,<br>with his son beside him. And the high-souled Vidura sat on a begemmed<br>seat covered with a white deer-skin that almost touched Krishna's seat.<br>And all the kings in the assembly, although they gazed at Janardana of<br>Dasarha's race for a long while, were not, however, gratified with their<br>gaze, like drinkers of the Amrita, that are never satiated with quaffing<br>measure after measure. And Janardana attired in yellow robes having the<br>complexion of the Atasi flower, sat in the midst of that assembly like a<br>sapphire mounted on gold. And after Govinda had taken his seat, a perfect<br>silence ensued, for none present there spoke a single word.'"
