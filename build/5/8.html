                            "Vaisampayana said, 'O king, having learnt the news from the messengers,<br>Salya, accompanied by a large body of troops and by his sons, all of whom<br>were mighty in battle, was coming to the Pandavas. His encampment covered<br>an area of one and a half yojana, so large was the force owned by that<br>best of men. He was the master, O king, of an Akshauhini and had great<br>prowess and valour. And there were in his army heroes bearing armour of<br>various colours, with diverse kinds of banners and bows and ornaments and<br>cars and animals, all wearing excellent garlands, and various robes and<br>ornaments. And hundreds and thousands of foremost of Kshatriyas were the<br>leaders of his troops, dressed and decorated in the manner of their<br>native land. And he proceeded by slow marches, giving rest to his troops,<br>towards the place where the Pandava was. And the creatures of the earth<br>felt oppressed and the earth trembled under the tread of his troops. And<br>king Duryodhana, hearing that magnanimous and mighty hero was on his way,<br>hastened towards him and paid him honours, O best of the Bharata race and<br>caused finely decorated places of entertainment to be constructed at<br>different spots for his reception, on beautiful sites, and whither many<br>artists were directed to entertain the guests. And those pavilions<br>contained garlands and meat and the choicest viands and drinks, and wells<br>of various forms, capable of refreshing the heart, and tanks of various<br>forms, and edibles, and roomy apartments. And arriving at those<br>pavilions, and waited upon like a very god by the servants of Duryodhana<br>located at different spots, Salya reached another house of entertainment<br>resplendent as a retreat of the celestials. And there, greeted with<br>choice creature-comforts fit for beings superior to man, he deemed<br>himself superior even to the lord himself of the gods and thought meanly<br>of Indra as compared with himself. And that foremost of Kshatriyas,<br>well-pleased, asked the servants, saying, 'Where are those men of<br>Yudhishthira, who have prepared these places of refreshment? Let those<br>men who made these be brought to me. I deem them worthy of being rewarded<br>by me. I must reward them, let it so please the son of Kunti!' The<br>servants, surprised, submitted the whole matter to Duryodhana. And when<br>Salya was exceedingly pleased and ready to grant even his life,<br>Duryodhana, who had remained concealed, came forward and showed himself<br>to his maternal uncle. And the kind of the Madras saw him and understood<br>that it was Duryodhana who had taken all the trouble to receive him. And<br>Salya embraced Duryodhana and said, 'Accept something that you may<br>desire.'<br><br>"Duryodhana thereupon said, 'O thou auspicious one, let thy word be true,<br>grant me a boon. I ask thee to be the leader of all my army.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'And hearing this, Salya said, 'Be it so! What<br>else is to be done?' And the son of Gandhari repeated again and again,<br>'It is done.' And Salya said, 'O Duryodhana, O best of men, go to thy own<br>city. I shall proceed to pay a visit to Yudhishthira, the subduer of<br>foes. O king, I shall speedily come back, O ruler of men. That best of<br>men, Pandu's son Yudhishthira, must, by all means, be visited by me.' And<br>bearing this Duryodhana said, 'O king, O ruler of the earth, having seen<br>the Pandava, come speedily back. I depend entirely upon thee, O king of<br>kings. Remember the boon that thou hast granted me.' And Salya answered,<br>'Good betide thee! I shall come speedily back. Repair to thy own city, O<br>protector of men.' And then those two kings Salya and Duryodhana embraced<br>each other. And having thus greeted Salya, Duryodhana came back to his<br>own city. And Salya went to inform the sons of Kunti of that proceeding<br>of his. And having reached Upaplavya, and entered the encampment, Salya<br>saw there all the sons of Panda. And the mighty-armed Salya having met<br>the sons of Panda, accepted as usual water for washing his feet, and the<br>customary gifts of honour including a cow. And the king of the Madras,<br>that slayer of foes, first asked them how they were, and then with great<br>delight embraced Yudhishthira, and Bhima, and Arjuna, and the sons of his<br>sister the two twin-brothers. And when all had sat down, Salya spoke to<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, saying, 'O tiger among kings, O thou<br>delighter of the race of Kuru, is it all well with thee? O best of<br>victors, how fortunately hast thou spent the term of thy residence in the<br>wilderness, O king, O lord of monarchs, it was an exceedingly hard task<br>that thou hast performed by dwelling in the wilderness together with thy<br>brothers and this noble lady here. And awfully difficult task again was<br>that sojourn of thine,&#8212;the period of concealment,&#8212;which task also thou<br>hast performed, O descendant of Bharata; for one pulled down from a<br>throne it is nothing but hardship that awaits him. O king, where is there<br>any happiness for him! O afflicter of thy foes, in compensation for all<br>this vast misery wrought by Dhritarashtra's son, thou wilt attain to<br>proportional happiness after having killed thy foes, O great king, O lord<br>of men, the ways of the world are known to thee. Therefore, O my son,<br>thou art never guided by avarice in any of thy dealings. O descendant of<br>Bharata, do thou treat on the foot-prints of ancient saintly kings. My<br>son, Yudhishthira, be steady in the path of liberality, and<br>self-abnegation, and truth. And, O royal Yudhishthira, mercy and self<br>control, and truth and universal sympathy, and everything wonderful in<br>this world, are to be found in thee. Thou art mild, munificent,<br>religious, and liberal, and thou regardest virtue as the highest good. O<br>king, many are the rules of virtue that prevail amongst men, and all<br>those are known to thee. O my son, O afflicter of foes, thou knowest in<br>fact everything relating to this world. O king, O best of Bharata's race,<br>how lucky it is that thou hast come out of this difficulty of thine. How<br>lucky, O king, O foremost of monarchs, O lord, it is that I see thee, so<br>virtuous a soul, a treasure-house of righteousness, freed with thy<br>followers from this.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then, O descendant of Bharata, the king spoke<br>of his meeting with Duryodhana and gave a detailed account regarding that<br>promise of his and that boon granted by himself. And Yudhishthira said, O<br>valiant king, it has been well-done by thee that being pleased at heart<br>thou hast plighted thy truth to Duryodhana. But good betide thee, O ruler<br>of the earth, I ask thee to do one thing only. O king, O best of men,<br>thou wilt have to do it solely for my sake, though it may not be proper<br>to be done. O valiant one, hear what I submit to thee. O great king, thou<br>art equal to Krishna on the field of battle. When, O best of kings, the<br>single combat between Karna and Arjuna will take place, I have no doubt<br>thou wilt have to drive Karna's car. On that occasion, if thou art<br>inclined to do good to me, thou must protect Arjuna. O king, thou must<br>likewise so act that the Suta's son Karna may be dispirited and the<br>victory may be ours. Improper it no doubt is; but, O my uncle, for all<br>that thou must do it. Salya said, 'Good betide thee. Listen, O son of<br>Panda. Thou tellest me to so act that the vile son of the Suta may be<br>dispirited in fight. To be sure, I shall be his charioteer' on the field,<br>for he always considers me equal to Krishna. O tiger like descendant of<br>Kuru, I shall certainly speak to him, when desirous of fighting on the<br>field of battle, words contradictory and fraught with harm to him, so<br>that bereft of pride and valour, he may be easily slain by his<br>antagonist. This I tell thee truly. Asked by thee to do it, this I am<br>determined to do, O my son. Whatever else I may be able to bring about, I<br>shall do for thy good. Whatever troubles were suffered by thee together<br>with Draupadi on the occasion of the game at dice, the rude inhuman words<br>uttered by the Suta's son, the misery inflicted by the Asura Jata and by<br>Kichaka, O illustrious one, all the miseries experienced by Draupadi,<br>like those formerly experienced by Damayanti,&#8212;will all, O hero, end in<br>joy. Thou shouldst not be aggrieved at this; for Destiny is all powerful<br>in this world; and, O Yudhishthira, high-minded persons have to endure<br>miseries of various kinds, nay, even the gods themselves, O king, have<br>suffered misfortunes. O king, O descendant of Bharata, it is narrated<br>that the high-minded Indra, the chief of the celestials, had to endure<br>together with his wife very great misery, indeed.'
