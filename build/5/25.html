                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Here are met the Pandavas and the Srinjayas, and<br>Krishna, and Yuyudhana and Virata, O son of the Suta Gavalgana, tell us<br>all that Dhritarashtra hath directed thee to say.'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'I greet Yudhishthira, and Vrikodara and Dhananjaya, and<br>the two sons of Madri, and Vasudeva the descendant of Sura, and Satyaki,<br>and the aged ruler of the Panchalas, and Dhrishtadyumna, the son of<br>Prishata. Let all listen to the words I say from a desire for the welfare<br>of the Kurus. King Dhritarashtra, eagerly welcoming the chance of peace,<br>hastened the preparation of my car for this journey here. Let it be<br>acceptable to king Yudhishthira with his brothers and sons and relations.<br>Let the son of Pandu prefer peace. The sons of Pritha are endowed with<br>every virtue with steadiness and mildness and candour. Born in a high<br>family, they are humane, liberal, and loath to do any act which would<br>bring on shame. They know what is proper to be done. A base deed is not<br>befitting you, for you are so high-minded, and have such a terrible<br>following of troops. If you committed a sinful act, it would be a blot on<br>your fair name, as a drop of collyrium on a white cloth. Who could<br>knowingly be ever guilty of an act, which would result in universal<br>slaughter, which would be sinful and lead to hell,&#8212;an act consisting in<br>the destruction (of men), an act the result of which, whether it be<br>victory or defeat, is or the self-same value? Blessed are they that have<br>served their relative's cause. They are the true sons and friends and<br>relatives (of Kuru's race) who would lay down life, life which is liable<br>to be abused by misdeeds, in order to ensure the welfare of the Kurus. If<br>you, ye sons of Pritha, chastise the Kurus, by defeating and slaying all<br>your foes,&#8212;that subsequent life of yours would be equivalent to death,<br>for what, in sooth, is life after having killed all your kinsfolk? Who,<br>even if he were Indra himself with all the gods on his side, would be<br>able to defeat you who are aided by Kesava and Chekitanas, and Satyaki,<br>and are protected by Dhrishtadyumna's arms? Who again, O king, can defeat<br>in battle the Kurus who are protected by Drona and Bhishma, and<br>Aswatthaman, and Salya, and Kripa and Karna with a host of Kshatriya<br>kings? Who, without loss to himself, is able to slay the vast force<br>assembled by Dhritarashtra's son? Therefore it is, that I do not see any<br>good either in victory or in defeat. How can the sons of Pritha, like<br>base persons of low lineage, commit an act of unrighteousness? Therefore,<br>I appease, I prostrate myself before Krishna and the aged kin I g of the<br>Panchalas. I betake myself to you as my refuge, with joined hands, so<br>that both the Kurus and the Srinjayas may be benefited. It is not likely<br>that either Krishna or Dhananjaya will not act up to these my words.<br>Either of them would lay down his life, if besought (to do so).<br>Therefore, I say this for the success of my mission. This is the desire<br>of the king and his counsellor Bhishma, that there may be confirmed peace<br>between you (and the Kurus).'"
