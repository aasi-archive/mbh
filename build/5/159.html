                            "Vaisampayana said, 'About this time, there came into the Pandava camp<br>Bhishmaka's son, foremost among all persons of truthful resolution, and<br>known widely by the name of Rukmi. The high-souled Bhishmaka, who was<br>otherwise called king Hiranyaroman, was the friend of Indra. And he was<br>most illustrious among the descendants of Bhoja and was the ruler of the<br>whole southern country. And Rukmi was a disciple of that lion among the<br>Kimpurushas who was known by the name of Drona, having his abode on the<br>mountains of Gandhamadana. And he had learnt from his preceptor the whole<br>science of weapons with its four divisions. And that mighty-armed warrior<br>had obtained also the bow named Vijaya of celestial workmanship,<br>belonging to the great Indra, and which was equal to Gandiva in energy<br>and to also Sarnga (held by Krishna). There were three celestial bows<br>owned by the denizens of heaven, viz., Gandiva owned by Varuna, the bow<br>called Vijaya owned by Indra, and that other celestial bow of great<br>energy said to have been owned by Vishnu. This last (Sarnga), capable of<br>striking fear into the hearts of hostile warriors, was held by Krishna.<br>The bow called Gandiva was obtained by Indra's son (Arjuna) from Agni on<br>the occasion of the burning of Khandava, while the bow called Vijaya was<br>obtained from Drona by Rukmi of great energy. Baffling the nooses of Mura<br>and slaying by his might that Asura, and vanquishing Naraka, the son of<br>the Earth, Hrishikesa, while recovering the begemmed ear-rings (of<br>Aditi), with sixteen thousand girls and various kinds of jewels and gems,<br>obtained that excellent bow called Sarnga. And Rukmi having obtained the<br>bow called Vijaya whose twang resembled the roar of the clouds came to<br>the Pandavas, as if inspiring the whole universe with dread. Formerly,<br>proud of the might of his own arms, the heroic Rukmi could not tolerate<br>the ravishment of his sister Rukmini by wise Vasudeva. He had set out in<br>pursuit, having sworn that he would not return without having slain<br>Janardana. And accompanied by a large army consisting of four kinds of<br>forces that occupied (as it marched) a very large portion of the earth,<br>accoutred in handsome coats of mail and armed with diverse weapons and<br>resembling the swollen current of the Ganga, that foremost of all<br>wielders of weapons set out in pursuit of Vasudeva of Vrishni's race. And<br>having come up to him of Vrishni's race who was lord and master of<br>everything obtainable by ascetic austerities, Rukmi, O king, was<br>vanquished and covered with shame. And for this he returned not to (his<br>city) Kundina. And on the spot where that slayer of hostile heroes was<br>vanquished by Krishna, he built an excellent city named Bhojakata. And, O<br>king, that city filled with large forces and teeming with elephants,<br>steeds., is widely known on the earth by that name. Endued with great<br>energy, that hero, cased in mail and armed with bows, fences, swords and<br>quivers, quickly entered the Pandava camp, surrounded by an Akshauhini of<br>troops. And Rukmi entered that vast army, under a standard effulgent as<br>the sun, and made himself known to the Pandavas, from desire of doing<br>what was agreeable to Vasudeva. King Yudhishthira, advancing a few steps,<br>offered him worship. And duly worshipped and eulogised by the Pandavas,<br>Rukmi saluted them in return and rested for a while with his troops. And<br>addressing Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti in the midst of the heroes there<br>assembled, he said, 'If, O son of Pandu, thou art afraid, I am here to<br>render thee assistance in the battle. The assistance I will give thee<br>will be unbearable by thy foes. There is no man in this world who is<br>equal to me in prowess. I will slay those foes of thine whom thou, O son<br>of Pandu, wilt assign to me. I will slay one of those heroes, viz., Drona<br>and Kripa, and Bhishma, and Karna. Or, let all these kings of the earth<br>stand aside. Slaying in battle thy foes myself, I will give thee Earth.'<br>And he said this in the presence of king Yudhishthira the Just and of<br>Kesava and in the hearing of the (assembled) monarchs and all others (in<br>the camp). Then casting his eyes on Vasudeva and Pandu's son king<br>Yudhishthira the Just, Dhananjaya the intelligent son of Kunti smilingly<br>but in a friendly voice said these words, 'Born in the race of Kuru,<br>being especially the son of Pandu, naming Drona as my preceptor, having<br>Vasudeva for my ally, and bearing, besides the bow called Gandiva, how<br>can I say that I am afraid? O hero, when on the occasion of the tale 'of<br>cattle, I fought with the mighty Gandharvas, who was there to assist me?<br>In that terrific encounter also with the Gods and Danavas banded together<br>in great numbers at Khandava, who was my ally when I fought? When, again,<br>I fought with the Nivatakavachas and with those other Danavas called<br>Kalakeyas, who was my ally? When, again, at Virata's city I fought with<br>the numberless Kurus, who was my ally in that battle? Having paid my<br>respects, for battle's sake, to Rudra, Sakra, Vaisravana, Yama, Varuna,<br>Pavaka, Kripa, Drona, and Madhava, and wielding that tough celestial bow<br>of great energy called Gandiva, and accoutred with inexhaustible arrows<br>and armed with celestial weapons, how can a person like me, O tiger among<br>men, say, even unto Indra armed with the thunderbolt, such words as I am<br>afraid!&#8212;words that rob one of all his fame? O thou of mighty arms, I am<br>not afraid, nor have I any need of thy assistance. Go therefore, or stay,<br>as it pleaseth or suiteth thee.' Hearing these words of Arjuna, Rukmi<br>taking away with him his army vast as the sea, repaired then, O bull of<br>Bharata's race, to Duryodhana. And king Rukmi, repairing thither, said<br>the same words unto Duryodhana. But that king proud of his bravery,<br>rejected him in the same way.<br><br>'Thus, O king, two persons withdrew from the battle, viz., Rohini's son<br>(Rama) of Vrishni's race and king Rukmi. And after Rama had set out on<br>his pilgrimage to the tirthas, and Bhishmaka's son Rukmi had departed<br>thus, the sons of Pandu once more sat down for consulting with one<br>another. And that conclave presided over by king Yudhishthira the Just,<br>abounding with numerous monarchs, blazed forth like the firmament<br>bespangled with lesser luminaries with the moon in their midst.'"
