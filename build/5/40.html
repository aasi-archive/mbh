                            "Vidura said, 'Worshipped by the good and abandoning pride, that good man<br>who pursueth his objects without outstepping the limits of his power,<br>soon succeedeth in winning fame, for they that are good, when gratified<br>with a person, are certainly competent to bestow happiness on him. He<br>that forsaketh, of his own accord, even a great object owing to its being<br>fraught with unrighteousness, liveth happily, casting off all foes, like<br>a snake that hath cast off its slough. A victory gained by an untruth,<br>deceitful conduct towards the king, and insincerity of intentions<br>expressed before the preceptor,&#8212;these three are each equal to the sin of<br>slaying a Brahmana. Excessive envy, death, and boastfulness, are the<br>causes of the destruction of prosperity. Carelessness in waiting upon<br>preceptor, haste, and boastlessness, are the three enemies of knowledge.<br>Idleness, inattention, confusion of the intellect, restlessness,<br>gathering for killing time, haughtiness, pride, and covetous ness,&#8212;these<br>seven constitute, it is said, the faults of students in the pursuit of<br>learning. How can they that desire pleasure have knowledge? Students,<br>again, engaged in the pursuit of learning, cannot have pleasure. Votaries<br>of pleasure must give up knowledge, and votaries of knowledge must give<br>up pleasure. Fire is never gratified with fuel (but can consume any<br>measure thereof). The great ocean is never gratified with the rivers it<br>receives (but can receive any number of them). Death is never gratified<br>even with entire living creatures. A beautiful woman is never gratified<br>with any number of men (she may have). O king, hope killeth patience;<br>Yama killeth growth; anger killeth prosperity; miserliness killeth fame;<br>absence of tending killeth cattle; one angry Brahmana destroyeth a whole<br>kingdom. Let goats, brass, silver, honey, antidotes of poison, birds,<br>Brahmanas versed in the Vedas, old relatives, and men of high birth sunk<br>in poverty, be always present in thy house. O Bharata, Manu hath said<br>that goats, bulls, sandal, lyres, mirrors, honey, clarified butter, iron,<br>copper, conch-shells, salagram (the stony-image of Vishnu with gold<br>within) and gorochana should always be kept in one's house for the<br>worship of the gods. Brahmanas, and guests, for all those objects are<br>auspicious. O sire, I would impart to thee another sacred lesson<br>productive of great fruits, and which is the highest of all teachings,<br>viz., virtue should never be forsaken from desire, fear, or temptation,<br>nay, nor for the sake of life itself. Virtue is everlasting; pleasure and<br>pain are transitory; life is, indeed, everlasting but its particular<br>phases are transitory. Forsaking those which are transitory, betake<br>thyself to that which is everlasting, and let contentment be thine, for<br>contentment is the highest of all acquisitions. Behold, illustrious and<br>mighty kings, having ruled lands abounding with wealth and corn, have<br>become the victims of the Universal Destroyer, leaving behind their<br>kingdoms and vast sources of enjoyment. The son brought up with anxious<br>care, when dead, is taken up and carried away by men (to the burning<br>ground). With the dishevelled hair and crying piteously, they then cast<br>the body into the funeral pyre, as if it were a piece of wood. Others<br>enjoy the deceased's wealth, while birds and fire feast on the elements<br>of his body. With two only he goeth to the other world, viz., his merits<br>and his sins which keep him company. Throwing away the body, O sire,<br>relatives, friends, and sons retrace their steps, like birds abandoning<br>trees without blossoms and fruits. The person cast into the funeral pyre<br>is followed only by his own acts. Therefore, should men carefully and<br>gradually earn the merit of righteousness. In the world above this, and<br>also in that below this, there are regions of great gloom and darkness.<br>Know, O king, that those are regions where the senses of men are<br>exceedingly afflicted. Oh, let not any of those places to thine.<br>Carefully listening to these words, if thou canst act according to them,<br>thou wilt obtain great fame in this world of men, and fear will not be<br>thine here or hereafter. O Bharata, the soul is spoken of as a river;<br>religious merit constitutes its sacred baths; truth, its water;<br>self-control, its banks; kindness, its waves. He that is righteous<br>purifieth himself by a bath therein, for the soul is sacred, and the<br>absence of desire is the highest merit. O king, life is a river whose<br>waters are the five senses, and whose crocodiles and sharks are desire<br>and anger. Making self-control thy raft, cross thou its eddies which are<br>represented by repeated births! Worshipping and gratifying friends that<br>are eminent in wisdom, virtue, learning, and years, he that asketh their<br>advice about what he should do and should not do, is never misled. One<br>should restrain one's lust and stomach by patience; one's hands and feet<br>by one's eyes; one's eyes and ears by one's mind; and one's mind and<br>words by one's acts. That Brahmana who never omitteth to perform his<br>ablutions, who always weareth his sacred thread, who always attendeth to<br>the study of the Vedas, who always avoideth food that is unclean, who<br>telleth the truth and performeth acts in honour of his preceptor, never<br>falleth off from the region of Brahma. Having studied the Vedas, poured<br>libations into fire, performed sacrifices, protected subjects, sanctified<br>his soul by drawing weapons for protecting kine and Brahmanas, and died<br>on the field of battle, the Kshatriya attaineth to heaven. Having studied<br>the Vedas, and distributed in proper time, his wealth among Brahmanas,<br>Kshatriyas, and his own dependents, and inhaled the sanctified smoke of<br>the three kinds of fires, the Vaisya enjoyeth heavenly bliss in the other<br>world. Having properly worshipped Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaisayas in<br>due order, and having burnt his sins, by gratifying them, and then<br>peacefully casting off his body, the Sudra enjoyeth the bliss of heaven.<br>The duties of the four orders are thus set forth before thee. Listen now<br>to the reason of my speech as I discourse it. Yudhishthira, the son of<br>Pandu, is falling off from the duties of the Kshatriya order. Place him,<br>therefore, O king, in a position to discharge the duties of kings.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, It is even so as thou always teachest me. O amiable<br>one, my heart also inclineth that very way of which thou tellest me.<br>Although, however, I incline in my mind towards the Pandavas even as thou<br>teachest me to do, yet as soon as I come in contact with Duryodhana it<br>turneth off in a different way. No creature is able to avert fate.<br>Indeed, Destiny, I think, is certain to take its course; individual<br>exertion is futile.'"
