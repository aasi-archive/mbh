                            "Kunti said, 'In this connection, O chastiser of foes, is cited an old<br>story of the conversation between Vidula and her son. It behoveth thee to<br>say unto Yudhishthira anything that can be gathered from this or anything<br>more beneficial than that.<br><br>'There was a high-born dame of great foresight, named Vidula. She was<br>famous, slightly wrathful, of crooked disposition, and devoted to<br>Kshatriya virtues. Well-educated, she was known to all the kings of the<br>earth. Of great learning, she had listened to the speeches and<br>instructions of diverse mien. And the princess Vidula, one day, rebuked<br>her own son, who, after his defeat by the king of the Sindhus, lay<br>prostrate with heart depressed by despair. And she said, 'Thou art not my<br>son, O enhancer of the joys of foes. Begotten thou hast not been by<br>myself and thy father! Whence hast thou come? Without wrath as thou art,<br>thou canst not be counted as a man. Thy features betray thee to be a<br>eunuch. Sinkest thou in despair as long as thou livest? If thou art<br>desirous of thy own welfare, bear thou the burthen (of thy affairs on thy<br>shoulders), Do not disgrace thy soul. Do not suffer it to be gratified<br>with a little. Set thy heart on thy welfare, and be not afraid. Abandon<br>thy fears. Rise, O coward. Do not lie down thus, after thy defeat,<br>delighting all thy foes and grieving the friends, and reft of all sense<br>of honour. Little streams are filled up with only a quantity of water.<br>The palms of a mouse are filled with only a small quantity. A coward is<br>soon gratified, with acquisitions that are small. Rather perish in<br>plucking the fangs of a snake than die miserable like a dog. Put forth<br>thy prowess even at the risk of thy life. Like a hawk that fearlessly<br>rangeth the sky, do thou also wander fearlessly or put forth thy prowess,<br>or silently watch thy foes for an opportunity. Why dost thou lie down<br>like a carcass or like one smitten by thunder? Rise, O coward, do not<br>slumber after having been vanquished by the foe. Do not disappear from<br>the sight of all so miserably. Make thyself known by thy deeds. Never<br>occupy the intermediate, the low, or the lowest station. Blaze up (like a<br>well-fed fire). Like a brand of Tinduka wood, blaze up even for a moment,<br>but never smoulder from desire, like a flameless fire of paddy chaff. It<br>is better to blaze up for a moment than smoke for ever and ever. Let no<br>son be born in a royal race, who is either exceedingly fierce or<br>exceedingly mild. Repairing to the field of battle and achieving every<br>great feat that is possible for man to achieve, a brave man is freed from<br>the debt he oweth to the duties of the Kshatriya order. Such a person<br>never disgraceth his own self. Whether he gaineth his object or not, he<br>that is possessed of sense never indulgeth in grief. On the other hand,<br>such a person accomplisheth what should be next done, without caring for<br>even his life. Therefore, O son, display thy prowess, or obtain that end<br>which is inevitable. Why, Indeed, dost thou live, disregarding the duties<br>of thy order? All thy religious rites, O eunuch, and all thy achievements<br>are gone. The every root of all thy enjoyments is cut off. What for then<br>dost thou live? If fall and sink one must, he should seize the foe by the<br>hips (and thus fall with the foe). Even if one's roots are cut off, he<br>should not yet give way to despair. Horse of high mettle put forth all<br>their prowess for dragging or bearing heavy weights. Remembering their<br>behaviour, muster, all thy strength and sense of honour. Know also in<br>what thy manliness consists. Exert thyself in raising that race which<br>hath sunk, in consequence of thee. He that hath not achieved a great feat<br>forming the subject of men's conversation, only increaseth the number of<br>population. He is neither man nor woman. He whose fame is not founded in<br>respect of charity, asceticism, truth, learning and acquisition of<br>wealth, is only his mother's excreta. On the other hand, he that<br>surpasseth others in learning, asceticism, wealth, prowess, and deeds, is<br>(truly) a man. It behoveth thee not to adopt the idle, wretched,<br>infamous, and miserable profession of mendicancy that is worthy only of a<br>coward. Friends never derive any happiness on obtaining that weak person<br>for a friend, at whose sight foes are delighted, who is despised by men,<br>who is without seats and robes, who is gratified with small acquisitions,<br>who is destitute, and who hath no courage, and is low. Alas, exiled from<br>our kingdom, driven from home, deprived of all means of enjoyment and<br>pleasure, and destitute, of resources, we shall have to perish from want<br>of the very means of life! Misbehaving in the midst of those that are<br>good, and the destroyer of thy race and family, by bringing thee forth, O<br>Sanjaya, I have brought forth Kali himself in the shape of a son. Oh, let<br>no woman bring forth such a son (as thou) that art without wrath, without<br>exertion, without energy, and that art the joy of foes. Do not smoulder.<br>Blaze thou up, effectively displaying thy prowess. Slay thy foes. For but<br>a moment, for ever so small a space of time, blaze thou up on the heads<br>of thy enemies. He is a man who cherisheth wrath and forgiveth not. He,<br>on the other hand, who is forgiving and without wrath, is neither a man<br>nor woman. Contentment and softness of heart and these two, viz., want of<br>exertion and fear, are destructive of prosperity. He that is without<br>exertion never winneth what is great. Therefore, O son, free thyself, by<br>thy own exertions, from these faults that lead to defeat and downfall.<br>Steel thy heart and seek to recover thy own. A man is called Purusha<br>because he is competent to trouble his foe (param). He, therefore, who<br>liveth like a woman is misnamed Purusha (man). A brave king of mighty<br>strength, and who moveth like a lion, may go the way of all creatures.<br>The subjects, however, that reside in his dominions do not yet become<br>unhappy. That king, who, disregarding his own happiness and pleasures,<br>seeketh the prosperity of his kingdom, succeedeth soon in gladdening his<br>counsellors and friends.'<br><br>"Hearing these words, the son said, 'If thou dost not behold me, of what<br>use would the whole earth be to thee, of what use thy ornaments, of what<br>use all the means of pleasure and even life itself?' The mother said,<br>'Let those regions be obtained by our foes which belong to those that are<br>low. Let those again that are friends go to those regions which are<br>obtainable by persons whose souls are held in respect. Do not adopt the<br>course of life that is followed by those wretched persons, who, destitute<br>of strength, and without servants and attendants (to do their bidding)<br>live upon the food supplied by others. Like the creatures of the earth<br>that depend on the clouds, or the gods depending on Indra, let the<br>Brahmanas and thy friends all depend on thee for their sustenance. His<br>life, O Sanjaya, is not vain on whom all creatures depend for their<br>sustenance, like birds repairing to a tree abounding with ripe fruits.<br>The life of that brave man is, indeed, praiseworthy, through whose<br>prowess friends derive happiness, like the gods deriving happiness<br>through the prowess of Sakra. That man who liveth in greatness depending<br>on the prowess of his own arms, succeedeth in winning fame in this world<br>and blessed state in the next!'"
