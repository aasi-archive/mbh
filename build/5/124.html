                            "Dhritarashtra said, 'O holy one, it is even so as thou, O Narada,<br>sayest. My wish also is precisely such, but, O holy one, I have no power<br>(to carry them out)!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'The Kuru king, having said these words unto<br>Narada, then addressed Krishna and said, 'Thou hast, O Kesava, told me<br>that which leadeth to heaven, what is beneficial to the world, consistent<br>with virtue, and fraught with reason. I am not, however, O sire,<br>independent. Duryodhana never doth what is agreeable to me. Do thou,<br>therefore, O mighty-armed Krishna, O best of persons, strive to persuade<br>that foolish and wicked son of mine, who disobeyeth my commands. O<br>mighty-armed one, he never listeneth to the beneficial words, O<br>Hrishikesa, of Gandhari, or of wise Vidura, or of other friends headed by<br>Bhishma, all of whom seek his good. Do thou, therefore, thyself counsel<br>that crooked, senseless, and wicked-souled prince, of evil disposition<br>and sinful heart. By doing this, O Janardana, thou shalt have done that<br>noble act which a friend should ever do.' Thus addressed, he of Vrishni's<br>race, conversant with the truths of virtue and profit, approached nearer<br>to the ever-wrathful Duryodhana and said unto him these sweet words, 'O<br>Duryodhana, O best of the Kurus, listen to these words of mine, uttered<br>especially for thy good, as also, O Bharata, for that of thy followers,<br>Thou art born in a race that is distinguished for its great wisdom. It<br>behoveth thee to act righteously as I indicate. Possessed of learning and<br>endued with excellent behaviour, thou art adorned with every excellent<br>quality. They that are born in ignoble families, or are wicked-souled,<br>cruel, and shameless, they only, O sire, act in the way that seemeth<br>acceptable to thee. In this world, the inclinations of those only that<br>are righteous seem to be consistent with the dictates of virtue and<br>profit. The inclinations, however, of those that are unrighteous seem to<br>be perverse. O bull of Bharata's race, the disposition that thou art<br>repeatedly manifesting is of that perverse kind. Persistence in such<br>behaviour is sinful, frightful, highly wicked, and capable of leading to<br>death itself. It is besides, causeless, while, again, thou canst not, O<br>Bharata, adhere to it long. If by avoiding this which is productive only<br>of woe, thou wilt achieve thy own good, if, O chastiser of foes, thou<br>wilt escape from the sinful and disreputable deeds of thy brothers,<br>followers, and counsellors, then, O tiger among men, make peace, O bull<br>among the Bharatas, with the sons of Pandu who are all endued with great<br>wisdom and great bravery with great exertion and great learning an all of<br>whom have their souls under complete control. Such conduct will be<br>agreeable to and conducive to the happiness of Dhritarashtra who is<br>endued with great wisdom, of grandsire (Bhishma), Drona, the high-souled<br>Kripa, Somadatta, wise Vahlika, Aswatthaman, Vikarna, Sanjaya,<br>Vivingsati, and of many of thy kinsmen, O chastiser of foes, and many of<br>thy friends also. The whole world, O sire, will derive benefit from that<br>peace. Thou art endued with modesty, born in a noble race, hast learning<br>and kindness of heart. Be obedient, O sire, to the commands of thy<br>father, and also of thy mother, O bull of Bharata's race. They that are<br>good sons always regard that to be beneficial which their fathers<br>command. Indeed, when overtaken by calamity, every one recollects the<br>injunctions of his father. Peace with the Pandavas, O sire, recommend<br>itself to thy father. Let it, therefore, O chief of the Kurus recommend<br>itself to thee also with thy counsellors. That mortal who having listened<br>to the counsels of friends doth not act according to them, is consumed at<br>the end by the consequences of his disregard, like him who swalloweth the<br>fruit called Kimpaka. He that from folly doth not accept beneficial<br>counsels, unnerved by procrastination and unable to attain his object, is<br>obliged to repent at last. He, on the other hand, who having listened to<br>beneficial counsels accepteth them at once, abandoning his opinion,<br>always winneth happiness in the world. He that rejects the words of<br>well-meaning friends, regarding those words as opposed to his interest,<br>but accepts words that are really so opposed, is soon subjugated by his<br>foes. Disregarding the opinions of the righteous he that abideth by the<br>opinions of the wicked, soon maketh his friends weep for him in<br>consequence of his being plunged into distress. Forsaking superior<br>counsellors he that seeketh the advice of inferior ones, soon falleth<br>into great distress and succeedeth not in saving himself. That companion<br>of the sinful, who behaveth falsely and never listeneth to good friends,<br>who honoureth strangers but hateth those that are his own, is soon, O<br>Bharata, cast off by the Earth. O bull of Bharata's race, having<br>quarrelled with those (the sons of Pandu), thou seekest protection from<br>others viz., those that are sinful, incapable, and foolish. What other<br>man is there on earth besides thee, who, disregarding kinsmen, that are<br>all mighty charioteers, and each of whom resembleth Sakra himself, would<br>seek protection and aid from strangers? Thou hast persecuted the sons of<br>Kunti, from their very birth. They have not been angry with thee, for the<br>sons of Pandu are indeed virtuous. Although thou hast behaved deceitfully<br>towards the Pandavas from their very birth, yet, O mighty-armed one,<br>those distinguished persons have acted generously towards thee. It<br>behoveth thee, therefore, O bull of Bharata's race, to act towards those<br>principal kinsmen of thine with equal generosity. Do not yield thyself to<br>the influence of wrath. O bull of Bharata's race, the exertions of the<br>wise are always associated with virtue, profit, and desire. If, indeed,<br>all these three cannot be attained, men follow at least virtue and<br>profit. If, again, these three are pursued separately, it is seen that<br>they that have their hearts under control, choose virtue; they that are<br>neither good nor bad but occupy a middle station, choose profit, which is<br>always the subject of dispute; while they that are fools choose the<br>gratification of desire. The fool that from temptation giveth up virtue<br>and pursueth profit and desire by unrighteous means, is soon destroyed by<br>his senses. He that speaketh profit and desire, should yet practise<br>virtue at the outset, for neither profit nor desire is (really)<br>dissociated from virtue. O king, it hath been said that virtue alone is<br>the cause of the three, for he that seeketh the three, may, by the aid of<br>virtue alone, grow like fire when brought into contact with a heap of dry<br>grass. O bull of Bharata's race, thou seeketh, O sire, by unrighteous<br>means this extensive empire, flourishing with prosperity and well-known<br>to all the monarchs of the earth. O king, he that behaveth falsely<br>towards those that live and conduct themselves righteously, certainly<br>cutteth down his own self, like a forest with an axe. One must not seek<br>to confound his understanding whose overthrow one doth not like, for, if<br>one's understanding is confounded, one can never devote his attention to<br>what is beneficial. One that hath his soul under control never, O<br>Bharata, disregardeth anybody in the three worlds,&#8212;no, not even the<br>commonest creature, far less those bulls among men, the sons of Pandu. He<br>that surrendereth himself to the influence of anger loseth his sense of<br>right and wrong. Rank growth must always be cut off. Behold, O Bharata,<br>this is the proof. At present, O sire, union with the sons of Pandu is<br>better for thee than thy union with the wicked. If thou makest peace with<br>them, thou mayst obtain the fruition of all thy wishes. O best of kings,<br>while enjoying the kingdom that has been founded by the Pandavas, thou<br>seekest protection from others, disregarding the Pandavas themselves.<br>Reposing the cares of thy state on Dussasana, Durvisaha, Karna, and<br>Suvala's son, thou desirest the continuance of thy prosperity, O Bharata.<br>These, however, are far inferior to the Pandavas in knowledge, in virtue,<br>in capacity for acquiring wealth, and in prowess. Indeed, O Bharata, (let<br>alone the four I have mentioned) all these kings together, with thee at<br>their head, are incapable of even looking at the face of Bhima, when<br>angry, on the field of battle. O sire, this force consisting of all the<br>kings of the earth is, indeed, at thy elbow. There are also Bhishma, and<br>Drona, and this Karna, and Kripa, and Bhurisrava, and Somadatta, and<br>Aswatthaman, and Jayadratha. All these together are incapable of fighting<br>against Dhananjaya. Indeed, Arjuna is incapable of being vanquished in<br>battle even by all the gods, Asuras, men, and Gandharvas. Do not set thy<br>heart for battle. Seest thou the man in any of the royal races of the<br>earth, who having encountered Arjuna in battle can return home safe and<br>sound? O bull of Bharata's race, what advantage is there in a universal<br>slaughter? Show me a single man who will defeat that Arjuna, by defeating<br>whom alone victory may be thine? Who will encounter that son of Pandu in<br>battle, who had vanquished all the celestials with the Gandharvas,<br>Yakshas and Pannagas at Khandavaprastha? Then also the marvellous account<br>that is heard of what happened at Virata's city, touching that encounter<br>between one and many, is sufficient proof of this, Hopest thou to<br>vanquish in battle Arjuna who when excited with rage is invincible,<br>irresistible, ever-victorious, and undeteriorating Arjuna, that hero, who<br>gratified the God of gods, Siva himself in fight? With myself again as<br>his second when that son of Pritha will rush to the field of battle<br>against an enemy, who is there that is competent to challenge him then?<br>Can Purandara himself do so? He that would vanquish Arjuna in battle<br>would support the Earth on his arms, consume in rage the whole population<br>of the Earth, and hurl the very gods from heaven. Look at thy sons, thy<br>brothers, kinsmen, and other relatives. Let not these chiefs of Bharata's<br>race all perish on thy account. Let not the race of Kauravas be<br>exterminated or reduced. O king, let not people say that thou art the<br>exterminator of thy race and the destroyer of its achievements. Those<br>mighty car-warriors, the Pandavas (if peace be made) will install thee as<br>the Yuvaraja, and thy father Dhritarashtra, that lord of men, as the<br>sovereign of this extensive empire. Do not, O sire, disregard the<br>prosperity that is awaiting thee and is sure to come. Giving to the sons<br>of Pritha half the kingdom, win thou great prosperity. Making peace with<br>the Pandavas and acting according to the counsels of thy friends, and<br>rejoicing with them, thou art sure to obtain what is for thy good for<br>ever and ever.'"
