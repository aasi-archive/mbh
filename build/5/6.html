                            "Drupada said, 'Of beings those that are endowed with life are superior.<br>Of living beings those that are endowed with intelligence are superior.<br>Of intelligent creatures men are superior. Of men the twice-born are<br>superior. Of the twice-born, students of the Veda are superior. Of<br>students of the Veda those of cultured understanding are superior. Of<br>cultured men practical persons are superior. And finally, of practical<br>men those knowing the Supreme Being are superior. You, it seems to me,<br>are at the very top of those that are of cultured understanding. You are<br>distinguished both for age and learning. You are equal in intellect to<br>either Sukra or Vrihaspati, the son of Angiras. You know what kind of man<br>the chief of the Kuru race is, and what kind of man also is Yudhishthira,<br>the son of Kunti. It was with Dhritarashtra's knowledge that the Pandavas<br>were-deceived by their opponents. Though instructed by Vidura he yet<br>follows his son! Sakuni advisedly challenged Yudhishthira to a gambling<br>match although the latter was unskilled in gambling while the former was<br>an adept in it. Unskilled in play, Yudhishthira was guileless and firm in<br>following the rules of the military order. Having thus cheated the<br>virtuous king Yudhishthira, they will, by no means, voluntarily yield up<br>the kingdom. If you speak words of righteousness unto Dhritarashtra, you<br>will certainly gain the hearts of his fighting men. Vidura also will make<br>use of those words of yours and will thus alienate the hearts of Bhishma,<br>and Drona, and Kripa, and others. When the officers of state are<br>alienated and fighting men are backward, the task of the enemy will be to<br>gain back their hearts. In the meantime, the Pandavas will, with ease and<br>with their whole hearts, address themselves in preparing the army and in<br>collecting stores. And when the enemy's adherents are estranged, and<br>while you are hanging about them, they will surely not be able to make<br>adequate preparations for war. This course seems expedient in this wise.<br>On your meeting with Dhritarashtra it is possible that Dhritarashtra may<br>do what you say. And as you are virtuous, you must therefore act<br>virtuously towards them. And to the compassionate, you must descant upon<br>the various hardships that the Pandavas have endured. And you must<br>estrange the hearts of the aged persons by discoursing upon the family<br>usages which were followed by their forefathers. I do not entertain the<br>slightest doubt in this matter. Nor need you be apprehensive of any<br>danger from them, for you are a Brahmana, versed in the Vedas; and you<br>are going thither as an ambassador, and more specially, you are an aged<br>man. Therefore, I ask you to set out without delay towards the Kauravas<br>with the object of promoting the interests of the Pandavas, timing your<br>departure under the (astrological) combination called Pushya and at that<br>part of the day called Jaya.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus instructed by the magnanimous Drupada, the<br>virtuous priest set out for Hastinapura (the city called after the<br>elephant). And that learned man, well-versed in the principles of the<br>science of politics, started with a following of disciples towards the<br>Kurus for the sake of promoting the welfare of Pandu's sons.'
