                            "Vaisampayana said,&#8212;Then the king Yudhishthira hastily ran after<br>Sisupala and spoke unto him sweetly and in a conciliating tone the<br>following words,&#8212;'O lord of earth, what thou hast said is scarcely<br>proper for thee. O king, it is highly sinful and needlessly cruel. Insult<br>not Bhishma, O king, by saying that he doth not know what virtue is.<br>Behold, these many kings, older than thou art, all approve of the worship<br>offered unto Krishna. It behoveth thee to bear it patiently like them. O<br>ruler of Chedi, Bhishma knoweth Krishna truly. Thou knowest him not so<br>well as this one of the Kuru race.'"<br><br>"Bhishma also, after this, said,&#8212;He that approveth not the worship<br>offered unto Krishna, the oldest one in the universe, deserveth neither<br>soft words nor conciliation. The chief of warriors of the Kshatriya rare<br>who having overcome a Kshatriya in battle and brought him under his<br>power, setteth him free, becometh the guru (preceptor or master) of the<br>vanquished one. I do not behold in this assembly of kings even one ruler<br>of men who hath not been vanquished in battle by the energy of this son<br>of the Satwata race. This one (meaning Krishna) here, of undefiled glory,<br>deserveth to be worshipped not by ourselves alone, but being of mighty<br>arms, he deserveth to be worshipped by the three worlds also. Innumerable<br>warriors among Kshatriyas have been vanquished in battle by Krishna. The<br>whole universe without limit is established in him of the Vrishni race.<br>Therefore do we worship Krishna amongst the best and the oldest, and not<br>others. It behoveth thee not to say so. Let thy understanding be never<br>so. I have, O king, waited upon many persons that are old in knowledge. I<br>have heard from all those wise men, while talking; of the numerous<br>much-regarded attributes of the accomplished Sauri. I have also heard<br>many times all the acts recited by people that Krishna of great<br>intelligence hath performed since his birth. And, O king of Chedi, we do<br>not from caprice, or keeping in view our relationship or the benefits he<br>may confer on us, worship Janarddana who is worshipped by the good on<br>earth and who is the source of the happiness of every creature. We have<br>offered unto him the first worship because of his fame, his heroism, his<br>success. There is none here of even tender years whom we have not taken<br>into consideration. Passing over many persons that are foremost for their<br>virtues, we have regarded Hari as deserving of the first worship. Amongst<br>the Brahmanas one that is superior in knowledge, amongst the Kshatriyas<br>one that is superior in strength, amongst the Vaisyas one that is<br>superior in possessions and wealth, and amongst the Sudras one that is<br>superior in years, deserveth to be worshipped. In the matter of the<br>worship offered unto Govinda, there are two reason, viz., knowledge of<br>the Vedas and their branches, and also excess of strength. Who else is<br>there in the world of men save Kesava that is so distinguished? Indeed,<br>liberality, cleverness, knowledge of the Vedas, bravery, modesty,<br>achievements, excellent intelligence, humility, beauty, firmness,<br>contentment and prosperity&#8212;all dwell for ever in Achyuta. Therefore, ye<br>kings; it behoveth ye to approve of the worship that hath been offered<br>unto Krishna who is of great accomplishments, who as the preceptor, the<br>father, the guru, is worthy of the Arghya and deserving of (everybody's)<br>worship. Hrishikesa is the sacrificial priest, the guru, worthy of being<br>solicited to accept one's daughter in marriage, the Snataka, the king,<br>the friend: therefore hath Achyuta been worshipped by us. Krishna is the<br>origin of the universe and that in which the universe is to dissolve.<br>Indeed, this universe of mobile and immobile creatures hath sprung into<br>existence from Krishna only. He is the unmanifest primal cause (Avyakta<br>Prakriti), the creator, the eternal, and beyond the ken of all creatures.<br>Therefore doth he of unfading glory deserve highest worship. The<br>intellect, the seat of sensibility, the five elements, air, heat, water,<br>ether, earth, and the four species of beings (oviparous, viviparous, born<br>of filthy damp and vegetal) are all established in Krishna. The sun, the<br>moon, the constellations, the planets, all the principal directions, the<br>intermediate directions, are all established in Krishna. As the Agnihotra<br>is the foremost among all Vedic sacrifices, as the Gayatri is the<br>foremost among metres, as the king is the foremost among men, as the<br>ocean is the foremost among all rivers, as the moon is the foremost among<br>all constellations, as the sun is the foremost among all luminous bodies,<br>as the Meru is the foremost among all mountains, as Garuda is the<br>foremost among all birds, so as long as the upward, downward, and sideway<br>course of the universe lasteth, Kesava is the foremost in all the worlds<br>including the regions of the celestials. This Sisupala is a mere boy and<br>hence he knoweth not Krishna, and ever and everywhere speaketh of Krishna<br>thus. This ruler of Chedi will never see virtue in that light in which<br>one that is desirous of acquiring high merit will see it. Who is there<br>among the old and the young or among these illustrious lords of earth<br>that doth not regard Krishna as deserving of worship or that doth not<br>worship Krishna? If Sisupala regardeth this worship as undeserved, it<br>behoveth him to do what is proper in this matter.'"
