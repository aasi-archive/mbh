                            "Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Then that chief of men, king Yudhishthira, entered<br>that palatial sabha having first fed ten thousand Brahmanas with<br>preparations of milk and rice mixed with clarified butter and honey with<br>fruits and roots, and with pork and venison. The king gratified those<br>superior Brahmanas, who had come from various countries with food<br>seasoned with seasamum and prepared with vegetables called jibanti, with<br>rice mixed with clarified butter, with different preparations of<br>meat&#8212;with indeed various kinds of other food, as also numberless viands<br>that are fit to be sucked and innumerable kinds of drinks, with new and<br>unused robes and clothes, and with excellent floral wreaths. The king<br>also gave unto each of those Brahmanas a thousand kine. And, O Bharata,<br>the voice of the gratified Brahmanas uttering,&#8212;'What an auspicious day<br>is this! became so loud that it seemed to reach heaven itself. And when<br>the Kuru king entered the palatial sabha having also worshipped the gods<br>with various kinds of music and numerous species of excellent and costly<br>perfumes, the athletes and mimes and prize-fighters and bards and<br>encomiasts began to gratify that illustrious son of Dharma by exhibiting<br>their skill. And thus celebrating his entry into the palace, Yudhishthira<br>with his brothers sported within that palace like Sakra himself in<br>heaven. Upon the seats in that palace sat, along with the Pandavas,<br>Rishis and kings that came from various countries, viz., Asita and<br>Devala, Satya, Sarpamali and Mahasira; Arvavasu, Sumitra, Maitreya,<br>Sunaka and Vali; Vaka, Dalvya, Sthulasira, Krishna-Dwaipayana, and Suka<br>Sumanta, Jaimini, Paila, and the disciples of Vyasa, viz., ourselves;<br>Tittiri, Yajanavalkya, and Lomaharshana with his son; Apsuhomya, Dhaumya,<br>Animandavya; and Kausika; Damoshnisha and Traivali, Parnada, and<br>Varayanuka, Maunjayana, Vayubhaksha, Parasarya, and Sarika; Valivaka,<br>Silivaka, Satyapala, and Krita-srama; Jatukarna, and Sikhavat. Alamva and<br>Parijataka; the exalted Parvata, and the great Muni Markandeya;<br>Pavitrapani, Savarna, Bhaluki, and Galava. Janghabandhu, Raibhya,<br>Kopavega, and Bhrigu: Harivabhru, Kaundinya, Vabhrumali, and Sanatana,<br>Kakshivat, and Ashija, Nachiketa, and Aushija, Nachiketa, and Gautama;<br>Painga, Varaha, Sunaka, and Sandilya of great ascetic merit: Kukkura,<br>Venujangha, Kalapa and Katha;&#8212;these virtuous and learned Munis with<br>senses and souls under complete control, and many others as numerous, all<br>well-skilled in the Vedas and Vedangas and conversant with (rules of)<br>morality and pure and spotless in behaviour, waited on the illustrious<br>Yudhishthira, and gladdened him by their sacred discourses. And so also<br>numerous principal Kshatriyas, such as the illustrious and virtuous<br>Mujaketu, Vivarddhana, Sangramjit, Durmukha, the powerful Ugrasena;<br>Kakshasena, the lord of the Earth, Kshemaka the invincible; Kamatha, the<br>king of Kamvoja, and the mighty Kampana who alone made the Yavanas to<br>ever tremble at his name just as the god that wieldeth the thunder-bolt<br>maketh those Asuras, the Kalakeyas, tremble before him; Jatasura, and the<br>king of the Madrakas, Kunti, Pulinda the king of the Kiratas, and the<br>kings of Anga and Vanga, and Pandrya, and the king of Udhara, and<br>Andhaka; Sumitra, and Saivya that slayer of foes; Sumanas, the king of<br>the Kiratas, and Chanur the King of the Yavanas, Devarata, Bhoja, and the<br>so called Bhimaratha, Srutayudha&#8212;the king of Kalinga, Jayasena the king<br>of Magadha; and Sukarman, and Chekitana, and Puru that slayer of foes;<br>Ketumata, Vasudana, and Vaideha and Kritakshana: Sudharman, Aniruddha,<br>Srutayu endued with great strength; the invincible Anuparaja, the<br>handsome Karmajit; Sisupala with his son, the king of Karusha; and the<br>invincible youths of the Vrishni race, all equal in beauty unto the<br>celestials, viz., Ahuka, Viprithu, Sada, Sarana, Akrura, Kritavarman, and<br>Satyaka, the son of Sini; and Bhismaka, Ankriti, and the powerful<br>Dyumatsena, those chief of bowmen viz., the Kaikeyas and Yajnasena of the<br>Somaka race; these Kshatriyas endured with great might, all well-armed<br>and wealthy, and many others also regarded as the foremost, all waited<br>upon Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, in that Sabha, desirous of<br>ministering to his happiness. And those princes also, endued with great<br>strength, who dressing themselves in deer-skins learnt the science of<br>weapons under Arjuna, waited upon Yudhishthira. And O king, the princes<br>also of the Vrishni race, viz., Pradyumna (the son of Rukmini) and Samva,<br>and Yuyudhana the son of Satyaki and Sudharman and Aniruddha and Saivya<br>that foremost of men who had learnt the science of arms under Arjuna<br>these and many other kings, O lord of the Earth, used to wait on<br>Yudhishthira on that occasion. And that friend of Dhananjaya, Tumvuru,<br>and the Gandharva Chittasena with his ministers, any many other<br>Gandharvas and Apsaras, well-skilled in vocal and instrumental music and<br>in cadence and Kinnaras also well-versed in (musical) measures and<br>motions singing celestial tunes in proper and charming voices, waited<br>upon and gladdened the sons of Pandu and the Rishis who sat in that<br>Sabha. And seated in that Sabha, those bull among men, of rigid vows and<br>devoted to truth, all waited upon Yudhishthira like the celestials in<br>heaven waiting upon Brahma."
