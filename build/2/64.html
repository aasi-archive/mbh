                            "Sakuni said,&#8212;'Thou hast, O Yudhishthira, lost much wealth of the<br>Pandavas. If thou hast still anything that thou hast not yet lost to us,<br>O son of Kunti, tell us what it is!"<br><br>"Yudhishthira said,&#8212;O son of Suvala, I know that I have untold wealth.<br>But why is it, O Sakuni, that thou askest me of my wealth? Let tens of<br>thousands and millions and millions and tens of millions and hundreds of<br>millions and tens of billions and hundreds of billions and trillions and<br>tens of trillions and hundreds of trillions and tens of quadrillions and<br>hundreds of quadrillions and even more wealth be staked by thee. I have<br>as much. With that wealth, O king, I will play with thee."<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Hearing this, Sakuni, ready with the dice, adopting<br>unfair means, said unto Yudhishthira, 'Lo, I have won!'<br><br>'Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'I have, O son of Suvala, immeasurable kine and<br>horses and milch cows with calves and goats and sheep in the country<br>extending from the Parnasa to the eastern bank of the Sindu. With this<br>wealth, O king, I will play with thee.<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Hearing this Sakuni, ready with the dice, adopting<br>unfair means, said unto Yudhishthira, 'Lo, I have won!'<br><br>Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'I have my city, the country, land, the wealth of all<br>dwelling therein except of the Brahmanas, and all those persons<br>themselves except Brahmanas still remaining to me. With this wealth, O<br>king, I will play with thee.'<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Hearing this, Sakuni, ready with the dice, adopting<br>foul means, said unto Yudhishthira, 'Lo! I have won.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said,&#8212;These princes here, O king, who look resplendent in<br>their ornaments and their ear-rings and Nishkas and all the royal<br>ornaments on their persons are now my wealth. With this wealth, O king, I<br>play with thee.<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Hearing this, Sakuni, ready with his dice, adopting<br>foul means, said unto Yudhishthira, 'Lo! I have won them.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'This Nakula here, of mighty arms and leonine neck,<br>of red eyes and endued with youth, is now my one stake. Know that he is<br>my wealth.'<br><br>Sakuni said,&#8212;'O king Yudhishthira, prince Nakula is dear to thee. He is<br>already under our subjection. With whom (as stake) wilt thou now play?"<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Saying this, Sakuni cast those dice, and said unto<br>Yudhishthira, 'Lo! He hath been won by us.'<br><br>Yudhishthira said,&#8212;"This Sahadeva administereth justice. He hath also<br>acquired a reputation for learning in this world. However undeserving he<br>may be to be staked in play, with him as stake I will play, with such a<br>dear object as it, indeed, he were not so!"<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Hearing this, Sakuni, ready with the dice, adopting<br>foul means, said unto Yudhishthira, 'Lo! I have won.'<br><br>"Sakuni continued,&#8212;'O king, the sons of Madri, dear unto thee, have both<br>been won by me. It would seem, however, that Bhimasena and Dhananjaya are<br>regarded very much by thee.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'Wretch! thou actest sinfully in thus seeking to<br>create disunion amongst us who are all of one heart, disregarding<br>morality.'<br><br>"Sakuni said,&#8212;'One that is intoxicated falleth into a pit (hell) and<br>stayeth there deprived of the power of motion. Thou art, O king, senior<br>to us in age, and possessed of the highest accomplishments. O bull of the<br>Bharata race, I (beg my pardon and) bow to thee. Thou knowest, O<br>Yudhishthira, that gamesters, while excited with play, utter such ravings<br>that they never indulge in the like of them in their waking moments nor<br>even in dream.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said,&#8212;He that taketh us like a boat to the other shore of<br>the sea of battle, he that is ever victorious over foes, the prince who<br>is endued with great activity, he who is the one hero in this world, (is<br>here). With that Falguna as stake, however, undeserving of being made so,<br>I will now play with thee.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Hearing this, Sakuni, ready with the dice, adopting<br>foul means, said unto Yudhishthira, 'Lo! I have won.'<br><br>"Sakuni continued,&#8212;'This foremost of all wielders of the bow, this son<br>of Pandu capable of using both his hands with equal activity hath now<br>been won by me. O play now with the wealth that is still left unto thee,<br>even with Bhima thy dear brother, as thy stake, O son of Pandu.<br><br>"Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'O king, however, undeserving he may be of being<br>made a stake, I will now play with thee by staking Bhimasena, that prince<br>who is our leader, who is the foremost in fight,&#8212;even like the wielder<br>of the thunder-bolt&#8212;the one enemy of the Danavas,&#8212;the high-souled one<br>with leonine neck and arched eye-brows and eyes looking askance, who is<br>incapable of putting up with an insult, who hath no equal in might in the<br>world, who is the foremost of all wielders of the mace, and who grindeth<br>all foes,'"<br><br>"Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Hearing this, Sakuni, ready with the dice adopting<br>foul means, said unto Yudhishthira. 'Lo! I have won.'<br><br>Sakuni continued,&#8212;Thou hast, O son of Kunti, lost much wealth, horses<br>and elephants and thy brothers as well. Say, if thou hast anything which<br>thou hast not lost.'<br><br>Yudhishthira, said&#8212;'I alone, the eldest of all my brothers and dear unto<br>them, am still unwon. Won by thee, I will do what he that is won will<br>have to do.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Hearing this Sakuni, ready with the dice, adopting<br>foul means, said unto Yudhishthira, 'Lo! I have won.'<br><br>'Sakuni continued,&#8212;'Thou hast permitted thyself to be won. This is very<br>sinful. There is wealth still left to thee, O king. Therefore, thy having<br>lost thyself is certainly sinful.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Having said this, Sakuni, well-skilled at dice,<br>spoke unto all the brave kings present there of his having won, one after<br>another, all the Pandavas. The son of Suvala then, addressing<br>Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'O king, there is still one stake dear to thee that<br>is still unwon. Stake thou Krishna, the princess of Panchala. By her, win<br>thyself back.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'With Draupadi as stake, who is neither short nor<br>tall, neither spare nor corpulent, and who is possessed of blue curly<br>locks, I will now play with thee. Possessed of eyes like the leaves of<br>the autumn lotus, and fragrant also as the autumn lotus, equal in beauty<br>unto her (Lakshmi) who delighteth in autumn lotuses, and unto Sree<br>herself in symmetry and every grace she is such a woman as a man may<br>desire for wife in respect of softness of heart, and wealth of beauty and<br>of virtues. Possessed of every accomplishment and compassionate and<br>sweet-speeched, she is such a woman as a man may desire for wife in<br>respect of her fitness for the acquisition of virtue and pleasure and<br>wealth. Retiring to bed last and waking up first, she looketh after all<br>down to the cowherds and the shepherds. Her face too, when covered with<br>sweat, looketh as the lotus or the jasmine. Of slender waist like that of<br>the wasp, of long flowing locks, of red lips, and body without down, is<br>the princess of Panchala. O king, making the slender-waisted Draupadi,<br>who is even such as my stake, I will play with thee, O son of Suvala.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;'When the intelligent king Yudhishthira the just<br>has spoken thus,&#8212;'Fie!' 'Fie!' were the words that were uttered by all<br>the aged persons that were in the assembly. And the whole conclave was<br>agitated, and the kings who were present there all gave way to grief. And<br>Bhishma and Drona and Kripa were covered with perspiration. And Vidura<br>holding his head between his hands sat like one that had lost his reason.<br>He sat with face downwards giving way to his reflections and sighing like<br>a snake. But Dhritarashtra glad, at heart, asked repeatedly, 'Hath the<br>stake been won?' 'Hath the stake been won?' and could not conceal his<br>emotions. Karna with Dussassana and others laughed aloud, while tears<br>began to flow from the eyes of all other present in the assembly. And the<br>son of Suvala, proud of success and flurried with excitement and<br>repeating. Thou hast one stake, dear to thee, etc. said,&#8212;'Lo! I have<br>won' and took up the dice that had been cast."
