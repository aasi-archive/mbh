                            "Jarasandha said,&#8212;'I do not recollect if I ever acted injuriously<br>towards ye! Even upon a careful mental scrutiny I fail to see the injury<br>I did unto ye. When I have never done ye an injury, why, ye Brahmanas do<br>ye regard me, who am innocent, as your foe? O, answer me truly, for this,<br>indeed, is the rule followed by the honest. The mind is pained at the<br>injury to one's pleasure and morality. That Kshatriya who injures an<br>innocent man's (sources of) pleasure and morality even if he be otherwise<br>a great warrior and well-versed in all rules of morality, obtains,<br>without any doubt the fate of sinners (hereafter) and falls off from<br>prosperity. The practices of the Kshatriyas are the best of those that<br>are honest in the three worlds Indeed, those that are acquainted with<br>morality applaud the Kshatriya practices. Adhering to those practices of<br>my order with steady soul, I never injure those that are under me. In<br>bringing this charge, therefore, against me, it appears that ye speak<br>erroneously!'<br><br>"Krishna said,&#8212;'O thou of mighty arms, there is a certain person of the<br>head of a (royal) line who upholdeth the dignity of his race At his<br>command have we come against thee. Thou hast brought, O king, many of the<br>Kshatriyas of the world as captives (to thy city.) Having perpetrated<br>that wicked wrong how dost thou regard thyself as innocent? O best of<br>monarchs, how can a king act wrongfully towards other virtuous kings? But<br>thou, O king, treating other kings with cruelty, seekest to offer them as<br>sacrifice unto the god Rudra! O son of Vrihadratha, this sin committed by<br>thee may touch even us, for as we are virtuous in our practices, we are<br>capable of protecting virtue. The slaughter of human being as sacrifice<br>unto the gods is never seen. Why dost thou, therefore, seek to perform a<br>sacrifice unto god Sankara by slaughtering human beings? Thou art<br>addressing persons belonging to thy own order as animals (fit for<br>sacrifice)! Fool as thou art, who else, O Jarasandha, is capable of<br>behaving in this way? One always obtaineth the fruits of whatever acts<br>one performeth under whatever circumstances. Therefore, desirous as we<br>are of helping all distressed people, we have, for the prosperity of our<br>race, come hither to slay thee, the slaughterer of our relatives. Thou<br>thinkest that there is no man among the Kshatriyas (equal to thee). This,<br>O king, is a great error of judgment on thy part. What Kshatriya is<br>there, O king, who endued with greatness of soul and recollecting the<br>dignity of his own parentage, would not ascend to eternal heaven that<br>hath not its like anywhere, falling in open fight? Know O bull among men,<br>that Kshatriyas engage themselves in battle, as persons installed in<br>sacrifices, with heaven in view, and vanquish the whole world! Study of<br>the Vedas, great fame, ascetic penances, and death in battle, are all<br>acts that lead to heaven. The attainment of heaven by the three other<br>acts may be uncertain, but death in battle hath that for its certain<br>consequence. Death in battle is the sure cause of triumph like Indra's.<br>It is graced by numerous merits. It is for this reason that he of a<br>hundred sacrifices (Indra) hath become what he is, and by vanquishing the<br>Asuras he ruleth the universe. Hostility with whom else than thee is so<br>sure of leading to heaven, proud as thou art of the excessive strength of<br>thy vast Magadha host? Don't disregard others, O king. Valour dwelleth in<br>every man. O king of men, there are many men whose valour may be equal or<br>superior to thine. As long as these are not known, so long only art thou<br>noted for thy valour. Thy prowess, O king, can be borne by us. It is,<br>therefore, that I say so. O king of Magadha, cast off thy superiority and<br>pride in the presence of those that are thy equals. Go not, O king, with<br>thy children and ministers and army, into the regions of Yama.<br>Damvodhava, Kartavirya, Uttara, and Vrihadratha, were kings that met with<br>destruction, along with all their forces, for having disregarded their<br>superiors. Desirous of liberating the captive monarchs from thee, know<br>that we are certainly not Brahmanas. I am Hrishesha otherwise called<br>Sauri, and these two heroes among men are the sons of Pandu. O king of<br>Magadha, we challenge thee. Fight standing before us. Either set free all<br>the monarchs, or go thou to the abode of Yama.<br><br>"Jarasandha said,&#8212;'I never make a captive of a king without first<br>vanquishing him. Who hath been kept here that hath not been defeated in<br>war? This, O Krishna, it hath been said, is the duty that should be<br>followed by the Kshatriyas, viz., to bring others under sway by the<br>exhibition of prowess and then to treat them as slaves. Having gathered<br>these monarchs with the intention of offering them as sacrifices unto the<br>god, how shall I, O Krishna, from fear liberate them to-day, when I<br>recollect also the duty I have recited of a Kshatriya? With troops<br>against troops arrayed in order of battle, or alone against one, or<br>against two, or against three, at the same time or separately, I am ready<br>to fight.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Having spoken thus, and desiring to fight with those<br>heroes of terrible achievements, king Jarasandha ordered (his son)<br>Sahadeva to be installed on the throne. Then, O bull of the Bharata race,<br>the king, on the eve of battle, thought of his two generals Kausika and<br>Chitrasena. These two, O king, were formerly called by everybody in the<br>world of men by the respectful appellations of Hansa and Dimvaka. And, O<br>monarch, that tiger among men, the lord Sauri ever devoted to truth, the<br>slayer of Madhu, the younger brother of Haladhara, the foremost of all<br>persons having their senses under complete control, keeping in view the<br>command of Brahma and remembering that the ruler of Magadha was destined<br>to be slain in battle by Bhima and not by the descendant of Madhu<br>(Yadavas), desired not to slay himself king Jarasandha, that foremost of<br>all men endued with strength, that hero possessed of the prowess of a<br>tiger, that warrior of terrible valour."
