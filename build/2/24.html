                            Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"thus addressed, Bhima firmly resolved upon slaying<br>Jarasandha, replied unto Krishna of the Yadu race, saying,&#8212;O tiger of<br>the Yadu race, O Krishna, this wretch that yet stayeth before me with<br>sufficient strength and bent upon fight, should not be forgiven by me.<br>Hearing these words of Vrikodara (Bhima), that tiger among men, Krishna,<br>desiring to encourage that hero to accomplish the death of Jarasandha<br>without any delay, answered,&#8212;'O Bhima, exhibit today upon Jarasandha the<br>strength thou hast luckily derived, the might thou hast obtained from<br>(thy father), the god Maruta.' Thus addressed by Krishna, Bhima, that<br>slayer of foes, holding up in the air the powerful Jarasandha, began to<br>whirl him on high. And, O bull of the Bharata race, having so whirled him<br>in the air full hundred times, Bhima pressed his knee against<br>Jarasandha's backbone and broke his body in twain. And having killed him<br>thus, the mighty Vrikodara uttered a terrible roar. And the roar of the<br>Pandava mingling with that death knell of Jarasandha, while he was being<br>broken on Bhima's knee, caused a loud uproar that struck fear into the<br>heart of every creature. And all the citizens of Magadha became dumb with<br>terror and many women were even prematurely delivered. And hearing those<br>roars, the people of Magadha thought that either the Himavat was tumbling<br>down or the earth itself was being rent asunder. And those oppressors of<br>all foes then, leaving the lifeless body of the king at the palace gate<br>where he lay as one asleep, went out of the town. And Krishna, causing<br>Jarasandha's car furnished with an excellent flagstaff to be made ready<br>and making the brothers (Bhima and Arjuna) ride in it, went in and<br>released his (imprisoned) relatives. And those kings rescued from<br>terrible fate, rich in the possession of jewels, approaching Krishna made<br>presents unto him of jewels and gems. And having vanquished his foe,<br>Krishna furnished with weapons and unwounded and accompanied by the kings<br>(he had released), came out of Girivraja riding in that celestial car (of<br>Jarasandha). And he also who could wield the bow with both hands<br>(Arjuna), who was incapable of being vanquished by any of the monarchs on<br>earth, who was exceedingly handsome in person and well-skilled in the<br>destruction of the foe, accompanied by the possessor of great strength<br>(Bhima), came out of that tort with Krishna driving the car whereon he<br>rode. And that best of cars, incapable of being vanquished by any king,<br>ridden in by those warriors Bhima and Arjuna, and driven by Krishna,<br>looked exceedingly handsome. Indeed, it was upon that car that Indra and<br>Vishnu had fought of old in the battle (with the Asuras) in which Taraka<br>(the wife of Vrihaspati) had become the immediate cause of much<br>slaughter. And riding upon that car Krishna now came out of the<br>hill-fort. Possessed of the splendour of heated gold, and decked with<br>rows of jingling bells and furnished with wheels whose clatter was like<br>the roar of clouds, and ever victorious in battle, and always<br>slaughtering the foe against whom it was driven, it was that very car<br>riding upon which Indra had slain ninety-nine Asuras of old. And those<br>bulls among men (the three cousins) having obtained that car became<br>exceedingly glad. The people of Magadha, behold the long-armed Krishna<br>along with the two brothers, seated in that car (of Jarasandha) wondered<br>much. O Bharata, that car, whereunto were yoked celestial horses and<br>which possessed the speed of the wind, thus ridden upon by Krishna,<br>looked exceedingly beautiful. And upon that best of cars was a flag-staff<br>without being visibly attached thereto, and which was the product of<br>celestial skill. And the handsome flag-staff, possessed of the splendour<br>of the rainbow, could be seen from the distance of a yojana. And Krishna<br>while, coming out, thought of Garuda. And Garuda, thought of by his<br>master, came thither in no time, like a tree of vast proportions standing<br>in a village worshipped by all. Garuda of immense weight of body and<br>living upon snakes sat upon that excellent car along with the numberless<br>open-mouthed and frightfully-roaring creatures on its flag-staff. And<br>thereupon that best of cars became still more dazzling with its splendour<br>and was as incapable of being looked at by created being as the midday<br>sun surrounded by a thousand rays. And, O king, such was that best of<br>flag-staffs of celestial make that it never struck against any tree nor<br>could any weapon injure it at all even though visible to men's eyes. And<br>Achyuta, that tiger among men, riding with the two sons of Pandu upon<br>that celestial car, the clatter of whose wheels was like the roar of the<br>clouds, came out of Girivraja. The car upon which Krishna rode had been<br>obtained by king Vasu from Vasava, and from Vasu by Vrihadratha, and from<br>the latter in due course by king Jarasandha. And he of long arms and eyes<br>like lotus-petals and possessed of illustrious reputation, coming out of<br>Girivraja, stopped (for some time) on a level plain outside the town.<br>And, O king, all the citizens then, with the Brahmanas at their head,<br>hastened thither to adore him with due religious rites. And the kings who<br>had been released from confinement worshipped the slayer of Madhu with<br>reverence, and addressing him with eulogies said,&#8212;O thou of long arms,<br>thou hast to-day rescued us, sunk in the deep mire of sorrow in the hand<br>of Jarasandha. Such an act of virtue by thee, O son of Devaki, assisted<br>by the might of Bhima and Arjuna, is most extraordinary. O Vishnu,<br>languishing as we all were in the terrible hill-fort of Jarasandha, it<br>was verily from sheer good fortune alone that thou hast rescued us, O son<br>of the Yadu race, and achieved thereby a remarkable reputation. O tiger<br>among men, we bow down to thee. O, command us what we shall do. However<br>difficult of accomplishment, thy command being made known to us, O lord<br>(Krishna), it will at once be accomplished by us. Thus addressed by the<br>monarchs, the high-souled Hrishikesa gave them every assurance and<br>said,&#8212;'Yudhishthira is desirous of performing the sacrifice of Rajasuya.<br>That monarch, ever guided by virtue, is solicitous of acquiring the<br>imperial dignity. Having known this from me assist ye him in his<br>endeavours. Then, O king, all those monarchs with joyous hearts accepted<br>the words of Krishna, saying,&#8212;'So be it! And saying this, those lords of<br>earth made presents of jewels unto him of the Dasarha race. And Govinda,<br>moved by kindness towards them, took a portion of those presents,<br><br>"Then the son of Jarasandha, the high-souled Sahadeva, accompanied by his<br>relatives and the principal officers of state, and with his priest in<br>front came thither. And the prince, bending himself low and making large<br>presents of jewels and precious stones, worshipped Vasudeva, that god<br>among men. Then that best of men, Krishna, giving every assurance unto<br>the prince afflicted with fear, accepted those presents of his of great<br>value. And Krishna joyfully installed the prince there and then in the<br>sovereignty of Magadha. And the strong-armed and illustrious son of<br>Jarasandha, thus installed on the throne by those most exalted of men and<br>having obtained the friendship of Krishna and treated with respect and<br>kindness by the two sons of Pritha, re-entered the city of his father.<br>And that bull amongst men, Krishna, accompanied by the sons of Pritha and<br>graced with great good fortune, left the city of Magadha, laden with<br>numerous jewels. Accompanied by the two sons of Pandu, Achyuta (Krishna)<br>arrived at Indraprastha, and approaching Yudhishthira joyfully addressing<br>that monarch said,&#8212;'O best of kings, from good fortune, the mighty<br>Jarasandha hath been slain by Bhima, and the kings confined (at<br>Girivraja) have been all set free. From good fortune also, these two,<br>Bhima and Dhananjaya, are well and arrived, O Bharata, it their own city<br>unwounded. Then Yudhishthira worshipped Krishna as he deserved and<br>embraced Bhima and Arjuna in joy. And the monarch who had no enemy,<br>having obtained victory through the agency of his brothers in consequence<br>of the death of Jarasandha, gave himself up to pleasure and merriment<br>with all his brothers. And the oldest son of Pandu (Yudhisthira) together<br>with his brothers approached the kings who had come to Indraprastha and<br>entertaining and worshipping them, each according to his age, dismissed<br>them all. Commanded by Yudhishthira those kings with joyful hearts, set<br>out for their respective countries without loss of time, riding upon<br>excellent vehicles. Thus, O king, did that tiger among men. Janardana of<br>great intelligence, caused his foe Jarasandha to be slain through the<br>instrumentality of the Pandavas. And, O Bharata, that chastiser of all<br>foes having thus caused Jarasandha to be slain, took leave of<br>Yudhishthira and Pritha, and Draupadi and Subhadra, and Bhimasena and<br>Arjuna and the twins Nakula and Sahadeva. After taking leave of<br>Dhananjaya also, he set out for his own city (of Dwarka), riding upon<br>that best of cars of celestial make, possessed of the speed of the mind<br>and given unto him by Yudhishthira, filling the ten points of the horizon<br>with the deep rattle of its wheels. And, O bull of the Bharata race, just<br>as Krishna was on the point of setting out, the Pandavas with<br>Yudhishthira at their head walked round that tiger among men who was<br>never fatigued with exertion.'<br><br>"And after the illustrious Krishna, the son of Devaki, had departed (from<br>Indraprastha) having acquired that great victory and having also<br>dispelled the fears of the kings, that feat, O Bharata, swelled the fame<br>of the Pandavas. And, O king, the Pandavas passed their days, continuing<br>to gladden the heart of Draupadi. And at that time, whatever was proper<br>and consistent with virtue, pleasure, and profit, continued to be<br>properly executed by king Yudhishthira in the exercise of his duties of<br>protecting his subjects."
