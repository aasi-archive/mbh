                            "Dhritrashtra said,&#8212;Thou art my eldest son and born also of my eldest<br>wife. Therefore, O son, be not jealous of the Pandavas. He that is<br>jealous is always unhappy and suffereth the pangs of death. O bull of the<br>Bharata race, Yudhishthira knoweth not deception, possesseth wealth equal<br>unto thine, hath thy friends for his, and is not jealous of thee. Why<br>shouldst thou, therefore, be jealous of him? O king, in respect of<br>friends and allies thou art equal unto Yudhishthira. Why shouldst thou,<br>therefore, covet, from folly, the property of thy brother? Be not so.<br>Cease to be jealous. Do not grieve. O bull of the Bharata race, it thou<br>covetest the dignity attaching to the performance of a sacrifice, let the<br>priests arrange for thee the great sacrifice, called the Saptatantu. The<br>kings of the earth will then, cheerfully and with great respect, bring<br>for thee also much wealth and gems and ornaments. O child, coveting<br>other's possessions is exceedingly mean. He, on the other hand, enjoyeth<br>happiness, who is content with his own being engaged in the practices of<br>his own order. Never striving to obtain the wealth of others, persevering<br>in one's own affairs, and protecting what hath been earned,&#8212;these are<br>the indications of true greatness. He that is unmoved in calamity,<br>skilled in his own business, ever exerting vigilant and humble, always<br>beholdeth prosperity. The sons of Pandu are as thy arms. Do not lop off<br>those arms of thine. Plunge not into internal dissensions for the sake of<br>that wealth of thy brothers. O king, be not jealous of the sons of Pandu.<br>Thy wealth is equal unto that of thy brothers in his entirety. There is<br>great sin in quarrelling with friends. They that are thy grandsires are<br>theirs also. Give away in charity on occasions of sacrifices, gratify<br>every dear object of thy desire, disport in the company of women freely,<br>and enjoy thou peace.'"
