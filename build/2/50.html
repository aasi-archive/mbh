                            Duryodhana said,&#8212;'Listen now, O Bharata, about all the most costly<br>articles I saw, belonging unto the sons of Pandu, and brought one after<br>another by the kings of the earth. Beholding that wealth of the foe, I<br>lost my reason and scarcely knew myself. And, O Bharata, listen as I<br>describe that wealth consisting of both manufactures and the produce of<br>the land. The king of Kamboja gave innumerable skins of the best king,<br>and blankets made of wool, of the soft fur of rodents and other<br>burroughers, and of the hair of cats,&#8212;all inlaid with threads of gold.<br>And he also gave three hundred horses of the Titteti and the Kalmasha<br>species possessing noses like parrots. And he also gave three hundred<br>camels and an equal number of she-asses, all fattened with the olives and<br>the Pilusha. And innumerable Brahmanas engaged in rearing cattle and<br>occupied in low offices for the gratification of the illustrious king<br>Yudhishthira the just waited at the gate with three hundred millions of<br>tribute but they were denied admission into the palace. And hundred upon<br>hundreds of Brahmanas possessing wealth of kine and living upon the lands<br>that Yudhishthira had given them, came there with their handsome golden<br>Kamandalus filled with clarified butter. And though they had brought such<br>tribute, they were refused admission into the palace. And the Sudra kings<br>that dwelt in the regions on the seacoast, brought with them, O king,<br>hundred thousands of serving girls of the Karpasika country, all of<br>beautiful features and slender waist and luxuriant hair and decked in<br>golden ornaments; and also many skins of the Ranku deer worthy even of<br>Brahmanas as tribute unto king Yudhishthira. And the tribes Vairamas,<br>Paradas, Tungas, with the Kitavas who lived upon crops that depended on<br>water from the sky or of the river and also they who were born in regions<br>on the sea-shore, in woodlands, or countries on the other side of the<br>ocean waited at the gate, being refused permission to enter, with goats<br>and kine and asses and camels and vegetable, honey and blankets and<br>jewels and gems of various kinds. And that great warrior king Bhagadatta,<br>the brave ruler of Pragjyotisha and the mighty sovereign of the<br>mlechchas, at the head of a large number of Yavanas waited at the gate<br>unable to enter, with a considerable tribute comprising of horses of the<br>best breed and possessing the speed of the wind. And king Bhagadatta<br>(beholding the concourse) had to go away from the gate, making over a<br>number of swords with handles made of the purest ivory and well-adorned<br>with diamonds and every kind of gems. And many tribes coming from<br>different regions, of whom some possess two eyes, some three and some had<br>eyes on their foreheads, and those also called Aushmikas, and Nishadas,<br>and Romakas, some cannibals and many possessing only one leg. I say, O<br>king, standing at the gate, being refused permission to enter. And these<br>diverse rulers brought as tribute ten thousand asses of diverse hues and<br>black necks and huge bodies and great speed and much docility and<br>celebrated all over the world. And these asses were all of goodly size<br>and delightful colour. And they were all bred on the coast of Vankhu. And<br>there were many kings that gave unto Yudhishthira much gold and silver.<br>And having given much tribute they obtained admission into the palace of<br>Yudhishthira. The people that came there possessing only one leg gave<br>unto Yudhishthira many wild horses, some of which were as red as the<br>cochineal, and some white, and some possessing the hues of the rainbow<br>and some looking like evening clouds, and some that were of variegated<br>colour. And they were all endued with the speed of the mind. And they<br>also gave unto the king enough gold of superior quality. I also saw<br>numberless Chins and Sakas and Uddras and many barbarous tribes living in<br>the woods, and many Vrishnis and Harahunas, and dusky tribes of the<br>Himavat, and many Nipas and people residing in regions on the sea-coast,<br>waiting at the gate being refused permission to enter. And the people of<br>Valhika gave unto him as tribute ten thousand asses, of goodly size and<br>black necks and daily running two hundred miles, And those asses were of<br>many shapes. And they were well-trained and celebrated all over the<br>world. And possessed of symmetrical proportion and excellent colour,<br>their skins were pleasant to the touch. And the Valhikas also presented<br>numerous blankets of woollen texture manufactured in Chin and numerous<br>skins of the Ranku deer, and clothes manufactured from jute, and others<br>woven with the threads spun by insects. And they also gave thousands of<br>other clothes not made of cotton, possessing the colour of the lotus. And<br>these were all of smooth texture. And they also gave soft sheep-skins by<br>thousands. And they also gave many sharp and long swords and scimitars,<br>and hatchets and fine-edged battle-axes manufactured in the western<br>countries. And having presented perfumes and jewels and gems of various<br>kinds by thousands as tribute, they waited at the gate, being refused<br>admission into the palace. And the Sakas and Tukhatas and Tukharas and<br>Kankas and Romakas and men with horns bringing with them as tribute<br>numerous large elephants and ten thousand horses, and hundreds and<br>hundreds of millions of gold waited at the gate, being refused permission<br>to enter. And the kings of the eastern countries having presented<br>numerous valuable articles including many costly carpets and vehicles and<br>beds, and armours of diverse hues decked with jewels and gold and ivory,<br>and weapons of various kinds, and cars of various shapes and handsome<br>make and adorned with gold, with well-trained horses trimmed with tiger<br>skins, and rich and variegated blankets for caprisoning elephants, and<br>various kinds of jewels and gems, arrows long and short and various other<br>kinds of weapons, obtained permission to enter the sacrificial palace of<br>the illustrious Pandava!'"
