                            Vaisampayana said,&#8212;'The royal messenger, agreeably to the commands of<br>the intelligent king Dhritarashtra, coming upon Yudhishthira, the son of<br>Pritha who had by that time gone a great way, addressed the monarch and<br>said,&#8212;'Even these are the words of thy father-like uncle, O Bharata,<br>spoken unto thee, 'The assembly is ready. O son of Pandu, O king<br>Yudhisthira, come and cast the dice.'<br><br>Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'Creatures obtain fruits good and ill according to<br>the dispensation of the Ordainer of the creation. Those fruits are<br>inevitable whether I play or not. This is a summons to dice; it is,<br>besides the command of the old king. Although I know that it will prove<br>destructive to me, yet I cannot refuse.'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Although (a living) animal made of gold was an<br>impossibility, yet Rama suffered himself to be tempted by a (golden)<br>deer. Indeed, the minds of men over whom calamities hang, became deranged<br>and out of order. Yudhishthira, therefore, having said these words,<br>retraced his steps along with his brothers. And knowing full well the<br>deception practised by Sakuni, the son of Pritha came back to sit at dice<br>with him again. These mighty warriors again entered that assembly,<br>afflicting the hearts of all their friends. And compelled by Fate they<br>once more sat down at ease for gambling for the destruction of<br>themselves."<br><br>"Sakuni then said,&#8212;'The old king hath given ye back all your wealth.<br>That is well. But, O bull of the Bharata race, listen to me, there is a<br>stake of great value. Either defeated by ye at dice, dressed in deer<br>skins we shall enter the great forest and live there for twelve years<br>passing the whole of the thirteenth year in some inhabited region,<br>unrecognised, and if recognised return to an exile of another twelve<br>years; or vanquished by us, dressed in deer skins ye shall, with Krishna,<br>live for twelve years in the woods passing the whole of the thirteenth<br>year unrecognised, in some inhabited region. If recognised, an exile of<br>another twelve years is to be the consequence. On the expiry of the<br>thirteenth year, each is to have his kingdom surrendered by the other. O<br>Yudhishthira, with this resolution, play with us, O Bharata, casting the<br>dice.'<br><br>"At these words, they that were in that assembly, raising up their arms<br>said in great anxiety of mind, and from the strength of their feelings<br>these words,&#8212;'Alas, fie on the friends of Duryodhana that they do not<br>apprise him of his great danger. Whether he, O bull among the Bharatas,<br>(Dhritarashtra) understandeth or not, of his own sense, it is thy duty to<br>tell him plainly."<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;King Yudhishthira, even hearing these various<br>remarks, from shame and a sense of virtue again sat at dice. And though<br>possessed of great intelligence and fully knowing the consequences, he<br>again began to play, as if knowing that the destruction of the Kurus was<br>at hand.<br><br>"And Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'How can, O Sakuni, a king like me, always<br>observant of the uses of his own order, refuse, when summoned to dice?<br>Therefore I play with thee."<br><br>"Sakuni answered,&#8212;'We have many kine and horses, and milch cows, and an<br>infinite number of goats and sheep; and elephants and treasures and gold<br>and slaves both male and female. All these were staked by us before but<br>now let this be our one stake, viz., exile into the woods,&#8212;being<br>defeated either ye or we will dwell in the woods (for twelve years) and<br>the thirteenth year, unrecognised, in some inhabited place. Ye bulls<br>among men, with this determination, will we play."<br><br>"O Bharata, this proposal about a stay in the woods was uttered but once.<br>The son of Pritha, however, accepted it and Sakuni took up the dice. And<br>casting them he said unto Yudhishthira,&#8212;'Lo, I have won."
