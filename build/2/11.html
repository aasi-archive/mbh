                            "Narada said,&#8212;Listen to me, O child, as I tell thee of the assembly<br>house of the Grandsire, that house which none can describe, saying it is<br>such. In the Krita (golden) age of old, O king, the exalted deity Aditya<br>(once) came down from heaven into the world of men. Having seen before<br>the assembly-house of Brahma the Self-created, Aditya was cheerfully<br>wandering over the Earth in human form, desirous of beholding what could<br>be seen here. It was on that occasion, O son of Pandu, that the god of<br>day spoke unto me, O bull of the Bharata race, of that celestial Sabha<br>(assembly) of the Grandsire, immeasurable and immaterial and<br>indescribable, as regards form and shape, and capable of delighting the<br>heart of every creature by its splendour. Hearing, O bull of the Bharata<br>race, of the merits of that Sabha, I became, O king, desirous of<br>beholding it. I then asked Aditya, saying,&#8212;O exalted one, I desire to<br>behold the sacred Sabha of the Grandsire. O lord of light, tell me, O<br>exalted one, by what ascetic penances, or by what acts, or by what charms<br>or by what rites, I may be enabled to behold that excellent sin-cleaning<br>Sabha."&#8212;Hearing these words of mine, Aditya the god of day, the deity of<br>a thousand rays, answered me, O chief of the Bharata race, thus: Observe<br>thou, with mind rapt in meditation, the Brahma vow extending for a<br>thousand years. Repairing then to the breast of the Himavat, I commenced<br>that great vow, and after I had completed it the exalted and sinless<br>deity Surya endued with great energy, and knowing no fatigue, took me<br>with him to the Sabha of the Grandsire. O king, it is impossible to<br>describe that Sabha, saying&#8212;it is such, for within a moment it assumes a<br>different form that language fails to paint. O Bharata, it is impossible<br>to indicate its dimensions or shape. I never saw anything like it before.<br>Ever contributing to the happiness of those within it, its atmosphere is<br>neither cold nor warm. Hunger and thirst or any kind of uneasiness<br>disappear as soon as one goeth thither. It seems to be made up of<br>brilliant gems of many kinds. It doth not seem to be supported on<br>columns, it knoweth no deterioration, being eternal. That self effulgent<br>mansion, by its numerous blazing, celestial indications of unrivalled<br>splendour, seems to surpass the moon, the sun and the fire in splendour.<br>Stationed in heaven, it blazes forth, censuring as it were the maker of<br>the day. In that mansion O king, the Supreme Deity, the Grand-sire of all<br>created things, having himself created everything by virtue of his<br>creative illusion, stayeth ever. And Daksha, Prachetas, Pulaha, Marichi,<br>the master Kasyapa, Bhrigu, Atri, and Vasistha and Gautama, and also<br>Angiras, and Pulastya, Kraut, Prahlada, and Kardama, these Prajapatis,<br>and Angirasa of the Atharvan Veda, the Valikhilyas, the Marichipas;<br>Intelligence, Space, Knowledge, Air, Heat, Water, Earth, Sound, Touch,<br>Form, Taste, Scent; Nature, and the Modes (of Nature), and the elemental<br>and prime causes of the world,&#8212;all stay in that mansion beside the lord<br>Brahma. And Agastya of great energy, and Markandeya, of great ascetic<br>power, and Jamadagni and Bharadwaja, and Samvarta, and Chyavana, and<br>exalted Durvasa, and the virtuous Rishyasringa, the illustrious<br>Sanatkumara of great ascetic merit and the preceptor in all matters<br>affecting Yoga; Asita and Devala, and Jaigishavya acquainted with truth;<br>Rishava, Ajitasatru, and Mani of great energy; and the Science of healing<br>with its eight branches&#8212;all in their personified forms, O Bharata; the<br>moon with all the stars and the stellar conjunctions; Aditya with all his<br>rays; the winds; the Sacrifices, the Declarations of purpose (in<br>sacrifices), the Vital principles,&#8212;these illustrious and vow-observing<br>beings in their personified forms, and many others too numerous to<br>mention, attend all upon Brahma in that mansion. Wealth and Religion and<br>Desire, and Joy, and Aversion, and Asceticism and Tranquillity&#8212;all wait<br>together upon the Supreme Deity in that palace. The twenty tribes of the<br>Gandharvas and Apsaras, as also their seven other tribes, and all the<br>Lokapalas (chief protectors of several regions), and Sukra, and<br>Vrihaspati, and Vudha, and Angaraka (Mangala), Sani, Rahu, and the other<br>planets; the Mantras (of the Sama Veda), the special Mantras (of the same<br>Veda); (the rites of) Harimat and Vasumat, the Adityas with Indra, the<br>two Agnis mentioned by name (viz. Agnisoma and Indragni), the Marutas,<br>Viswakarman, and the Vasus, O Bharata; the Pitris, and all kinds of<br>sacrificial libations, the four Vedas. viz., Rig, Sama, Yajuh, and<br>Atharva; all Sciences and branches of learning; Histories and all minor<br>branches of learning; the several branches of the Vedas; the planets, the<br>Sacrifices, the Soma, all the deities; Savitri (Gayatri), the seven kinds<br>of rhyme; Understanding, Patience, Memory, Wisdom, Intelligence, Fame,<br>Forgiveness; the Hymns of the Sama Veda; the Science of hymns in general,<br>and various kinds of Verses and Songs; various Commentaries with<br>arguments;&#8212;all in their personified forms, O king, and various Dramas<br>and Poems and Stories and abridged Glosses&#8212;these also, and many others<br>wait upon the Supreme Deity in that Sabha, Kshanas, Lavas, Muhurtas, Day,<br>Night, Fortnights, Months, the six Seasons, O Bharata, Years, Yugas, the<br>four kinds of Days and Nights (viz., appearing to man, to the Pitris, to<br>the gods, and to Brahma) and that eternal, indestructible,<br>undeteriorating, excellent Wheel of Time and also the Wheel of<br>Virtue,&#8212;these always wait there. O Yudhishthira; and Aditi, Diti, Danu,<br>Surasa, Vinata, Ira, Kalika, Suravi, Devi, Sarama, Gautami and the<br>goddesses Pradha, and Kadru;&#8212;these mothers of the celestials, and<br>Rudrani, Sree, Lakshmi, Bhadra, Shashthi, the Earth, Ganga, Hri, Swaha,<br>Kriti, the goddess Sura, Sachi Pushti, Arundhati, Samvritti, Asa, Niyati,<br>Srishti, Rati,&#8212;these and many other goddesses wait upon the Creator of<br>all. The Adityas, Vasus, Rudras, Marutas, Aswinas, the Viswadevas<br>Sadhyas, and the Pitris gifted with the speed of the mind; these all wait<br>there upon the Grandsire. And, O bull amongst men, know thou that there<br>are seven classes of Pitris, of which four classes have embodied forms<br>and the remaining three without embodied forms. It is well known that the<br>illustrious Vairajas and Agniswattas and Garhapattyas (three classes of<br>Pitris) range in heaven. And those amongst the Pitris that are called the<br>Somapas, the Ekasringras, the Chaturvedas, and the Kalas, are ever<br>worshipped amongst the four orders of men. Gratified with the Soma<br>(juice), first, these gratify Soma afterwards. All these tribes of Pitris<br>wait upon the Lord of the creation and cheerfully worship the Supreme<br>Deity of immeasurable energy. And Rakshasas, Pisachas, the Danavas and<br>Guhyakas; Nagas, Birds, and various animals; and all mobile and immobile<br>great beings;&#8212;all worship the Grandsire. And Purandara the chief of the<br>celestials, and Varuna and Kuvera and Yama, and Mahadeva accompanied by<br>Uma, always repair thither. And, O king of kings, Mahasena (Kartikeya)<br>also adoreth there the Grandsire. Narayana himself, and the celestial<br>Rishis, and those Rishis called Valakhillyas, and all beings born of<br>females and all those not born of females, and whatever else is seen in<br>the three worlds&#8212;both mobile and immobile, were all seen by me there,<br>know O king. And eighty thousand Rishis with vital seed drawn up, and O<br>Pandu, fifty thousand Rishis having sons, were all seen by me there. And<br>all the dwellers in heaven repairing thither behold the Supreme Deity<br>when they please, and worshipping him with a bow of their head return<br>whence they came. And, O king of men, the Grandsire of all created<br>beings, the Soul of the universe, the Self create Brahma of immeasurable<br>intelligence and glory, equally kind unto all creatures, honoureth as<br>they deserve, and gratifieth with sweet speech and gift of wealth and<br>other enjoyable articles, the gods, the Daityas, the Nagas, the<br>Brahmanas, the Yakshas, the Birds, the Kaleyas, the Gandharvas, the<br>Apsaras, and all other exalted beings that came to him as his guests. And<br>that delicious Sabha, O child, is always crowded with persons coming and<br>going. Filled with every kind of energy, and worshipped by Brahmarshis,<br>that celestial Sabha blazes forth with the graceful possessions of Brahma<br>and looks extremely handsome, O tiger among kings as this Sabha of yours<br>is unrivalled in the world of men, so is that Sabha of Brahma, seen by me<br>unrivalled in all the worlds. I have seen these Sabhas, O Bharata, in<br>regions of the celestials. This thy Sabha is unquestionably the foremost<br>in the world of men!"
