                            "Bhishma said,&#8212;This Sisupala was born in the line of the king of Chedi<br>with three eyes and four hands. As soon as he was born, he screamed and<br>brayed like an ass. On that account, his father and mother along with<br>their relatives, were struck with fear. And beholding these extraordinary<br>omens, his parents resolved to abandon him. But an incorporeal voice,<br>about this time, said unto the king and his wife with their ministers and<br>priest, all with hearts paralysed by anxiety, those words,&#8212;'This thy<br>son, O king, that hath been born will become both fortunate and superior<br>in strength. Therefore thou hast no fear from him. Indeed cherish the<br>child without anxiety. He will not die (in childhood). His time is not<br>yet come. He that will slay him with weapons hath also been born.'<br>Hearing these words, the mother, rendered anxious by affection for her<br>son, addressed the invisible Being and said,&#8212;I bow with joined hands<br>unto him that hath uttered these words respecting my son; whether he be<br>an exalted divinity or any other being, let him tell me another word, I<br>desire to hear who will be the slayer of this my son. The invisible Being<br>then said,&#8212;'He upon whose lap this child being placed the superfluous<br>arms of his will fall down upon the ground like a pair of five-headed<br>snakes, and at the sight of whom his third eye on the forehead will<br>disappear, will be his slayer?' Hearing of the child's three eyes and<br>four arms as also of the words of the invisible Being, all the kings of<br>the earth went to Chedi to behold him. The king of Chedi worshipping, as<br>each deserved, the monarchs that came, gave his child upon their laps one<br>after another. And though the child was placed upon the laps of a<br>thousand kings, one after another, yet that which the incorporeal voice<br>had said came not to pass. And having heard of all this at Dwaravati, the<br>mighty Yadava heroes Sankarshana and Janarddana also went to the capital<br>of the Chedis, to see their father's sister&#8212;that daughter of the Yadavas<br>(the queen of Chedi) And saluting everybody according to his rank and the<br>king and queen also, and enquiring after every body's welfare, both Rama<br>and Kesava took their seats. And after those heroes had been worshipped,<br>the queen with great pleasure herself placed the child on the lap of<br>Damodara. As soon as the child was placed on his lap, those superfluous<br>arms of his fell down and the eye on his forehead also disappeared. And<br>beholding this, the queen in alarm and anxiety begged of Krishna a boon.<br>And she said,&#8212;'O mighty-armed Krishna, I am afflicted with fear; grant<br>me a boon. Thou art the assurer of all afflicted ones and that the<br>dispeller of everybody's fear. Thus addressed by her. Krishna, that son<br>of the Yadu race, said&#8212;'Fear not, O respected one. Thou art acquainted<br>with morality. Thou needest have no fear from me. What boon shall I give<br>thee? What shall I do, O aunt? Whether able or not, I shall do thy<br>bidding.'&#8212;Thus spoken to by Krishna, the queen said, 'O thou of great<br>strength, thou wilt have to pardon the offences of Sisupala for my sake.<br>O tiger of the Yadu race. Know O lord, even this is the boon that I ask.'<br>Krishna then said, 'O aunt, even when he will deserve to be slain, I will<br>pardon an hundred offences of his. Grieve thou not.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued,&#8212;'Even thus, O Bhima, is this wretch of a<br>king&#8212;Sisupala of wicked heart, who, proud of the boon granted by<br>Govinda, summons thee to battle!'"
