                            "Bhishma said,&#8212;The will under which the ruler of Chedi summoneth thee to<br>fight though thou art of strength that knoweth no deterioration, is<br>scarcely his own intention. Assuredly, this is the purpose of Krishna<br>himself, the lord of the universe. O Bhima, what king is there on earth<br>that would dare abuse me thus, as this wretch of his race, already<br>possessed by Death, hath done to-day? This mighty-armed one is, without<br>doubt, a portion of Hari's energy. And surely, the Lord desireth to take<br>back unto himself that energy of his own. In consequence of this, O tiger<br>of the Kuru race, this tiger-like king of Chedi, so wicked of heart,<br>roareth in such a way caring little for us all."<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Hearing these words of Bhishma, the king of<br>Chedi could bear no more, He then replied in rage unto Bhishma in these<br>words.&#8212;<br><br>'Let our foes, O Bhishma, be endued with that prowess which this Kesava<br>hath, whom thou like a professional chanter of hymns praisest, rising<br>repeatedly from thy seat. If thy mind, O Bhishma, delighteth so in<br>praising others, then praise thou these kings, leaving off Krishna.<br>Praise thou this excellent of kings, Darada, the ruler of Valhika, who<br>rent this earth as soon as he was born. Praise thou, O Bhishma, this<br>Karna, the ruler of the territories of Anga and Vanga, who is equal in<br>strength unto him of a thousand eyes, who draweth a large bow, who endued<br>with mighty arms owneth celestial ear-rings of heavenly make with which<br>he was born and this coat of mail possessing the splendour of the rising<br>sun, who vanquished in a wrestling encounter the invincible Jarasandha<br>equal unto Vasava himself, and who tore and mangled that monarch. O<br>Bhishma, praise Drona and Aswatthaman, who both father and son, are<br>mighty warriors, worthy of praise, and the best of Brahmanas, and either<br>of whom, O Bhishma, if enraged could annihilate this earth with its<br>mobile and immobile creatures, as I believe. I do not behold, O Bhishma,<br>the king that is equal in battle unto Drona or Aswatthaman. Why wishest<br>thou not to praise them? Passing over Duryyodhana, that mighty-armed king<br>of kings, who is unequalled in whole earth girt with her seas and king<br>Jayadratha accomplished in weapons and endued with great prowess, and<br>Druma the preceptor of the Kimpurushas and celebrated over the world for<br>prowess, and Saradwata's son, old Kripa, the preceptor of the Bharata<br>princes and endued with great energy, why dost thou praise Kesava?<br>Passing over that foremost of bowmen&#8212;that excellent of kings, Rukmin of<br>great energy, why praisest thou Kesava? Passing over Bhishmaka of<br>abundant energy, and king Dantavakra, and Bhagadatta known for his<br>innumerable sacrificial stakes, and Jayatsena the king of the Magadha,<br>and Virata and Drupada, and Sakuni and Vrihadvala, and Vinda and Anuvinda<br>of Avant Pandya, Sweta Uttama Sankhya of great prosperity, the proud<br>Vrishasena, the powerful Ekalavya, and the great charioteer Kalinga of<br>abundant energy, why dost thou praise Kesava? And, O Bhishma, if thy mind<br>is always inclined to sing the praises of others, why dost thou not<br>praise Salya and other rulers of the earth? O king, what can be done by<br>me when (it seemeth) thou hast not heard anything before from virtuous<br>old men giving lessons in morality? Hast thou never heard, O Bhishma,<br>that reproach and glorification, both of self and others, are not<br>practices of those that are respectable? There is no one that approveth<br>thy conduct, O Bhishma, in unceasingly praising with devotion, from<br>ignorance alone, Kesava so unworthy of praise. How dost thou, from thy<br>wish alone, establish the whole universe in the servitor and cowherd of<br>Bhoja (Kansa)? Perhaps, O Bharata, this thy inclination is not<br>conformable to thy true nature, like to what may be in the bird Bhulinga,<br>as hath already been said by me. There is a bird called Bhulinga living<br>on the other side of the Himavat. O Bhishma, that bird ever uttereth<br>words of adverse import. Never do anything rash,&#8212;this is what she always<br>sayeth, but never understandeth that she herself always acteth very<br>rashly. Possessed of little intelligence that bird picketh from the<br>lion's mouth the pieces of flesh sticking between the teeth, and at a<br>time when the lion is employed in eating. Assuredly, O Bhishma, that bird<br>liveth at the pleasure of the lion. O sinful wretch, thou always speakest<br>like that bird. And assuredly, O Bhishma, thou art alive at the pleasure<br>only of these kings. Employed in acts contrary to the opinions of all,<br>there is none else like thee!"<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;Hearing these harsh words of the ruler of<br>Chedi, Bhishma, O king, said in the hearing of the king of Chedi,&#8212;'Truly<br>am I alive at the pleasure of these rulers of earth. But I do regard<br>these kings as not equal to even a straw.' As soon as these words were<br>spoken by Bhishma, the kings became inflamed with wrath. And the down of<br>some amongst them stood erect and some began to reprove Bhishma. And<br>hearing those words of Bhishma, some amongst them, that were wielders of<br>large bows exclaimed, 'This wretched Bhishma, though old, is exceedingly<br>boastful. He deserveth not our pardon. Therefore, ye kings, incensed with<br>rage as this Bhishma is, it is well that this wretch were slain like an<br>animal, or, mustering together, let us burn him in a fire of grass or<br>straw.' Hearing these words of the monarchs, Bhishma the grand-sire of<br>the Kurus, endued with great intelligence, addressing those lords of<br>earth, said,&#8212;'I do not see the end of our speeches, for words may be<br>answered with words. Therefore, ye lords of earth, listen ye all unto<br>what I say. Whether I be slain like an animal or burnt in a fire of grass<br>and straw, thus do I distinctly place my foot on the heads of ye all.<br>Here is Govinda, that knoweth no deterioration. Him have we worshipped.<br>Let him who wisheth for speedy death, summon to battle Madhava of dark<br>hue and the wielder of the discus and the mace; and falling enter into<br>and mingle with the body of this god!"
