                            (Jarasandhta-badha Parva)<br><br>"Krishna said,&#8212;both Hansa and Dimvaka have fallen; Kansa also with all<br>his followers has been slain. The time hath, therefore come for the<br>destruction of Jarasandha. He is incapable of being vanquished in battle<br>even by all the celestials and the Asuras (fighting together). We think,<br>however, that he should be vanquished in a personal struggle with bare<br>arms. In me is policy, in Bhima is strength and in Arjuna is triumph; and<br>therefore, as prelude to performing the Rajasuya, we will certainly<br>achieve the destruction of the ruler of Magadha. When we three approach<br>that monarch in secret, and he will, without doubt, be engaged in an<br>encounter with one of us. From fear of disgrace, from covetousness, and<br>from pride of strength he will certainly summon Bhima to the encounter.<br>Like death himself that slays a person however swollen with pride, the<br>long-armed and mighty Bhimasena will effect the destruction of the king.<br>If thou knowest my heart, if thou hast any faith in me, then make over to<br>me, as a pledge, Bhima and Arjuna without loss of time!"<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;Thus addressed by the exalted one,<br>Yudhishthira, beholding both Bhima and Arjuna standing with cheerful<br>faces, replied, saying&#8212;'O Achyuta, O Achyuta, thou slayer of all<br>enemies, say not so. Thou art the lord of the Pandavas! We are dependent<br>on thee. What thou sayest, O Govinda, is consistent with wise counsels.<br>Thou never leadest those upon whom Prosperity hath turned her back. I who<br>stay under thy command regard that Jarasandha is already slain, that the<br>monarchs confined by him have already been set free, that the Rajasuya<br>hath already been accomplished by me. O lord of the universe, O thou best<br>of persons, watchfully act thou so that this task may be accomplished.<br>Without ye then I dare not live, like a sorrowful man afflicted with<br>disease, and bereft of the three attributes of morality, pleasure and<br>wealth. Partha cannot live without Sauri (Krishna), nor can Sauri live<br>without Partha. Nor is there anything in the world that is unconquerable<br>by these two, viz., Krishna and Arjuna. This handsome Bhima also is the<br>foremost of all persons endued with might. Of great renown, what can he<br>not achieve when with ye two? Troops, when properly led, always do<br>excellent service. A force without a leader hath been called inert by the<br>wise. Forces, therefore, should always be led by experienced commanders.<br>Into places that are low, the wise always conduct the water. Even<br>fishermen cause the water (of tank) to run out through holes.<br>(Experienced leaders always lead their forces noting the loopholes and<br>assailable points of the foe). We shall, therefore, strive to accomplish<br>our purpose following the leadership of Govinda conversant with the<br>science of politics, that personage whose fame hath spread all over the<br>world. For the successful accomplishment of one's purposes one should<br>ever place Krishna in the van, that foremost of personages whose strength<br>consists in wisdom and policy and who possesseth a knowledge of both<br>method and means. For the accomplishment of one's purpose let, therefore,<br>Arjuna, the son of Pritha, follow Krishna the foremost of the Yadavas and<br>let Bhima follow Arjuna. Policy and good fortune and might will (then)<br>bring about success in a matter requiring valour.' Vaisampayana<br>said,&#8212;'Thus addressed by Yudhishthira, the trio Krishna, Arjuna and<br>Bhima, all possessed of great energy, set out for Magadha attired in the<br>garb of Snataka Brahmanas of resplendent bodies, and blessed by the<br>agreeable speeches of friends and relatives. Possessed of superior energy<br>and of bodies already like the Sun, the Moon, and the Fire, inflamed with<br>wrath at the sad lot of their relative kings, those bodies of theirs<br>became much more blazing. And the people, beholding Krishna and Arjuna,<br>both of whom had never before been vanquished in battle, with Bhima in<br>the van, all ready to achieve the same task, regarded Jarasandha as<br>already slain. For the illustrious pair (Krishna and Arjuna) were masters<br>that directed every operation (in the universe), as also all acts<br>relating to the morality, wealth, and pleasure of every being. Having set<br>out from the country of the Kurus, they passed through Kuru-jangala and<br>arrived at the charming lake of lotuses. Passing over the hills of<br>Kalakuta, they then went on crossing the Gandaki, the Sadanira<br>(Karatoya), and the Sarkaravarta and the other rivers taking their rise<br>in the same mountains. They then crossed the delightful Sarayu and saw<br>the country of Eastern Kosala. Passing over that country they went to<br>Mithila and then crossing the Mala and Charamanwati, the three heroes<br>crossed the Ganges and the Sone and went on towards the east. At last<br>those heroes of unfaded glory arrived at Magadha in the heart of (the<br>country of) Kushamva. Reaching then the hills of Goratha, they saw the<br>city of Magadha that was always filled with kine and wealth and water and<br>rendered handsome with the innumerable trees standing there.'"
