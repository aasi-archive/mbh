                            Duryodhana said,&#8212;'Come, Kshatta, bring hither Draupadi the dear and<br>loved wife of the Pandavas. Let her sweep the chambers, force her<br>thereto, and let the unfortunate one stay where our serving-women are.'<br><br>"Vidura said,&#8212;'Dost thou not know, O wretch, that by uttering such harsh<br>words thou art tying thyself with cords? Dost thou not understand that<br>thou art hanging on the edge of a precipice? Dost thou not know that<br>being a deer thou provokest so many tigers to rage? Snakes of deadly<br>venom, provoked to ire, are on thy head! Wretch, do not further provoke<br>them lest thou goest to the region of Yama. In my judgement, slavery does<br>not attach to Krishna, in as much as she was staked by the King after he<br>had lost himself and ceased to be his own master. Like the bamboo that<br>beareth fruit only when it is about to die, the son of Dhritarashtra<br>winneth this treasure at play. Intoxicated, he perceiveth nor in these<br>his last moments that dice bring about enmity and frightful terrors. No<br>man should utter harsh speeches and pierce the hearts of the others. No<br>man should subjugate his enemies by dice and such other foul means. No<br>one should utter such words as are disapproved by the Vedas and lead to<br>hell and annoy others. Some one uttereth from his lips words that are<br>harsh. Stung by them another burneth day and night. These words pierce<br>the very heart of another. The learned, therefore, should never utter<br>them, pointing them at others. A goat had once swallowed a hook, and when<br>it was pierced with it, the hunter placing the head of the animal on the<br>ground tore its throat frightfully in drawing it out. Therefore, O<br>Duryodhana, swallow not the wealth of the Pandavas. Make them not thy<br>enemies. The sons of Pritha never use words such as these. It is only low<br>men that are like dogs who use harsh words towards all classes of people,<br>viz., those that have retired to the woods, those leading domestic lives,<br>those employed in ascetic devotions and those that are of great learning.<br>Alas! the son of Dhritarashtra knoweth not that dishonesty is one of the<br>frightful doors of hell. Alas! many of the Kurus with Dussasana amongst<br>them have followed him in the path of dishonesty in the matter of this<br>play at dice. Even gourds may sink and stones may float, and boats also<br>may always sink in water, still this foolish king, the son of<br>Dhritarashtra, listeneth not to my words that are even as regimen unto<br>him. Without doubt, he will be the cause of the destruction of the Kurus.<br>When the words of wisdom spoken by friends and which are even as fit<br>regimen are not listened to, but on the other hand temptation is on the<br>increase, a frightful and universal destruction is sure to overtake all<br>the Kurus."
