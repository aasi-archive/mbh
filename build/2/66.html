                            Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Intoxicated with pride, the son of Dhritarashtra<br>spake,&#8212;'Fie on Kshatta! and casting his eyes upon the Pratikamin in<br>attendance, commanded him, in the midst of all those reverend seniors,<br>saying,&#8212;'Go Pratikamin, and bring thou Draupadi hither. Thou hast no<br>fear from the sons of Pandu. It is Vidura alone that raveth in fear.<br>Besides, he never wisheth our prosperity!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Thus commanded, the Pratikamin, who was of the<br>Suta caste, hearing the words of the king, proceeded with haste, and<br>entering the abode of the Pandavas, like a dog in a lion's den,<br>approached the queen of the sons of Pandu. And he said,&#8212;'Yudhishthira<br>having been intoxicated with dice, Duryodhana, O Draupadi, hath won thee.<br>Come now, therefore, to the abode of Dhritarashtra. I will take thee, O<br>Yajnaseni, and put thee in some menial work.'<br><br>Draupadi said,&#8212;'Why, O Pratikamin, dost thou say so? What prince is<br>there who playeth staking his wife? The king was certainly intoxicated<br>with dice. Else, could he not find any other object to stake?'<br><br>"The Pratikamin said,&#8212;'When he had nothing else to stake, it was then<br>that Ajatasatru, the son of Pandu, staked thee. The king had first staked<br>his brothers, then himself, and then thee, O princess.'<br><br>"Draupadi said,&#8212;'O son of the Suta race, go, and ask that gambler<br>present in the assembly, whom he hath lost first, himself, or me.<br>Ascertaining this, come hither, and then take me with thee, O son of the<br>Suta race.'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"The messenger coming back to the assembly told<br>all present the words of Draupadi. And he spoke unto Yudhishthira sitting<br>in the midst of the kings, these words,&#8212;Draupadi hath asked thee, Whose<br>lord wert thou at the time thou lost me in play? Didst thou lose thyself<br>first or me? Yudhishthira, however sat there like one demented and<br>deprived of reason and gave no answer good or ill to the Suta.<br><br>"Duryodhana then said,&#8212;'Let the princess of Panchala come hither and put<br>her question. Let every one hear in this assembly the words that pass<br>between her and Yudhishthira.'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"The messenger, obedient to the command of<br>Duryodhana, going once again to the palace, himself much distressed, said<br>unto Draupadi,&#8212;'O princess, they that are in the assembly are summoning<br>thee. It seemeth that the end of the Kauravas is at hand. When<br>Duryodhana, O princess, is for taking thee before the assembly, this<br>weak-brained king will no longer be able to protect his prosperity.'<br><br>"Draupadi said,&#8212;'The great ordainer of the world hath, indeed, ordained<br>so. Happiness and misery pay their court to both the wise and unwise.<br>Morality, however, it hath been said, is the one highest object in the<br>world. If cherished, that will certainly dispense blessings to us. Let<br>not that morality now abandon the Kauravas. Going back to those that are<br>present in that assembly, repeat these my words consonant with morality.<br>I am ready to do what those elderly and virtuous persons conversant with<br>morality will definitely tell me.<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"The Suta, hearing these words of Yajnaseni,<br>came back to the assembly and repeated the words of Draupadi. But all sat<br>with faces downwards, uttering not a word, knowing the eagerness and<br>resolution of Dhritarashtra's son.<br><br>"Yudhishthira, however, O bull of the Bharata race, hearing of<br>Duryodhana's intentions, sent a trusted messenger unto Draupadi,<br>directing that although she was attired in one piece of cloth with her<br>navel itself exposed, in consequence of her season having come, she<br>should come before her father-in-law weeping bitterly. And that<br>intelligent messenger, O king, having gone to Draupadi's abode with<br>speed, informed her of the intentions of Yudhishthira. The illustrious<br>Pandavas, meanwhile, distressed and sorrowful, and bound by promise,<br>could not settle what they should do. And casting his eyes upon them,<br>king Duryodhana, glad at heart, addressed the Suta and said,&#8212;'O<br>Pratikamin, bring her hither. Let the Kauravas answer her question before<br>her face. The Suta, then, obedient to his commands, but terrified at the<br>(possible) wrath of the daughter of Drupada, disregarding his reputation<br>for intelligence, once again said to those that were in the<br>assembly,&#8212;what shall I say unto Krishna?'<br><br>"Duryodhana, hearing this, said,&#8212;'O Dussasana, this son of my Suta, of<br>little intelligence, feareth Vrikodara. Therefore, go thou thyself and<br>forcibly bring hither the daughter of Yajnasena, Our enemies at present<br>are dependent on our will. What can they do thee?' Hearing the command of<br>his brother, prince Dussasana rose with blood-red eyes, and entering the<br>abode of those great warriors, spake these words unto the princess,<br>'Come, come, O Krishna, princess of Panchala, thou hast been won by us.<br>And O thou of eyes large as lotus leaves, come now and accept the Kurus<br>for thy lords. Thou hast been won virtuously, come to the assembly.' At<br>these words, Draupadi, rising up in great affliction, rubbed her pale<br>face with her hands, and distressed she ran to the place where the ladies<br>of Dhritarashtra's household were. At this, Dussasana roaring in anger,<br>ran after her and seized the queen by her locks, so long and blue and<br>wavy. Alas! those locks that had been sprinkled with water sanctified<br>with mantras in the great Rajasuya sacrifice, were now forcibly seized by<br>the son of Dhritarashtra disregarding the prowess of the Pandavas. And<br>Dussasana dragging Krishna of long long locks unto the presence of the<br>assembly&#8212;as if she were helpless though having powerful protectors&#8212;and<br>pulling at her, made her tremble like the banana plant in a storm. And<br>dragged by him, with body bent, she faintly cried&#8212;'Wretch! it ill<br>behoveth thee to take me before the assembly. My season hath come, and I<br>am now clad in one piece of attire. But Dussasana dragging Draupadi<br>forcibly by her black locks while she was praying piteously unto Krishna<br>and Vishnu who were Narayana and Nara (on earth), said unto her&#8212;'Whether<br>thy season hath come or not, whether thou art attired in one piece of<br>cloth or entirely naked, when thou hast been won at dice and made our<br>slave, thou art to live amongst our serving-women as thou pleasest."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"With hair dishevelled and half her attire<br>loosened, all the while dragged by Dussasana, the modest Krishna consumed<br>with anger, faintly said&#8212;"In this assembly are persons conversant with<br>all the branches of learning devoted to the performance of sacrifices and<br>other rites, and all equal unto Indra, persons some of whom are really my<br>superiors and others who deserve to be respected as such. I can not stay<br>before them in this state. O wretch! O thou of cruel deeds, drag me not<br>so. Uncover me not so. The princes (my lords) will not pardon thee, even<br>if thou hast the gods themselves with Indra as thy allies. The<br>illustrious son of Dharma is now bound by the obligations of morality.<br>Morality, however, is subtle. Those only that are possessed of great<br>clearness of vision can ascertain it. In speech even I am unwilling to<br>admit an atom of fault in my lord forgetting his virtues. Thou draggest<br>me who am in my season before these Kuru heroes. This is truly an<br>unworthy act. But no one here rebuketh thee. Assuredly, all these are of<br>the same mind with thee. O fie! Truly hath the virtue of the Bharata<br>gone! Truly also hath the usage of those acquainted with the Kshatriya<br>practice disappeared! Else these Kurus in this assembly would never have<br>looked silently on this act that transgresseth the limits of their<br>practices. Oh! both Drona and Bhishma have lost their energy, and so also<br>hath the high-souled Kshatta, and so also this king. Else, why do these<br>foremost of the Kuru elders look silently on this great crime?"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Thus did Krishna of slender waist cry in<br>distress in that assembly. And casting a glance upon her enraged<br>lords&#8212;the Pandavas&#8212;who were filled with terrible wrath, she inflamed<br>them further with that glance of hers. And they were not so distressed at<br>having been robbed of their kingdom, of their wealth, of their costliest<br>gems, as with that glance of Krishna moved by modesty and anger. And<br>Dussasana, beholding Krishna looking at her helpless lords, dragging her<br>still more forcibly, and addressed her, 'Slave, Slave' and laughed aloud.<br>And at those words Karna became very glad and approved of them by<br>laughing aloud. And Sakuni, the son of Suvala, the Gandhara king,<br>similarly applauded Dussasana. And amongst all those that were in the<br>assembly except these three and Duryodhana, every one was filled with<br>sorrow at beholding Krishna thus dragged in sight of that assembly. And<br>beholding it all, Bhishma said, 'O blessed one, morality is subtle. I<br>therefore am unable to duly decide this point that thou hast put,<br>beholding that on the one hand one that hath no wealth cannot stake the<br>wealth belonging to others, while on the other hand wives are always<br>under the orders and at the disposal of their lords. Yudhishthira can<br>abandon the whole world full of wealth, but he will never sacrifice<br>morality. The son of Pandu hath said&#8212;'I am won.' Therefore, I am unable<br>to decide this matter. Sakuni hath not his equal among men at dice-play.<br>The son of Kunti still voluntarily staked with him. The illustrious<br>Yudhishthira doth not himself regard that Sakuni hath played with him<br>deceitfully. Therefore, I can not decide this point."<br><br>"Draupadi said,&#8212;"The king was summoned to this assembly and though<br>possessing no skill at dice, he was made to play with skilful, wicked,<br>deceitful and desperate gamblers. How can he be said then to have staked<br>voluntarily? The chief of the Pandavas was deprived of his senses by<br>wretches of deceitful conduct and unholy instincts, acting together, and<br>then vanquished. He could not understand their tricks, but he hath now<br>done so. Here, in this assembly, there are Kurus who are the lords of<br>both their sons and their daughters-in-law! Let all of them, reflecting<br>well upon my words, duly decide the point that I have put.<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;'Unto Krishna who was thus weeping and crying<br>piteously, looking at times upon her helpless lord, Dussasana spake many<br>disagreeable and harsh words. And beholding her who was then in her<br>season thus dragged, and her upper garments loosened, beholding her in<br>that condition which she little deserved, Vrikodara afflicted beyond<br>endurance, his eyes fixed upon Yudhishthira, gave way to wrath."<br><br>"Bhima said,&#8212;'O Yudhishthira, gamblers have in their houses many women<br>of loose character. They do not yet stake those women having kindness for<br>them even. Whatever wealth and other excellent articles the king of Kasi<br>gave, whatever, gems, animals, wealth, coats of mail and weapons that<br>other kings of the earth gave, our kingdom, thyself and ourselves, have<br>all been won by the foes. At all this my wrath was not excited for thou<br>art our lord. This, however, I regard as a highly improper act&#8212;this act<br>of staking Draupadi. This innocent girl deserveth not this treatment.<br>Having obtained the Pandavas as her lords, it is for thee alone that she<br>is being thus persecuted by the low, despicable, cruel, and mean-minded<br>Kauravas. It is for her sake, O king, that my anger falleth on thee. I<br>shall burn those hands of thine. Sahadeva, bring some fire."<br><br>'Arjuna hearing this, said,&#8212;'Thou hast never, O Bhimasena, before this<br>uttered such words as these. Assuredly thy high morality hath been<br>destroyed by these cruel foes. Thou shouldst not fulfil the wishes of the<br>enemy. Practise thou the highest morality. Whom doth it behave to<br>transgress his virtuous eldest brother? The king was summoned by the foe,<br>and remembering the usage of the Kshatriyas, he played at dice against<br>his will. That is certainly conducive to our great fame.<br><br>'Bhima said,&#8212;'If I had not known, O Dhananjaya, that the king had acted<br>according to Kshatriya usage, then I would have, taking his hands<br>together by sheer force, burnt them in a blazing fire."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Beholding the Pandavas thus distressed and the<br>princess of Panchala also thus afflicted, Vikarna the son of<br>Dhritarashtra said&#8212;'Ye kings, answer ye the question that hath been<br>asked by Yajnaseni. If we do not judge a matter referred to us, all of us<br>will assuredly have to go to hell without delay. How is that Bhishma and<br>Dhritarashtra, both of whom are the oldest of the Kurus, as also the<br>high-souled Vidura, do not say anything! The son of Bharadwaja who is the<br>preceptor of us, as also Kripa, is here. Why do not these best of<br>regenerate ones answer the question? Let also those other kings assembled<br>here from all directions answer according to their judgment this<br>question, leaving aside all motives of gain and anger. Ye kings, answer<br>ye the question that hath been asked by this blessed daughter of king<br>Drupada, and declare after reflection on which side each of ye is.' Thus<br>did Vikarna repeatedly appeal to those that were in that assembly. But<br>those kings answered him not one word, good or ill. And Vikarna having<br>repeatedly appealed to all the kings began to rub his hands and sigh like<br>a snake. And at last the prince said&#8212;'Ye kings of the earth, ye<br>Kauravas, whether ye answer this question or not, I will say what I<br>regard as just and proper. Ye foremost of men, it hath been said that<br>hunting, drinking, gambling, and too much enjoyment of women, are the<br>four vices of kings. The man, that is addicted to these, liveth forsaking<br>virtue. And people do not regard the acts done by a person who is thus<br>improperly engaged, as of any authority. This son of Pandu, while deeply<br>engaged in one of these vicious acts, urged thereto by deceitful<br>gamblers, made Draupadi a stake. The innocent Draupadi is, besides, the<br>common wife of all the sons of Pandu. And the king, having first lost<br>himself offered her as a stake. And Suvala himself desirous of a stake,<br>indeed prevailed upon the king to stake this Krishna. Reflecting upon all<br>these circumstances, I regard Draupadi as not won."<br><br>"Hearing these words, a loud uproar rose from among those present in that<br>assembly. And they all applauded Vikarna and censured the son of Suvala.<br>And at that sound, the son of Radha, deprived of his senses by anger,<br>waving his well-shaped arms, said these words,&#8212;'O Vikarna, many opposite<br>and inconsistent conditions are noticeable in this assembly. Like fire<br>produced from a faggot, consuming the faggot itself, this thy ire will<br>consume thee. These personages here, though urged by Krishna, have not<br>uttered a word. They all regard the daughter of Drupada to have been<br>properly won. Thou alone, O son of Dhritarashtra in consequence of thy<br>immature years, art bursting with wrath, for though but a boy thou<br>speakest in the assembly as if thou wert old. O younger brother of<br>Duryodhana, thou dost not know what morality truly is, for thou sayest<br>like a fool that this Krishna who hath been (justly) won as not won at<br>all. O son of Dhritarashtra, how dost thou regard Krishna as not won,<br>when the eldest of the Pandavas before this assembly staked all his<br>possessions? O bull of the Bharata race, Draupadi is included in all the<br>possessions (of Yudhishthira). Therefore, why regardest thou Krishna who<br>hath been justly won as not won? Draupadi had been mentioned (by Suvala)<br>and approved of as a stake by the Pandavas. For what reason then dost<br>thou yet regard her as not won? Or, if thou thinkest that bringing her<br>hither attired in a single piece of cloth, is an action of impropriety,<br>listen to certain excellent reasons I will give. O son of the Kuru race,<br>the gods have ordained only one husband for one woman. This Draupadi,<br>however, hath many husbands. Therefore, certain it is that she is an<br>unchaste woman. To bring her, therefore, into this assembly attired<br>though she be in one piece of cloth&#8212;even to uncover her is not at all an<br>act that may cause surprise. Whatever wealth the Pandavas had&#8212;she<br>herself and these Pandavas themselves,&#8212;have all been justly won by the<br>son of Suvala. O Dussasana, this Vikarna speaking words of (apparent)<br>wisdom is but a boy. Take off the robes of the Pandavas as also the<br>attire of Draupadi. Hearing these words the Pandavas, O Bharata, took of<br>their upper garments and throwing them down sat in that assembly. Then<br>Dussasana, O king, forcibly seizing Draupadi's attire before the eyes of<br>all, began to drag it off her person."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"When the attire of Draupadi was being thus<br>dragged, the thought of Hari, (And she herself cried aloud, saying), 'O<br>Govinda, O thou who dwellest in Dwaraka, O Krishna, O thou who art fond<br>of cow-herdesses (of Vrindavana). O Kesava, seest thou not that the<br>Kauravas are humiliating me. O Lord, O husband of Lakshmi, O Lord of<br>Vraja (Vrindavana), O destroyer of all afflictions, O Janarddana, rescue<br>me who am sinking in the Kaurava Ocean. O Krishna, O Krishna, O thou<br>great yogin, thou soul of the universe, Thou creator of all things, O<br>Govinda, save me who am distressed,&#8212;who am losing my senses in the midst<br>of the Kurus.' Thus did that afflicted lady resplendent still in her<br>beauty, O king covering her face cried aloud, thinking of Krishna, of<br>Hari, of the lord of the three worlds. Hearing the words of Draupadi,<br>Krishna was deeply moved. And leaving his seat, the benevolent one from<br>compassion, arrived there on foot. And while Yajnaseni was crying aloud<br>to Krishna, also called Vishnu and Hari and Nara for protection, the<br>illustrious Dharma, remaining unseen, covered her with excellent clothes<br>of many hues. And, O monarch as the attire of Draupadi was being dragged,<br>after one was taken off, another of the same kind, appeared covering her.<br>And thus did it continue till many clothes were seen. And, O exalted on,<br>owing to the protection of Dharma, hundreds upon hundreds of robes of<br>many hues came off Draupadi's person. And there arose then a deep uproar<br>of many many voices. And the kings present in that assembly beholding<br>that most extraordinary of all sights in the world, began to applaud<br>Draupadi and censure the son of Dhritarashtra. And Bhima then, squeezing<br>his hands, with lips quivering in rage, swore in the midst of all those<br>kings a terrible oath in a loud voice.<br><br>"And Bhima said,&#8212;Hear these words of mine, ye Kshatriyas of the world.<br>Words such as these were never before uttered by other men, nor will<br>anybody in the future ever utter them. Ye lords of earth, if having<br>spoken these words I do not accomplish them hereafter, let me not obtain<br>the region of my deceased ancestors. Tearing open in battle, by sheer<br>force, the breast of this wretch, this wicked-minded scoundrel of the<br>Bharata race, if I do not drink his life-blood, let me not obtain the<br>region of my ancestors."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Hearing these terrible words of Bhima that made<br>the down of the auditors to stand on end, everybody present there<br>applauded him and censured the son of Dhritarashtra. And when a mass of<br>clothes had been gathered in that assembly, all dragged from the person<br>of Draupadi, Dussasana, tired and ashamed, sat down. And beholding the<br>sons of Kunti in that state, the persons&#8212;those gods among men&#8212;that were<br>in that assembly all uttered the word 'Fie!'(on the son of<br>Dhritarashtra). And the united voices of all became so loud that they<br>made the down of anybody who heard them stand on end. And all the honest<br>men that were in that assembly began to say,&#8212;'Alas! the Kauravas answer<br>not the question that hath been put to them by Draupadi. And all<br>censuring Dhritarashtra together, made a loud clamour. Then Vidura, that<br>master of the science of morality, waving his hands and silencing every<br>one, spake these words;&#8212;'Ye that are in this assembly, Draupadi having<br>put her question is weeping helplessly. Ye are not answering her. Virtue<br>and morality are being persecuted by such conduct. An afflicted person<br>approacheth an assembly of good men, like one that is being consumed by<br>fire. They that are in the assembly quench that fire and cool him by<br>means of truth and morality. The afflicted person asketh the assembly<br>about his rights, as sanctioned by morality. They that are in the<br>assembly should, unmoved by interest and anger, answer the question. Ye<br>kings, Vikarna hath answered the question, according to his own knowledge<br>and judgment. Ye should also answer it as ye think proper. Knowing the<br>rules of morality, and having attended an assembly, he that doth not<br>answer a query that is put, incurreth half the demerit that attacheth to<br>a lie. He, on the other hand, who, knowing the rules of morality and<br>having joined an assembly answereth falsely, assuredly incurreth the sin<br>of a lie. The learned quote as an example in this connection the old<br>history of Prahlada and the son of Angirasa.<br><br>"There was of old a chief of the Daityas of the name Prahlada. He had a<br>son named Virochana. And Virochana, for the sake of obtaining a bride,<br>quarrelled with Sudhanwan, the son of Angiras. It hath been heard by us<br>that they mutually wagered their lives, saying&#8212;I am superior,&#8212;I am<br>superior,&#8212;for the sake of obtaining a bride. And after they had thus<br>quarrelled with each other, they both made Prahlada the arbitrator to<br>decide between them. And they asked him, saying;&#8212;Who amongst us is<br>superior (to the other)? Answer this question. Speak not falsely.<br>Frightened at this quarrel, Prahlada cast his eyes upon Sudhanwan. And<br>Sudhanwan in rage, burning like unto the mace of Yama, told him,&#8212;If thou<br>answerest falsely, or dost not answer at all thy head will then be split<br>into a hundred pieces by the wielder of the thunderbolt with that bolt of<br>his.&#8212;Thus addressed by Sudhanwan, the Daitya, trembling like a leaf of<br>the fig tree, went to Kasyapa of great energy, for taking counsel with<br>him. And Prahlada said,&#8212;'Thou art, O illustrious and exalted one, fully<br>conversant with the rules of morality that should guide both the gods and<br>the Asuras and the Brahmanas as well. Here, however, is a situation of<br>great difficulty in respect of duty. Tell me, I ask thee, what regions<br>are obtainable by them who upon being asked a question, answer it not, or<br>answer it falsely. Kasyapa thus asked answered.&#8212;'He that knoweth, but<br>answereth not a question from temptation, anger or fear, casteth upon<br>himself a thousand nooses of Varuna. And the person who, cited as a<br>witness with respect to any matter of ocular or auricular knowledge,<br>speaketh carelessly, casteth a thousand nooses of Varuna upon his own<br>person. On the completion of one full year, one such noose is loosened.<br>Therefore, he that knoweth, should speak the truth without concealment.<br>If virtue, pierced by sin, repaireth to an assembly (for aid), it is the<br>duty of every body in the assembly to take off the dart, otherwise they<br>themselves would be pierced with it. In an assembly where a truly<br>censurable act is not rebuked, half the demerit of that act attacheth to<br>the head of that assembly, a fourth to the person acting censurably and a<br>fourth unto those others that are there. In that assembly, on the other<br>hand, when he that deserveth censure is rebuked, the head of the assembly<br>becometh freed from all sins, and the other members also incur none. It<br>is only the perpetrator himself of the act that becometh responsible for<br>it. O Prahlada, they who answer falsely those that ask them about<br>morality destroy the meritorious acts of their seven upper and seven<br>lower generations. The grief of one who hath lost all his wealth, of one<br>who hath lost a son, of one who is in debt, of one who is separated from<br>his companions, of a woman who hath lost her husband, of one that hath<br>lost his all in consequence of the king's demand, of a woman who is<br>sterile, of one who hath been devoured by a tiger (during his last<br>struggles in the tiger's claws), of one who is a co-wife, and of one who<br>hath been deprived of his property by false witnesses, have been said by<br>the gods to be uniform in degree. These different sorts of grief are his<br>who speaketh false. A person becometh a witness in consequence of his<br>having seen, heard, and understood a thing. Therefore, a witness should<br>always tell the truth. A truth-telling witness never loseth his religious<br>merits and earthly possessions also.' Hearing these words of Kasyapa,<br>Prahlada told his son, "Sudhanwan is superior to thee, as indeed, (his<br>father) Angiras is superior to me. The mother also of Sudhanwan is<br>superior to thy mother. Therefore, O Virochana, this Sudhanwan is now the<br>lord of the life." At these words of Prahlada, Sudhanwan said, "Since<br>unmoved by affection for thy child, thou hast adhered to virtue, I<br>command, let this son of thine live for a hundred years."<br><br>"Vidura continued,&#8212;Let all the persons, therefore, present in this<br>assembly hearing these high truths of morality, reflect upon what should<br>be the answer to the question asked by Draupadi".<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"The kings that were there hearing these words<br>of Vidura, answered not a word, yet Karna alone spoke unto Dussasana,<br>telling him. Take away this serving-woman Krishna into the inner<br>apartments. And thereupon Dussasana began to drag before all the<br>spectators the helpless and modest Draupadi, trembling and crying<br>piteously unto the Pandavas her lords."
