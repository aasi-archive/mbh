                            Duryodhana said,&#8212;"Those king that are revered over all the world, who<br>are devoted to truth and who are pledged to the observance of rigid vows,<br>who are possessed of great learning and eloquence, who are fully<br>conversant with the Vedas and their branches as also with sacrifices, who<br>have piety and modesty, whose souls are devoted to virtue, who possess<br>fame, and who have enjoyed the grand rites of coronation, all wait upon<br>and worship Yudhishthira. And, O king, I beheld there many thousands of<br>wild kine with as many vessels of white copper for milking them, brought<br>thither by the kings of the earth as sacrificial presents to be given<br>away by Yudhishthira unto the Brahmana. And, O Bharata, for bathing<br>Yudhishthira at the conclusion of the sacrifice, many kings with the<br>greatest alacrity, themselves brought there in a state of purity many<br>excellent jars (containing water). And king Vahlika brought there a car<br>decked with pure gold. And king Sudakshina himself yoked thereto four<br>white horses of Kamboja breed, and Sunitha of great might fitted the<br>lower pole and the ruler of Chedi with his own hands took up and fitted<br>the flag-staff. And the king of the Southern country stood ready with the<br>coat of mail; the ruler of Magadha, with garlands of flowers and the<br>head-gear; the great warrior Vasudana with a sixty years old elephant,<br>the king of Matsya, with the side-fittings of the car, all encased in<br>gold; king Ekalavya, with the shoes; the king of Avanti, with diverse<br>kinds of water for the final bath; king Chekitana, with the quiver; the<br>king of Kasi, with the bow; and Salya; with a sword whose hilt and straps<br>were adorned with gold. Then Dhaumya and Vyasa, of great ascetic merit,<br>with Narada and Asita's son Devala, standing before performed the<br>ceremony of sprinkling the sacred water over the king. And the great<br>Rishis with cheerful hearts sat where the sprinkling ceremony was<br>performed. And other illustrious Rishis conversant with the Vedas, with<br>Jamadagni's son among them, approached Yudhishthira, the giver of large<br>sacrificial presents, uttering mantras all the while, like the seven<br>Rishis, approaching the great India in heaven. And Satyaki of unbaffled<br>prowess held the umbrella (over the king's head). And Dhananjaya and<br>Bhima were engaged in tanning the king; while the twins held a couple of<br>chamaras in their hands. And the Ocean himself brought in a sling that<br>big conch of Varuna which the celestial artificer Viswakarman had<br>constructed with a thousand Nishkas of gold, and which Prajapati had in a<br>former Kalpa, presented unto India. It was with that conch that Krishna<br>bathed Yudhishthira after the conclusion of the sacrifice, and beholding<br>it, I swooned away. People go to the Eastern or the Western seas and also<br>to the Southern one. But, O father, none except birds can ever go to the<br>Northern sea. But the Pandavas have spread their dominion even there, for<br>I heard hundreds of conches that had been brought thence blown (in the<br>sacrificial mansion) indicative of auspicious rejoicing. And while those<br>conches blew simultaneously, my hair stood on end. And those among the<br>kings, who were weak in strength fell down. And Dhrishtadyumna and<br>Satyaki and the sons of Pandu and Kesava,&#8212;those eight, endued with<br>strength and prowess and handsome in person, beholding the kings deprived<br>of consciousness and myself in that plight, laughed outright. Then<br>Vibhatsu (Arjuna) with a cheerful heart gave, O Bharata, unto the<br>principal Brahmanas five hundred bullocks with horns plated with gold.<br>And king Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, having completed the Rajasuya<br>sacrifice, obtained like the exalted Harishchandra such prosperity that<br>neither Rantideva nor Nabhaga, nor Jauvanaswa, nor Manu, nor king Prithu<br>the son of Vena, nor Bhagiratha, Yayati, nor Nahusha, had obtained its<br>like. And beholding, O exalted one, such prosperity, in the son of Pritha<br>which is even like that which Harishchandra had, I do not see the least<br>good in continuing to live, O Bharata! O ruler of men, a yoke that is<br>tied (to the bullock's shoulders) by a blind man becomes loosened. Even<br>such is the case with us. The younger ones are growing while the elder<br>ones are decaying. And beholding all this, O chief of the Kurus, I cannot<br>enjoy peace even with the aid of reflection. And it is for this, O king,<br>that I am plunged into grief and becoming pale and emaciated."
