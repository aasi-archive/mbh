                            "Karna said,&#8212;'Of all the persons in the assembly, three, viz., Bhishma,<br>Vidura, and the preceptor of the Kurus (Drona) appear to be independent;<br>for they always speak of their master as wicked, always censure him, and<br>never wish for his prosperity. O excellent one, the slave, the son, and<br>the wife are always dependent. They cannot earn wealth, for whatever they<br>earn belongeth to their master. Thou art the wife of a slave incapable of<br>possessing anything on his own account. Repair now to the inner<br>apartments of king Dhritarashtra and serve the king's relatives. We<br>direct that that is now thy proper business. And, O princess, all the<br>sons of Dhritarashtra and not the sons of Pritha are now thy masters. O<br>handsome one, select thou another husband now,&#8212;one who will not make<br>thee a slave by gambling. It is well-known that women, especially that<br>are slaves, are not censurable if they proceed with freedom in electing<br>husbands. Therefore let it be done by thee. Nakula hath been won, as also<br>Bhimasena, and Yudhishthira also, and Sahadeva, and Arjuna. And, O<br>Yajnaseni, thou art now a slave. Thy husbands that are slaves cannot<br>continue to be thy lords any longer. Alas, doth not the son of Pritha<br>regards life, prowess and manhood as of no use that he offereth this<br>daughter of Drupada, the king of Panchala, in the presence of all this<br>assembly, as a stake at dice?'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Hearing these words, the wrathful Bhima<br>breathed hard, a very picture of woe. Obedient to the king and bound by<br>the tie of virtue and duty, burning everything with his eyes inflamed by<br>anger, he said,&#8212;'O king, I cannot be angry at these words of this son of<br>a Suta, for we have truly entered the state of servitude. But O king,<br>could our enemies have said so unto me, it thou hadst not played staking<br>this princess?'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Hearing these words of Bhimasena king<br>Duryodhana addressed Yudhishthira who was silent and deprived of his<br>senses, saying,&#8212;'O king, both Bhima and Arjuna, and the twins also, are<br>under thy sway. Answer thou the question (that hath been asked by<br>Draupadi). Say, whether thou regardest Krishna as unwon.' And having<br>spoken thus unto the son of Kunti, Duryodhana. desirous of encouraging<br>the son of Radha and insulting Bhima, quickly uncovered his left thigh<br>that was like unto the stem of a plantain tree or the trunk of an<br>elephant and which was graced with every auspicious sign and endued with<br>the strength of thunder, and showed it to Draupadi in her very sight. And<br>beholding this, Bhimasena expanding his red eyes, said unto Duryodhana in<br>the midst of all those kings and as if piercing them (with his dart-like<br>words),&#8212;'Let not Vrikodara attain to the regions, obtained by his<br>ancestors, if he doth not break that thigh of thine in the great<br>conflict. And sparkles of fire began to be emitted from every organ of<br>sense of Bhima filled with wrath, like those that come out of every crack<br>and orifice in the body of a blazing tree.<br><br>Vidura then, addressing everybody, said,&#8212;'Ye kings of Pratipa's race,<br>behold the great danger that ariseth from Bhimasena. Know ye for certain<br>that this great calamity that threatens to overtake the Bharatas hath<br>been sent by Destiny itself. The sons of Dhritarashtra have, indeed,<br>gambled disregarding every proper consideration. They are even now<br>disputing in this assembly about a lady (of the royal household). The<br>prosperity of our kingdom is at an end. Alas, the Kauravas are even now<br>engaged in sinful consultations. Ye Kauravas, take to your heart this<br>high precept that I declare. If virtue is persecuted, the whole assembly<br>becometh polluted. If Yudhishthira had staked her before he was himself<br>won, he would certainly have been regarded as her master. If, however a<br>person staketh anything at a time when he himself is incapable of holding<br>any wealth, to win it is very like obtaining wealth in a dream. Listening<br>to the words of the king of Gandhara, fall ye not off from this undoubted<br>truth.'<br><br>"Duryodhana, hearing Vidura thus speak, said,&#8212;'I am willing to abide by<br>the words of Bhima, of Arjuna and of the twins. Let them say that<br>Yudhishthira is not their master. Yajnaseni will then be freed from her<br>state of bondage."<br><br>"Arjuna at this, said,&#8212;"This illustrious son of Kunti, king Yudhishthira<br>the just, was certainly our master before he began to play. But having<br>lost himself, let all the Kauravas judge whose master he could be after<br>that."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Just then, a jackal began to cry loudly in the<br>homa-chamber of king Dhritarashtra's palace. And, O king, unto the jackal<br>that howled so, the asses began to bray responsively. And terrible birds<br>also, from all sides, began to answer with their cries. And Vidura<br>conversant with everything and the daughter of Suvala, both understood<br>the meaning of those terrible sounds. And Bhishma and Drona and the<br>learned Gautama loudly cried,&#8212;Swashti! Swashti![1] Then Gandhari and the<br>learned Vidura beholding that frightful omen, represented everything, in<br>great affliction, unto the king. And the king (Dhritarashtra) thereupon<br>said,&#8212;<br><br>'Thou wicked-minded Duryodhana, thou wretch, destruction hath all ready<br>overtaken thee when thou insultest in language such as this the wife of<br>these bulls among the Kurus, especially their wedded wife Draupadi. And<br>having spoken those words, the wise Dhritarashtra endued with knowledge,<br>reflecting with the aid of his wisdom and desirous of saving his<br>relatives and friends from destruction, began to console Krishna, the<br>princess of Panchala, and addressing her, the monarch said,&#8212;'Ask of me<br>any boon, O princess of Panchala, that thou desirest, Chaste and devoted<br>to virtue, thou art the first of all my daughters-in-law.<br><br>"Draupadi said,&#8212;'O bull of the Bharata race, if thou will grant me a<br>boon, I ask the handsome Yudhishthira, obedient to every duty, be freed<br>from slavery. Let not unthinking children call my child Prativindhya<br>endued with great energy of mind as the son of a slave. Having been a<br>prince, so superior to all men, and nurtured by kings it is not proper<br>that he should be called the child of a slave.<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said unto her,&#8212;'O auspicious one, let it be as thou<br>sayest. O excellent one, ask thou another boon, for I will give it. My<br>heart inclineth to give thee a second boon. Thou dost not deserve only<br>one boon.<br><br>"Draupadi said,&#8212;'I ask, O king, that Bhimasena and Dhananjaya and the<br>twins also, with their cars and bows, freed from bondage, regain their<br>liberty.'<br><br>'Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;'O blessed daughter, let it be as thou desirest.<br>Ask thou a third boon, for thou hast not been sufficiently honoured with<br>two boons. Virtuous in thy behaviour, thou art the foremost of all my<br>daughters-in-law.<br><br>Draupadi said,&#8212;'O best of kings, O illustrious one, covetousness always<br>bringeth about loss of virtue. I do not deserve a third boon. Therefore I<br>dare not ask any. O king of kings, it hath been said that a Vaisya may<br>ask one boon; a Kshatriya lady, two boons; a Kshatriya male, three, and a<br>Brahmana, a hundred. O king, these my husbands freed from the wretched<br>state of bondage, will be able to achieve prosperity by their own<br>virtuous acts!'"
