                            "Narada said,&#8212;'Possessed of great splendour, the assembly house of<br>Vaisravana, O king, is a hundred yojanas in length and seventy yojanas in<br>breadth. It was built, O king, by Vaisravana himself using his ascetic<br>power. Possessing the splendour of the peaks of Kailasa, that mansion<br>eclipses by its own the brilliance of the Moon himself. Supported by<br>Guhyakas, that mansion seems to be attached to the firmament. Of<br>celestial make, it is rendered extremely handsome with high chambers of<br>gold. Extremely delightful and rendered fragrant with celestial perfumes,<br>it is variegated with numberless costly jewels. Resembling the peaks of a<br>mass of white clouds, it seems to be floating in the air. Painted with<br>colours of celestial gold, it seems to be decked with streaks of<br>lightning. Within that mansion sitteth on an excellent seat bright as the<br>sun and covered with celestial carpets and furnished with a handsome<br>footstool, king Vaisravana of agreeable person, attired in excellent<br>robes and adorned with costly ornaments and ear-rings of great<br>brilliance, surrounded by his thousand wives. Delicious and cooling<br>breezes murmuring through forests of tall Mandaras, and bearing fragrance<br>of extensive plantations of jasmine, as also of the lotuses on the bosom<br>of the river Alaka and of the Nandana-gardens, always minister to the<br>pleasure of the King of the Yakshas. There the deities with the<br>Gandharvas surrounded by various tribes of Apsaras, sing in chorus, O<br>king, notes of celestial sweetness. Misrakesi and Rambha, and Chitrasena,<br>and Suchismita; and Charunetra, and Gritachi and Menaka, and<br>Punjikasthala; and Viswachi Sahajanya, and Pramlocha and Urvasi and Ira,<br>and Varga and Sauraveyi, and Samichi, and Vududa, and Lata&#8212;these and a<br>thousand other Apsaras and Gandharvas, all well-skilled in music and<br>dance, attend upon Kuvera, the lord of treasures. And that mansion,<br>always filled with the notes of instrumental and vocal music, as also<br>with the sounds of dance of various tribes of Gandharvas, and Apsaras<br>hath become extremely charming and delicious. The Gandharvas called<br>Kinnaras, and others called Naras, and Manibhadra, and Dhanada, and<br>Swetabhadra and Guhyaka; Kaseraka, Gandakandu, and the mighty Pradyota;<br>Kustumvuru, Pisacha, Gajakarna, and Visalaka, Varaha-Karna, Tamraushtica,<br>Falkaksha, and Falodaka; Hansachuda, Sikhavarta, Vibhishana, Pushpanana,<br>Pingalaka, Sonitoda and Pravalaka; Vrikshavaspa-niketa, and<br>Chiravasas&#8212;these O Bharata, and many other Yakshas by hundred and<br>thousands always wait upon Kuvera. The goddess Lakshmi always stayeth<br>there, also Kuvera's son Nalakuvera. Myself and many others like myself<br>often repair thither. Many Brahmana Rishis and celestial Rishis also<br>repair there often. Many Rakshasas, and many Gandharvas, besides those<br>that have been named, wait upon the worship, in that mansion, the<br>illustrious lord of all treasures. And, O tiger among kings, the<br>illustrious husband of Uma and lord of created things, the three-eyed<br>Mahadeva, the wielder of the trident and the slayer of the Asura called<br>Bhaga-netra, the mighty god of the fierce bow, surrounded by multitudes<br>of spirits in their hundreds and thousands, some of dwarfish stature,<br>some of fierce visage, some hunch-backed, some of blood-red eyes, some of<br>frightful yells, some feeding upon fat and flesh, and some terrible to<br>behold, but all armed with various weapons and endued with the speed of<br>wind, with the goddess (Parvati) ever cheerful and knowing no fatigue,<br>always waiteth here upon their friend Kuvera, the lord of treasures. And<br>hundreds of Gandharva chiefs, with cheerful hearts and attired in their<br>respective robes and Viswavasu, and Haha and Huhu; and Tumvuru and<br>Parvatta, and Sailusha; and Chitrasena skilled in music and also<br>Chitraratha,&#8212;these and innumerable Gandharvas worship the lord of<br>treasures. And Chakradhaman, the chief of the Vidyadharas, with his<br>followers, waiteth in that mansion upon the lord of treasures. And<br>Kinnaras by hundreds and innumerable kings with Bhagadatta as their<br>chief, and Druma, the chief of the Kimpurushas, and Mahendra, the chief<br>of the Rakshasas, and Gandhamadana accompanied by many Yakshas and<br>Gandharvas and many Rakshasas wait upon the lord of treasures. The<br>virtuous Vibhishana also worshippeth there his elder brother the lord<br>Kuvera (Croesus). The mountains of Himavat, Paripatra, Vindhya, Kailasa,<br>Mandara, Malaya, Durdura, Mahendra, Gandhamadana, Indrakila, Sunava, and<br>Eastern and the Western hills&#8212;these and many other mountains, in their<br>personified forms, with Meru standing before all, wait upon and worship<br>the illustrious lord of treasures. The illustrious Nandiswaras, and<br>Mahakala, and many spirits with arrowy ears and sharp-pointed mouths,<br>Kaksha, Kuthimukha, Danti, and Vijaya of great ascetic merit, and the<br>mighty white bull of Siva roaring deep, all wait in that mansion. Besides<br>these many other Rakshasas and Pisachas (devils) worship Kuvera in that<br>assembly house. The son of Pulastya (Kuvera) formerly used always to<br>worship in all the modes and sit, with permission obtained, beside the<br>god of gods, Siva, the creator of the three worlds, that supreme Deity<br>surrounded by his attendants. One day the exalted Bhava (Siva) made<br>friendship with Kuvera. From that time, O king, Mahadeva always sitteth<br>on the mansion of his friend, the lord of treasures. Those best of all<br>jewels, those princes of all gems in the three worlds, viz., Sankha and<br>Padma, in their personified forms, accompanied by all the jewels of the<br>earth (also in their personified forms) worship Kuvera."<br><br>"This delightful assembly house of Kuvera that I have seen, attached to<br>the firmament and capable of moving along it, is such, O king. Listen now<br>to the Sabha I describe unto thee, belonging to Brahma the Grandsire."
