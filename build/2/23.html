                            Vaisampayana said,&#8212;'then that foremost of all speakers, Krishna of the<br>Yadava race, addressing king Jarasandha who was resolved upon fighting,<br>said,&#8212;'O king, with whom amongst us three dost thou desire to fight? Who<br>amongst us shall prepare himself for battle (with thee)?' Thus addressed,<br>the ruler of Magadha, king Jarasandha of great splendour, expressed his<br>desire for fighting with Bhima. The priest then, bringing with him the<br>yellow pigment obtained from the cow and garlands of flowers and other<br>auspicious articles, as also various excellent medicines for restoring<br>lost consciousness and alleviating pain, approached Jarasandha, panting<br>for battle. The king Jarasandha, on whose behalf propitiatory ceremonies<br>with benedictions were performed by a renowned Brahmana, remembering the<br>duty of a Kshatriya dressed himself for battle. Taking off his crown and<br>binding his hair properly, Jarasandha stood up like an ocean bursting its<br>continents. Then the monarch possessed of terrible prowess, addressing<br>Bhima. said, 'I will fight with thee. It is better to be vanquished by a<br>superior person.' And saying this, Jarasandha, that represser of all foes<br>endued, rushed with great energy at Bhimasena like the Asura Vala or old<br>who rushed at the chief of the celestials. And the mighty Bhimasena, on<br>whose behalf the gods had been invoked by Krishna, that cousin of his,<br>having consulted with advanced towards Jarasandha, impelled by the desire<br>of fight. Then those tigers among men, those heroes of great prowess,<br>with their bare arms as their only weapons, cheerfully engaged themselves<br>in the encounter, each desirous of vanquishing the other. And seizing<br>each other's arms and twining each other's legs, (at times) they slapped<br>their arm-pits, causing the enclosure to tremble at the sound. And<br>frequently seizing each other's necks with their hands and dragging and<br>pushing it with violence, and each pressing every limb of his body<br>against every limb of the other, they continued, O exalted one, to slap<br>their arm-pits (at time). And sometimes stretching their arms and<br>sometimes drawing them close, and now raising them up and now dropping<br>them down, they began to seize each other. And striking neck against neck<br>and forehead against forehead, they caused fiery sparks to come out like<br>flashes of lightning. And grasping each other in various ways by means of<br>their arms, and kicking each other with such violence as to affect the<br>innermost nerves, they struck at each other's breasts with clenched<br>fists. With bare arms as their only weapons roaring like clouds they<br>grasped and struck each other like two mad elephants encountering each<br>other with their trunks. Incensed at each other's blow, they fought on<br>dragging and pushing each other and fiercely looking at each other like<br>two wrathful lions. And each striking every limb of the other with his<br>own and using his arms also against the other, and catching hold of each<br>other's waist, they hurled each other to a distance. Accomplished in<br>wrestling, the two heroes clasping each other with their arms and each<br>dragging the other unto himself, began to press each other with great<br>violence. The heroes then performed those grandest of all feats in<br>wrestling called Prishtabhanga, which consisted in throwing each other<br>down with face towards the earth and maintaining the one knocked down in<br>that position as long as possible. And employing his arms, each also<br>performed the feats called Sampurna-murchcha and Purna-kumbha. At times<br>they twisted each other's arms and other limbs as if these were vegetable<br>fibres that were to be twisted into chords. And with clenched fists they<br>struck each other at times, pretending to aim at particular limbs while<br>the blows descended upon other parts of the body. It was thus that those<br>heroes fought with each other. The citizens consisting of thousands, of<br>Brahmanas, Kshatriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras, and even women and the<br>aged, O tiger among men, came out and gathered there to behold the fight.<br>And the crowd became so great that it was one solid mass of humanity with<br>no space between body and body. The sound the wrestlers made by the<br>slapping of their arms, the seizing of each other's necks for bringing<br>each other down, and the grasping of each other's legs for dashing each<br>other to the ground, became so loud that it resembled the roar of thunder<br>or of falling cliffs. Both of them were foremost of mighty men, and both<br>took great delight in such encounter. Desirous of vanquishing the other,<br>each was on the alert for taking advantage of the slightest lapse of the<br>other. And, O monarch, the mighty Bhima and Jarasandha fought terribly on<br>in those lists, driving the crowd at times by the motions of their hands<br>like Vritra and Vasava of old. Thus two heroes, dragging each other<br>forward and pressing each other backward and with sudden jerks throwing<br>each other face downward and sideways, mangled each other dreadfully. And<br>at times they struck each other with their knee-joints. And addressing<br>each other loudly in stinging speeches, they struck each other with<br>clenched fists, the blows descending like a mass of stone upon each<br>other. With broad shoulders and long arms and both well-skilled in<br>wrestling encounters, they struck each other with those long arms of<br>theirs that were like maces of iron. That encounter of the heroes<br>commenced on the first (lunar) day of the month of Kartic (October) and<br>the illustrious heroes fought on without intermission and food, day and<br>night, till the thirteenth lunar day. It was on the night of the<br>fourteenth of the lunar fortnight that the monarch of Magadha desisted<br>from fatigue. And O king, Janardana beholding the monarch tired,<br>addressed Bhima of terrible deeds, and as if to stimulate him said,&#8212;'O<br>son of Kunti, a foe that is fatigued cannot be pressed for if pressed at<br>such a time he may even die. Therefore, O son of Kunti, this king should<br>not be oppressed by thee. On the other hand, O bull of the Bharata race,<br>fight with him With thy arms, putting forth as much strength only as thy<br>antagonist hath now left!' Then that slayer of hostile heroes, the son of<br>Pandu, thus addressed by Krishna, understood the plight of Jarasandha and<br>forthwith resolved upon taking his life. And that foremost of all men<br>endued with strength, that prince of the Kuru race, desirous of<br>vanquishing the hitherto unvanquished Jarasandha, mustered all his<br>strength and courage."
