                            "Vaisampayana said,&#8212;Hearing these words of Bhishma, the ruler of Chedi<br>endued with exceeding prowess, desirous of combating with Vasudeva<br>addressed him and said,&#8212;O Janarddana, I challenge thee. Come, fight with<br>me until I slay thee today with all the Pandavas. For, O Krishna, the<br>sons of Pandu also, who disregarding the claims of all these kings, have<br>worshipped thee who art no king, deserve to be slain by me along with<br>thee. Even this is my opinion, O Krishna, that they who from childishness<br>have worshipped thee, as if thou deservest it, although thou art unworthy<br>of worship, being only a slave and a wretch and no king, deserve to be<br>slain by me.' Having said this, that tiger among kings stood there<br>roaring in anger. And after Sisupala had ceased, Krishna addressing all<br>the kings in the presence of the Pandavas, spoke these words in a soft<br>voice.&#8212;'Ye kings, this wicked-minded one, who is the son of a daughter<br>of the Satwata race, is a great enemy of us of the Satwata race; and<br>though we never seek to injure him, he ever seeketh our evil. This wretch<br>of cruel deeds, ye kings, hearing that we had gone to the city of<br>Pragjyotisha, came and burnt Dwaraka, although he is the son of my<br>father's sister. While king Bhoja was sporting on the Raivataka hill,<br>this one fell upon the attendants of that king and slew and led away many<br>of them in chains to his own city. Sinful in all his purpose, this<br>wretch, in order to obstruct the sacrifice of my father, stole the<br>sacrificial horse of the horse-sacrifice that had been let loose under<br>the guard of armed men. Prompted by sinful motives, this one ravished the<br>reluctant wife of the innocent Vabhru (Akrura) on her way from Dwaraka to<br>the country of the Sauviras. This injurer of his maternal uncle,<br>disguising himself in the attire of the king of Karusha, ravished also<br>the innocent Bhadra, the princess of Visala, the intended bride of king<br>Karusha. I have patiently borne all these sorrows for the sake of my<br>father's sister. It is, however, very fortunate that all this hath<br>occurred today in the presence of all the kings. Behold ye all today the<br>hostility this one beareth towards me. And know ye also all that he hath<br>done me at my back. For the excess of that pride in which he hath<br>indulged in the presence of all these monarchs, he deserveth to be slain<br>by me. I am ill able to pardon today the injuries that he hath done me.<br>Desirous of speedy death, this fool had desired Rukmini. But the fool<br>obtained her not, like a Sudra failing to obtain the audition of the<br>Vedas."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Hearing these words of Vasudeva, all the<br>assembled monarchs began to reprove the ruler of Chedi. But the powerful<br>Sisupala, having heard these words, laughed aloud and spoke thus,&#8212;'O<br>Krishna, art thou not ashamed in saying in this assembly, especially<br>before all these kings that Rukmini (thy wife) had been coveted by me? O<br>slayer of Madhu, who else is there than thee, who regarding himself a man<br>would say in the midst of respectable men that his wife had been intended<br>for some body else? O Krishna, pardon me if thou pleasest, or pardon me<br>not. But angry or friendly, what canst thou do unto me?'<br><br>"And while Sisupala was speaking thus, the exalted slayer of Madhu<br>thought in his mind of the discus that humbleth the pride of the Asuras.<br>And as soon as the discus came into his hands, skilled in speech the<br>illustrious one loudly uttered these words,&#8212;'Listen ye lords of earth,<br>why this one had hitherto been pardoned by me. As asked by his mother, a<br>hundred offences (of his) were to be pardoned by me. Even this was the<br>boon she had asked, and even this I granted her. That number, ye kings,<br>hath become full. I shall now slay him in your presence, ye monarchs.'<br>Having said this, the chief of the Yadus, that slayer of all foes, in<br>anger, instantly cut off the head of the ruler of Chedi by means of his<br>discus. And the mighty-armed one fell down like a cliff struck with<br>thunder. And, O monarch, the assembled kings then beheld a fierce energy,<br>like unto the sun in the sky, issue out of the body of the king of Chedi,<br>and O king, that energy then adored Krishna, possessed of eyes like lotus<br>leaves and worshipped by all the worlds, and entered his body. And all<br>the kings beholding the energy which entered that mighty-armed chief of<br>men regarded it as wonderful. And when Krishna had slain the king of<br>Chedi, the sky, though cloudless, poured showers of rain, and blasting<br>thunders were hurled, and the earth itself began to tremble. There were<br>some among the kings who spoke not a word during those unspeakable<br>moments but merely sat gazing at Janarddana. And some there were that<br>rubbed in rage their palms with their forefingers. And there were others<br>who deprived of reason by rage bit their lips with their teeth. And some<br>amongst the kings applauded him of the Vrishni race in private. And some<br>there were that became excited with anger; while others became mediators.<br>The great Rishis with pleased hearts praised Kesava and went away. And<br>all the high-souled Brahmanas and the mighty kings that were there,<br>beholding Krishna's prowess, became glad at heart and praised him.<br><br>"Yudhishthira then commanded his brothers to perform without delay the<br>funeral rites of king Sisupala, the brave son of Damaghosha, with proper<br>respect. The sons of Pandu obeyed the behest of their brother. And<br>Yudhishthira then, with all the kings, installed the son of king Sisupala<br>in the sovereignty of the Chedis.<br><br>"Then that sacrifice, O monarch, of the king of the Kurus possessed of<br>great energy, blessed with every kind of prosperity, became exceedingly<br>handsome and pleasing unto all young men. And commenced auspiciously, and<br>all impediments removed, and furnished with abundance of wealth and corn,<br>as also with plenty of rice and every kind of food, it was properly<br>watched by Kesava. And Yudhishthira in due time completed the great<br>sacrifice. And the mighty-armed Janarddana, the exalted Sauri, with his<br>bow called Saranga and his discus and mace, guarded that sacrifice till<br>its completion. And all the Kshatriya monarchs, having approached the<br>virtuous Yudhishthira who had bathed after the conclusion of the<br>sacrifice, said these words: 'By good fortune thou hast come out<br>successful. O virtuous one, thou hast obtained the imperial dignity. O<br>thou of the Ajamida race, by thee hath been spread the fame of thy whole<br>race. And, O king of kings, by this act of thine, thou hast also acquired<br>great religious merit. We have been worshipped by thee to the full extent<br>of our desires. We now tell thee that we are desirous of returning to our<br>own kingdoms. It behoveth thee to grant us permission.'<br><br>"Hearing these words of the monarchs, king Yudhishthira the just,<br>worshipping each as he deserved, commanded his brothers, saying, 'These<br>monarchs had all come to us at their own pleasure. These chastisers of<br>foes are now desirous of returning to their own kingdoms, bidding me<br>farewell. Blest be ye, follow ye these excellent kings to the confines of<br>our own dominions.' Hearing these words of their brother, the virtuous<br>Pandava princes followed the kings, one after another as each deserved.<br>The powerful Dhrishtadyumna followed without loss of time king Virata:<br>and Dhananjaya followed the illustrious and mighty charioteer Yajnasena;<br>and the mighty Bhimasena followed Bhishma and Dhritarashtra: and<br>Sahadeva, that master of battle, followed the brave Drona and his son;<br>and Nakula, O king, followed Suvala with his son; and the sons of<br>Draupadi with the son of Subhadra followed those mighty warriors&#8212;the<br>kings of the mountainous countries. And other bulls among Kshatriyas<br>followed other Kshatriyas. And the Brahmanas by thousands also went away,<br>duly worshipped.<br><br>"After all the Kings and the Brahmanas had gone away, the powerful<br>Vasudeva addressing Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'O son of the Kuru race, with thy<br>leave, I also desire to go to Dwaraka. By great good fortune, thou hast<br>accomplished the foremost of sacrifices&#8212;Rajasuya!' Thus addressed by<br>Janarddana, Yudhishthira replied, 'Owing to thy grace, O Govinda. I have<br>accomplished the great sacrifice. And it is owing to thy grace that the<br>whole Kshatriya world having accepted my sway, had come hither with<br>valuable tribute. O hero, without thee, my heart never feeleth any<br>delight. How can I, therefore, O hero, give thee, O sinless one, leave to<br>go? But thou must have to go to the city of Dwaraka.' The virtuous Hari<br>of worldwide fame, thus addressed by Yudhishthira, cheerfully went with<br>his cousin to Pritha and said,&#8212;'O aunt, thy sons have now obtained the<br>imperial dignity. They have obtained vast wealth and been also crowned<br>with success. Be pleased with all this. Commanded by thee, O aunt, I<br>desire to go to Dwaraka.' After this, Kesava bade farewell to Draupadi<br>and Subhadra. Coming out then of the inner apartments accompanied by<br>Yudhishthira, he performed his ablutions and went through the daily rites<br>of worship, and then made the Brahmanas utter benedictions. Then the<br>mighty armed Daruka came there with a car of excellent design and body<br>resembling the clouds. And beholding that Garuda-bannered car arrived<br>thither, the high-souled one, with eyes like lotus leaves, walked round<br>it respectfully and ascending on it set out for Dwaravati. And king<br>Yudhishthira the just, blessed with prosperity, accompanied by his<br>brothers, followed on foot the mighty Vasudeva. Then Hari with eyes like<br>lotus leaves, stopping that best of cars for a moment, addressing<br>Yudhishthira the son of Kunti, said,&#8212;'O king of kings, cherishest thou<br>thy subjects with ceaseless vigilance and patience. And as the clouds are<br>unto all creatures, as the large tree of spreading bough is unto birds,<br>as he of a thousand eyes is unto the immortals, be thou the refuge and<br>support of thy relatives. And Krishna and Yudhishthira having thus talked<br>unto each other took each other's leave and returned to their respective<br>homes. And, O king, after the chief of the Satwata race had gone to<br>Dwaravati, king Duryodhana alone, with king Suvala's son, Sakuni,&#8212;these<br>bulls among men,&#8212;continued to live in that celestial assembly house.
