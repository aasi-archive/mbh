                            Janamejaya said,&#8212;"How did the sons of Dhritarashtra feel, when they came<br>to know that the Pandavas had, with Dhritarashtra's leave, left<br>Hastinapore with all their wealth and jewels?"<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"O king, learning that the Pandavas had been<br>commanded by the wise Dhritarashtra to return to their capital, Dussasana<br>went without loss of time unto his brother. And, O bull of the Bharata<br>race, having arrived before Duryodhana with his counsellor, the prince,<br>afflicted with grief, began to say,&#8212;'Ye mighty warriors, that which we<br>had won after so much trouble, the old man (our father) hath thrown away.<br>Know ye that he hath made over the whole of that wealth to the foes. At<br>these words, Duryodhana and Karna and Sakuni, the son of Suvala, all of<br>whom were guided by vanity, united together, and desirous of<br>counteracting the sons of Pandu, approaching in haste saw privately the<br>wise king Dhritarashtra&#8212;the son of Vichitravirya and spake unto him<br>these pleasing and artful words. Duryodhana said,&#8212;<br><br>'Hast thou not heard, O king, what the learned Vrihaspati the preceptor<br>of the celestials, said in course of counselling Sakra about mortals and<br>politics? Even these, O slayer of foes, were the words of Vrihaspati,<br>'Those enemies that always do wrong by stratagem or force, should be<br>slain by every means.' If, therefore, with the wealth of the Pandavas, we<br>gratify the kings of the earth and then fight with the sons of Pandu,<br>what reverses can overtake us? When one hath placed on the neck and back<br>of venomous snakes full of wrath for encompassing his destruction, is it<br>possible for him to take them off? Equipped with weapon and seated on<br>their cars, the angry sons of Pandu like wrathful and venomous snakes<br>will assuredly annihilate us, O father. Even now Arjuna proceedeth,<br>encased in mail and furnished with his couple of quivers, frequently<br>taking up the Gandiva and breathing hard and casting angry glances<br>around. It hath (also) been heard by us that Vrikodara, hastily ordering<br>his car to be made ready and riding on it, is proceeding along,<br>frequently whirling his heavy mace. Nakula also is going along, with the<br>sword in his grasp and the semi-circular shield in his hand. And Sahadeva<br>and the king (Yudhishthira) have made signs clearly testifying to their<br>intentions. Having ascended their cars that are full of all kinds of<br>arms, they are whipping their horses (for going to Khandava soon) and<br>assembling their forces. Persecuted thus by us they are incapable of<br>forgiving us those injuries. Who is there among them that will forgive<br>that insult to Draupadi? Blest be thou. We will again gamble with the son<br>of Pandu for sending them to exile. O bull among men, we are competent to<br>bring them thus under our sway. Dressed in skins, either we or they<br>defeated at dice, shall repair to the woods for twelve years. The<br>thirteenth year shall have to be spent in some inhabited country<br>unrecognised; and, if recognised, an exile for another twelve years shall<br>be the consequence. Either we or they shall live so. Let the play begin,<br>casting the dice, let the sons of Pandu once more play. O bull of the<br>Bharata race, O king, even this is our highest duty. This Sakuni knoweth<br>well the whole science of dice. Even if they succeed in observing this<br>vow for thirteen years, we shall be in the meantime firmly rooted in the<br>kingdom and making alliances, assemble a vast invincible host and keep<br>them content, so that we shall, O king, defeat the sons of Pandu if they<br>reappear. Let this plan recommend itself to thee, O slayer of foes.<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;Bring back the Pandavas then, indeed, even if they<br>have gone a great way. Let them come at once again to cast dice."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Then Drona, Somadatta and Valhika, Gautama,<br>Vidura, the son of Drona, and the mighty son of Dhritarashtra by his<br>Vaisya wife, Bhurisravas, and Bhishma, and that mighty warrior<br>Vikarna,&#8212;all said, 'Let not the play commence. Let there be peace. But<br>Dhritarashtra, partial to his sons, disregarding the counsels of all his<br>wise friends and relatives, summoned the sons of Pandu."
