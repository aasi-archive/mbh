                            "Duryodhana said,&#8212;'He that is devoid of intellect but hath merely heard<br>of many things, can scarcely understand the real import of the<br>scriptures, like the spoon that hath no perception of the taste of the<br>soup it toucheth. Thou knowest everything, but yet confoundest me. Like a<br>boat fastened to another, thou and I are tied to each other. Art thou<br>unmindful of thy own interests? Or, dost thou entertain hostile feeling<br>towards me? These thy sons and allies are doomed to destruction, inasmuch<br>as they have thee for their ruler, for thou describest as attainable in<br>the future what is to be done at the present moment. He often trippeth<br>whose guide acts under the instructions of others. How then can his<br>followers expect to come across a right path? O king, thou art of mature<br>wisdom; thou hast the opportunity to listen to the words of old, and thy<br>senses also are under thy control. It behoveth thee not to confound us<br>who are ready to seek our own interests. Vrihaspati hath said that the<br>usage of kings are different from those of common people. Therefore kings<br>should always attend to their own interests with vigilance. The<br>attainment of success is the sole criterion that should guide the conduct<br>of a Kshatriya. Whether, therefore, the means is virtuous or sinful, what<br>scruples can there be in the duties of one's own order? He that is<br>desirous of snatching the blazing prosperity of his foe, should, O bull<br>of the Bharata race, bring every direction under his subjection like the<br>charioteer taming the steeds with his whip. Those used to handling<br>weapons say that, a weapon is not simply an instrument that cuts but is a<br>means, whether covert or overt, that can defeat a foe. Who is to be<br>reckoned a foe and who a friend, doth not depend on one's figure or<br>dimensions. He that paineth another is, O king, to be regarded a foe by<br>him that is pained. Discontent is the root of prosperity. Therefore, O<br>king, I desire to be discontented. He that striveth after the acquisition<br>of prosperity is, O king, a truly politic person. Nobody should be<br>attached to wealth and affluence, for the wealth that hath been earned<br>and hoarded may be plundered. The usages of kings are even such. It was<br>during a period of peace that Sakra cut off the head of Namuchi after<br>having given a pledge to the contrary, and it was because he approved of<br>this eternal usage towards the enemy that he did so. Like a snake that<br>swalloweth up frogs and other creatures living in holes, the earth<br>swalloweth up a king that is peaceful and a Brahmana that stirreth not<br>out of home. O king, none can by nature be any person's foe. He is one's<br>foe, and not anybody else, who hath common pursuits with one. He that<br>from folly neglecteth a growing foe, hath his vitals cut off as by a<br>disease that he cherished without treatment. A foe, however<br>insignificant, if suffered to grow in prowess, swalloweth one like the<br>white ants at the root of a tree eating off the tree itself. O Bharata, O<br>Ajamida, let not the prosperity of the foe be acceptable to thee. This<br>policy (of neglecting the foe) should always be borne on their heads by<br>the wise even like a load. He that always wisheth for the increase of his<br>wealth, ever groweth in the midst of his relatives even like the body<br>naturally growing from the moment of birth. Prowess conferreth speedy<br>growth. Coveting as I do the prosperity of the Pandavas. I have not yet<br>made it my own. At present I am a prey to doubts in respect of my<br>ability. I am determined to resolve those doubts of mine. I will either<br>obtain that prosperity of theirs, or lie down having perished in battle.<br>O king when the state of my mind is such, what do I care now for life,<br>for the Pandavas are daily growing while our possessions know no<br>increase?'"
