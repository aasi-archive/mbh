                            "Vasudeva said,&#8212;'Arjuna hath indicated what the inclination should be of<br>one that is born in the Bharata race, especially of one who is the son of<br>Kunti. We know not when death will overtake us, in the night or in the<br>day. Nor have we ever heard that immortality hath been achieved by<br>desisting from fight. This, therefore, is the duty of men, viz., to<br>attack all enemies in accordance with the principles laid down in the<br>ordinance. This always gives satisfaction to the heart. Aided by good<br>policy, if not frustrated by Destiny, an undertaking becomes crowned with<br>success. If both parties aided by such means encounter each other, one<br>must obtain ascendency over the other, for both cannot win or lose. A<br>battle however, if directed by bad policy which again is destitute of the<br>well-known arts, ends in defeat or destruction. If, again, both parties<br>are equally circumstanced, the result becomes doubtful. Both, however,<br>cannot win. When such is the case, why should we not, aided by good<br>policy, directly approach the foe; and destroy him, like the current of<br>the river uprooting a tree? If, disguising our own faults, we attack the<br>enemy taking advantage of his loopholes, why should we not succeed?<br>Indeed, the policy of intelligent men, is that one should not fight<br>openly with foes that are exceedingly powerful and are at the head of<br>their well-arrayed forces. This too is my opinion. If, however, we<br>accomplish our purpose secretly entering the abode of our foe and<br>attacking his person, we shall never earn obloquy. That bull among<br>men&#8212;Jarasandha&#8212;alone enjoyeth unfaded glory, like unto him who is the<br>self in the heart of every created being. But I see his destruction<br>before me. Desirous of protecting our relatives we will either slay him<br>in battle or shall ascend to heaven being ourselves slain in the end by<br>him.'<br><br>Yudhishthira said&#8212;"O Krishna, who is this Jarasandha? What is his energy<br>and what is his prowess, that having touched thee he hath not been burnt<br>like an insect at the touch of fire?"<br><br>Krishna said,&#8212;'Hear, O monarch, who Jarasandha is; what his energy; and<br>what is his prowess; and why also he hath been spared by us, Even though<br>he hath repeatedly offended us. There was a mighty king of the name of<br>Vrihadratha, the lord of the Magadhas. Proud in battle, he had three<br>Akshauhinis of troops. Handsome and endued with energy, possessed of<br>affluence and prowess beyond measure, and always bearing on his person<br>marks indicating installation at sacrifices. He was like a second Indra.<br>In glory he was like unto Suryya, in forgiveness like unto the Earth, in<br>wrath like unto the destroyer Yama and in wealth like unto Vaisravana.<br>And O thou foremost of the Bharata race, the whole earth was covered by<br>his qualities that descended upon him from a long line of ancestors, like<br>the rays emerging from the sun. And, O bull of the Bharata race, endued<br>with great energy that monarch married two twin daughters of the king of<br>Kasi, both endued with the wealth of beauty. And that bull among men made<br>an engagement in secret with his wives that he would love them equally<br>and would never show a preference for either. And the lord of the earth<br>in the company of his two dearly loved wives, both of whom suited him<br>well, passed his days in joy like a mighty elephant in the company of two<br>cow-elephants, or like the ocean in his personified form between Ganga<br>and Yamuna (also in their personified forms). The monarch's youth<br>however, passed away in the enjoyment of his possessions, without any son<br>being born unto him to perpetuate his line. The best of monarch failed to<br>obtain a son to perpetuate his race, even by means of various auspicious<br>rites, and homas, and sacrifices performed with the desire for having an<br>offspring. One day the king heard that the high-souled Chanda-kausika,<br>the son of Kakshivat of the illustrious Gautama race, having desisted<br>from ascetic penances had come in course of his wanderings to his capital<br>and had taken his seat under the shade of a mango tree. The king went<br>unto that Muni accompanied by his two wives, and worshipping him with<br>jewels and valuable presents gratified him highly. That best of Rishis<br>truthful in speech and firmly attached to truth, then told the king,&#8212;O<br>king of kings, I have been pleased with thee. O thou of excellent vows,<br>solicit thou a boon. King Vrihadratha then, with his wives, bending low<br>unto that Rishi, spoke these words choked with tears in consequence of<br>his despair of obtaining a child.&#8212;'O holy one forsaking my kingdom I am<br>about to go into the woods to practise ascetic penances. I am very<br>unfortunate for I have no son. What shall I do, therefore, with my<br>kingdom or with a boon?'<br><br>Krishna continued,&#8212;"Hearing these words (of the king), the Muni<br>controlling his outer senses entered into meditation, sitting in the<br>shade of that very mango tree where he was. And there fell upon the lap<br>of the seated Muni a mango that was juicy and untouched by the beak of a<br>parrot or any other bird. That best of Munis, taking up the fruit and<br>mentally pronouncing certain mantras over it, gave it unto the king as<br>the means of his obtaining an incomparable offspring. And the great Muni,<br>possessed also of extraordinary wisdom, addressing the monarch,<br>said,&#8212;"Return, O king, thy wish is fulfilled. Desist, O king, from going<br>(into the woods)".&#8212;Hearing these words of the Muni and worshipping his<br>feet, the monarch possessed of great wisdom, returned to his own abode.<br>And recollecting his former promise (unto them) the king gave, O bull of<br>the Bharata race, unto his two wives that one fruit. His beautiful<br>queens, dividing that single fruit into two parts, ate it up. In<br>consequence of the certainty of the realisation of the Muni's words and<br>his truthfulness, both of them conceived, as an effect of their having<br>eaten that fruit. And the king beholding them in that state became filled<br>with great joy. Then, O wise monarch, some time after, when the time<br>came, each of the queens brought forth a fragmentary body. And each<br>fragment had one eye, one arm, one leg, half a stomach, half a face, and<br>half an anus. Beholding the fragmentary bodies, both the mothers trembled<br>much. The helpless sisters then anxiously consulted each other, and<br>sorrowfully abandoned those fragments endued with life. The two midwives<br>(that waited upon the queens) then carefully wrapping up the still-born<br>(?) fragments went out of the inner apartments (of the palace) by the<br>back door and throwing away the bodies, returned in haste. A little while<br>after, O tiger among men, a Rakshasa woman of the name of Jara living<br>upon flesh and blood, took up the fragments that lay on a crossing. And<br>impelled by force of fate, the female cannibal united the fragments for<br>facility of carrying them away. And, O bull among men, as soon as the<br>fragments were united they formed a sturdy child of one body (endued with<br>life). Then, O king, the female cannibal, with eyes expanded in wonder,<br>found herself unable to carry away that child having a body as hard and<br>strong as the thunder-bolt. That infant then closing his fists red as<br>copper and inserting them into its mouth, began to roar terribly as<br>rain-charged clouds. Alarmed at the sound, the inmates of the palace, O<br>tiger among men, suddenly came out with the king, O slayer of all foes.<br>The helpless and disappointed and sad queens also, with breasts full of<br>milk, also came out suddenly to recover their child. The female cannibal<br>beholding the queens in that condition and the king too so desirous of an<br>offspring, and the child was possessed of such strength thought within<br>herself&#8212;I live within dominions of the king who is so desirous of an<br>offspring. It behoveth not me, therefore, to kill the infant child of<br>such an illustrious and virtuous monarch. The Rakshasa woman then,<br>holding the child in her arms like the clouds enveloping the sun, and<br>assuming a human form, told the king these words,&#8212;O Vrihadratha, this is<br>thy child. Given to thee by me, O, take it. It hath been born of both thy<br>wives by virtue of the command of the great Brahmana. Cast away by the<br>midwives, it hath been protected by me!<br><br>"Krishna continued,&#8212;O thou foremost of the Bharata race, the handsome<br>daughters of the king of Kasi, having obtained the child, soon drenched<br>it with their lacteal streams. The king ascertaining everything, was<br>filled with joy, and addressing that female cannibal disguised as a human<br>being possessing the complexion of gold, asked,&#8212;O thou of the complexion<br>of the filament of the lotus, who art thou that givest me this child? O<br>auspicious one, thou seemest to me as a goddess roaming at thy pleasure!"
