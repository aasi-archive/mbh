                            'Narada said&#8212;O Yudhishthira, the celestial Sabha of Varuna is<br>unparalleled in splendour. In dimensions it is similar to that of Yama.<br>Its walls and arches are all of pure white. It hath been built by<br>Viswakarma (the celestial architect) within the waters. It is surrounded<br>on all sides by many celestial trees made of gems and jewels and yielding<br>excellent fruits and flowers. And many plants with their weight of<br>blossoms, blue and yellow, and black and darkish, and white and red, that<br>stand there, or excellent bowers around. Within those bowers hundreds and<br>thousands of birds of diverse species, beautiful and variegated, always<br>pour forth their melodies. The atmosphere of that mansion is extremely<br>delightful, neither cold nor hot. Owned by Varuna, that delightful<br>assembly house of pure white consists of many rooms and is furnished with<br>many seats. There sitteth Varuna attired in celestial robe, decked in<br>celestial ornaments and jewels, with his queen, adorned with celestial<br>scents and besmeared with paste of celestial fragrance. The Adityas wait<br>upon and worship the illustrious Varuna, the lord of the waters. And<br>Vasuki and Takshaka, and the Naga called Airavana; Krishna and Lohita;<br>Padma and Chitra endued with great energy; the Nagas called Kamvala and<br>Aswatara; and Dhritarashtra and Valahaka; Matimat and Kundadhara and<br>Karkotaka and Dhananjaya; Panimat and the mighty Kundaka, O lord of the<br>Earth; and Prahlada and Mushikada, and Janamejaya,&#8212;all having auspicious<br>marks and mandalas and extended hoods;&#8212;these and many other snakes. O<br>Yudhishthira, without anxiety of any kind, wait upon and worship the<br>illustrious Varuna. And, O king, Vali the son of Virochana, and Naraka<br>the subjugator of the whole Earth; Sanghraha and Viprachitti, and those<br>Danavas called Kalakanja; and Suhanu and Durmukha and Sankha and Sumanas<br>and also Sumati; and Ghatodara, and Mahaparswa, and Karthana and also<br>Pithara and Viswarupa, Swarupa and Virupa, Mahasiras; and Dasagriva,<br>Vali, and Meghavasas and Dasavara; Tittiva, and Vitabhuta, and Sanghrada,<br>and Indratapana&#8212;these Daityas and Danavas, all bedecked with ear-rings<br>and floral wreaths and crowns, and attired in the celestial robes, all<br>blessed with boons and possessed of great bravery, and enjoying<br>immortality, and all well of conduct and of excellent vows, wait upon and<br>worship in that mansion the illustrious Varuna, the deity bearing the<br>noose as his weapon. And, O king, there are also the four oceans, the<br>river Bhagirathee, the Kalindi, the Vidisa, the Venwa, the Narmada of<br>rapid current; the Vipasa, the Satadu, the Chandrabhaga, the Saraswati;<br>the Iravati, the Vitasta, the Sindhu, the Devanadi; the Godavari, the<br>Krishnavenwa and that queen of rivers the Kaveri; the Kimpuna, the<br>Visalya and the river Vaitarani also; the Tritiya, the Jeshthila, and the<br>great Sone (Soane); the Charmanwati and the great river Parnasa; the<br>Sarayu, the Varavatya, and that queen of rivers the Langali, the<br>Karatoya, the Atreyi, the red Mahanada, the Laghanti, the Gomati, the<br>Sandhya, and also the Trisrotasi&#8212;these and other rivers which are all<br>sacred and are world-renowned places of pilgrimage, as also other rivers<br>and sacred waters and lakes and wells and springs, and tanks, large or<br>small, in their personified form, O Bharata, wait upon and worship the<br>lord Varuna. The points of the heavens, the Earth, and all the Mountains,<br>as also every species of aquatic animals, all worship Varuna there. And<br>various tribes of Gandharvas and Apsaras, devoted to music, both vocal<br>and instrumental, wait upon Varuna, singing eulogistic hymns unto him.<br>And all those mountains that are noted for being both delightful and rich<br>in jewels, wait (in their personified forms) in that Sabha, enjoying<br>sweet converse with one another. And the chief minister of Varuna,<br>Sunabha by name, surrounded by his sons and grandsons, also attend upon<br>his master, along with (the personified form) of a sacred water called<br>go. These all, in their personified forms, worship the deity. O bull of<br>the Bharata race, such is the assembly room of Varuna seen by me before,<br>in the course of my wanderings. Listen now to the account I give of the<br>assembly room of Kuvera.'"
