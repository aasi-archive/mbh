                            "Sakuni said.&#8212;'O Duryodhana, thou shouldst not be jealous of<br>Yudhishthira. The sons of Pandu are enjoying what they deserve in<br>consequence of their own good fortune. O slayer of foes, O great king,<br>thou couldst not destroy them by repeatedly devising numberless plans,<br>many of which thou hadst even put to practice. Those tigers among men out<br>of sheer luck escaped all those machinations. They have obtained Draupadi<br>for wife and Drupada with his sons as also Vasudeva of great prowess as<br>allies, capable of helping them in subjugating the whole world. And O<br>king, having inherited the paternal share of the kingdom without being<br>deprived of it they have grown in consequence of their own energy. What<br>is there to make thee sorry for this? Having gratified Hustasana,<br>Dhananjaya hath obtained the bow Gandiva and the couple of inexhaustible<br>quivers and many celestial weapons. With that unique bow and by the<br>strength of his own arms also he hath brought all the kings of the world<br>under his sway. What is there to make thee sorry for this? Having saved<br>the Asura Maya from a conflagration, Arjuna, that slayer of foes, using<br>both his hands with equal skill, caused him to build that assembly house.<br>And it is for this also that commanded by Maya, those grim Rakshasas<br>called Kinkaras supported that assembly house. What is there in this to<br>make thee sorry? Thou hast said, O king, that thou art without allies.<br>This, O Bharata, is not true. These thy brothers are obedient to thee.<br>Drona of great prowess and wielding the large bow along with his son,<br>Radha's son Karna, the great warrior Gautama (Kripa), myself with my<br>brothers and king Saumadatti&#8212;these are thy allies. Uniting thyself with<br>these, conquer thou the whole of the earth.'<br><br>"Duryodhana said,&#8212;'O king, with thee, as also with these great warriors,<br>I shall subjugate the Pandavas, if it pleases thee. If I can now<br>subjugate them, the world will be mine and all the monarchs, and that<br>assembly house so full of wealth.'<br><br>"Sakuni replied,&#8212;'Dhananjaya and Vasudeva, Bhimasena and Yudhishthira,<br>Nakula and Sahadeva and Drupada with his sons,&#8212;these cannot be<br>vanquished in battle by even the celestials, for they are all great<br>warriors wielding the largest bows, accomplished in weapons, and<br>delighting in battle. But, O king, I know the means by which Yudhishthira<br>himself may be vanquished. Listen to me and adopt it.'<br><br>"Duryodhana said,&#8212;'without danger to our friends and other illustrious<br>men, O uncle, tell me if there is any way by which I may vanquish him.'<br><br>"Sakuni said,&#8212;'The son of Kunti is very fond of dice-play although he<br>doth not know how to play. That king if asked to play, is ill able to<br>refuse. I am skillful at dice. There is none equal to me in this respect<br>on earth, no, not even in the three worlds, O son of Kuru. Therefore, ask<br>him to play at dice. Skilled at dice, I will win his kingdom, and that<br>splendid prosperity of his for thee, O bull among men. But, O Duryodhana,<br>represent all this unto the king (Dhritarashtra). Commanded by thy father<br>I will win without doubt the whole of Yudhishthira's possessions.'<br><br>"Duryodhana said 'O son of Suvala, thou thyself represent properly all<br>this to Dhritarashtra, the chief of the Kurus. I shall not be able to do<br>so.
