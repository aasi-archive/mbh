                            "Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'O thou foremost of eloquent men, as thou hast<br>described the different Sabhas unto me, it appeareth that almost all the<br>monarchs of the earth are to be found in the Sabha of Yama. And, O<br>master, almost all the Nagas, and principal Daityas, and rivers, and<br>oceans, are to be found in the Sabha of Varuna. And so the Yakshas, the<br>Guhyakas, the Rakshasas, the Gandharvas and Apsaras and the Deity (Yama)<br>having the bull for his vehicle, are to be found in the Sabha of the lord<br>of treasures. Thou hast said that in the Sabha of the Grandsire are to be<br>seen all the great Rishis, all the gods, all the branches of learning. As<br>regards the Sabha of Sakra, however, thou hast named, O Muni, all the<br>gods, the Gandharvas, and various Rishis. But, O great Muni, thou hast<br>mentioned one and only one king, viz., the royal Rishi Harishchandra as<br>living in the Sabha of the illustrious chief of the gods. What act was<br>performed by that celebrated king, or what ascetic penances with steady<br>vows, in consequence of which he hath been equal to Indra himself? O<br>Brahmana, how didst thou also meet with my father, the exalted Pandu, now<br>a guest in the region of the Pitris? O exalted one of excellent vows hath<br>he told thee anything? O tell me all as I am exceedingly curious to hear<br>all this from thee."<br><br>"Narada said,&#8212;'O king of kings, I shall tell thee all that thou askest<br>me about Harischandra, I shall presently tell thee of his high<br>excellence. He was a powerful king, in fact, an emperor over all the<br>kings of the earth. Indeed, all the kings of the earth obeyed his sway. O<br>monarch, mounted alone upon a victorious car adorned with gold, that king<br>by the prowess of his weapons brought the whole earth with her seven<br>islands under his sway. And, O monarch, having subjugated the whole earth<br>with her mountains, forests, and woods, he made preparations for the<br>great sacrifice called the Rajasuya. And all the kings of the earth<br>brought at his command wealth unto that sacrifice. All of them consented<br>to become distributors of food and gifts unto the Brahmanas that were fed<br>on the occasion. At that sacrifice king Harishchandra gave away unto all<br>who asked, wealth that was five times what each had solicited. At the<br>conclusion of the sacrifice, the king gratified the Brahmanas that came<br>from various countries with large presents of various kinds of wealth.<br>The Brahmanas gratified with various kinds of food and enjoyable<br>articles, given away unto them to the extent of their desires, and with<br>the heaps of jewels distributed amongst them, began to say,&#8212;King<br>Harischandra is superior to all kings in energy and renown.&#8212;And know, O<br>monarch, O bull of the Bharata race, it was for this reason that<br>Harischandra shone more brightly than thousands of other kings. The<br>powerful Harischandra having concluded his great sacrifice, became<br>installed, O king, in the sovereignty of the earth and looked resplendent<br>on his throne. O bull of the Bharata race, all those monarchs that<br>perform the sacrifice of Rajasuya, (attaining to the region of Indra)<br>pass their time in felicity in Indra's company. And, O bull of the<br>Bharata race, those kings also that yield up their lives without turning<br>their backs on the field of battle attain to the mansion of Indra and<br>live in joy with him. Those again that yield up their bodies after severe<br>ascetic penances also attain to the same region and shine brightly there<br>for ages. O king of the Kuru race, O son of Kunti, thy father Pandu,<br>beholding the good fortune of Harischandra and wondering much thereat,<br>hath told thee something. Knowing that I was coming to the world of men,<br>he bowed unto me and said,&#8212;Thou shouldst tell Yudhishthira, O Rishi,<br>that he can subjugate the whole Earth inasmuch as his brothers are all<br>obedient to him. And having done this let him commence the grand<br>sacrifice called Rajasuya. He is my son; if he performeth that sacrifice,<br>I may, like Harischandra, soon attain to the region of Indra, and there<br>in his Sabha pass countless years in continuous joy. I told him in<br>reply,&#8212;O King, I shall tell thy son all this, if I go to the world of<br>man. I have now told thee what he said, O tiger among men. Accomplish<br>then, O son of Pandu, the desires of thy father. If thou performest that<br>sacrifice, thou shall then be able to go, along with thy deceased<br>ancestors, into the same region that is inhabited by the chief of the<br>immortals. It hath been said,&#8212;O king, that the performance of this great<br>sacrifice is attended with many obstacles. A class of Rakshasas called<br>Brahma Rakshasas, employed in obstructing all sacrifices, always search<br>for loop-holes when this great sacrifice is commenced. On the<br>commencement of such a sacrifice a war may take place destroying the<br>Kshatriyas and even furnishing occasion for the destruction of the whole<br>Earth. A slight obstacle may involve the whole Earth in ruin. Reflecting<br>upon all this, O king of kings do what is for thy good. Be thou watchful<br>and ready in protecting the four orders of thy subjects. Grow, thou in<br>prosperity, and enjoy thou felicity. Gratify thou the Brahmanas with<br>gifts of wealth. I have now answered in detail all that thou hast asked<br>me. With thy leave I will now go to the city (Dwaravati) of that<br>Dasarhas."<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;'O Janamejaya, having said this unto the son of<br>Pritha, Narada went away, accompanied by those Rishis with whom he had<br>come. And after Narada had gone away, king Yudhishthira, O thou of the<br>Kuru race, began to think, along with his brothers, of that foremost of<br>sacrifices called Rajasuya.'
