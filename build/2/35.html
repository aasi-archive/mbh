                            (Arghyaharana Parva)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said,&#8212;On the last day of the sacrifice when the king was<br>to be sprinkled over with the sacred water, the great Brahmana Rishis<br>ever deserving of respectful treatment, along with the invited kings,<br>entered together the inner enclosure of the sacrificial compound. And<br>those illustrious Rishis with Narada as their foremost, seated at their<br>ease with those royal sages within that enclosure, looked like the gods<br>seated in the mansion of Brahma in the company of the celestial Rishis.<br>Endued with immeasurable energy those Rishis, having obtained leisure,<br>started various topics of conversation. 'This is so,' 'This is not so,'<br>'This is even so.' 'This cannot be otherwise,'&#8212;thus did many of them<br>engage in discussions with one another. Some amongst the disputants, by<br>well-chosen arguments made the weaker position appear the stronger and<br>the stronger the weaker. Some disputants endued with great intelligence<br>fell upon the position urged by others like hawks darting at meat thrown<br>up into the air, while some amongst them versed in the interpretations of<br>religious treatises and others of rigid vows, and well-acquainted with<br>every commentary and gloss engaged themselves in pleasant converse. And,<br>O king, that platform crowded with gods, Brahmanas and great Rishis<br>looked extremely handsome like the wide expanse of the firmament studded<br>with stars. O monarch, there was then no Sudra near that platform of<br>Yudhisthira's mansion, nor anybody that was without vows.<br><br>"And Narada, beholding the fortunate Yudhisthira's prosperity that was<br>born of that sacrifice, became highly gratified. Beholding that vast<br>concourse all the Kshatriyas, the Muni Narada, O king of men, became<br>thoughtful. And, O bull amongst men, the Rishi began to recollect the<br>words he had heard of old in the mansion of Brahma regarding the<br>incarnation on earth of portions of every deity. And knowing, O son of<br>the Kuru race, that that was a concourse (of incarnate) gods, Narada<br>thought in his mind of Hari with eyes like lotus-petals. He knew that<br>that creator himself of every object one, that exalted of all<br>gods&#8212;Narayana&#8212;who had formerly commanded the celestials, saying,&#8212;'Be<br>ye born on earth and slay one another and come back to heaven'&#8212;that<br>slayer of all the enemies of the gods, that subjugator of all hostile<br>towns, in order to fulfil his own promise, had been born in the Kshatriya<br>order. And Narada knew that the exalted and holy Narayana, also called<br>Sambhu the lord of the universe, having commanded all the celestials<br>thus, had taken his birth in the race of Yadus and that foremost of all<br>perpetuator of races, having sprung from the line of the Andhaka-Vrishnis<br>on earth was graced with great good fortune and was shining like the moon<br>herself among stars. Narada knew that Hari the grinder of foes, whose<br>strength of arm was ever praised by all the celestials with Indra among<br>them, was then living in the world in human form. Oh, the Self-Create<br>will himself take away (from the earth) this vast concourse of Kshatriyas<br>endued with so much strength. Such was the vision of Narada the<br>omniscient who knew Hari or Narayana to be that Supreme Lord whom<br>everybody worshipped with sacrifice. And Narada, gifted with great<br>intelligence and the foremost of all persons and conversant with<br>morality, thinking of all this, sat at that sacrifice of the wise king<br>Yudhisthira the just with feelings of awe.<br><br>"Then Bhishma, O king, addressing king Yudhisthira the just, said, "O<br>Bharata, let Arghya (an article of respect) be offered unto the kings as<br>each of them deserveth. Listen, O Yudhishthira, the preceptor, the<br>sacrificial priest, the relative, the Snataka, the friend, and the king,<br>it hath been said are the six that deserve Arghya. The wise have said<br>that when any of these dwell with one for full one year he deserveth to<br>be worshipped with Arghya. These kings have been staying with us for some<br>time. Therefore, O king, let Arghyas be procured to be offered unto each<br>of them. And let an Arghya be presented first of all unto him among those<br>present who is the foremost.<br><br>"Hearing these words of Bhishma, Yudhishthira said&#8212;'O Grandsire, O thou<br>of the Kuru race, whom thou deemest the foremost amongst these and unto<br>whom the Arghya should be presented by us, O tell me.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;Then, O Bharata, Bhishma the son of Santanu,<br>judged it by his intelligence that on earth Krishna was the foremost of<br>all. And he said&#8212;'As is the sun among all luminous objects, so is the<br>one (meaning Krishna) (who shines like the sun) among us all, in<br>consequence of his energy, strength and prowess. And this our sacrificial<br>mansion is illuminated and gladdened by him as a sunless region by the<br>sun, or a region of still air by a gust of breeze. Thus commanded by<br>Bhishma, Sahadeva endued with great prowess duly presented the first<br>Arghya of excellent ingredients unto Krishna of the Vrishni race. Krishna<br>also accepted it according to the forms of the ordinance. But Sisupala<br>could not bear to see that worship offered unto Vasudeva. And this mighty<br>king of Chedi, reproving in the midst of that assembly both Bhishma and.<br>Yudhishthira, censured Vasudeva thereafter."
