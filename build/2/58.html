                            Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"The sons of Pritha with Yudhishthira at their head,<br>having entered that assembly house, approached all the kings that were<br>present there. And worshipping all those that deserved to be worshipped,<br>and saluting others as each deserved according to age, they seated<br>themselves on seats that were clean and furnished with costly carpets.<br>After they had taken their seats, as also all the kings, Sakuni the son<br>of Suvala addressed Yudhishthira and said, 'O king, the assembly is full.<br>All had been waiting for thee. Let, therefore, the dice be cast and the<br>rules of play be fixed, O Yudhishthira.'<br><br>'Yudhishthira replied, 'Deceitful gambling is sinful. There is no<br>Kshatriya prowess in it. There is certainly no morality in it. Why, then,<br>O king, dost thou praise gambling so? The wise applaud not the pride that<br>gamesters feel in deceitful play. O Sakuni, vanquish us, not like a<br>wretch, by deceitful means.'<br><br>Sakuni said,&#8212;'That high-souled player who knoweth the secrets of winning<br>and losing, who is skilled in baffling the deceitful arts of his<br>confrere, who is united in all the diverse operations of which gambling<br>consisteth, truly knoweth the play, and he suffereth all in course of it.<br>O son of Pritha, it is the staking at dice, which may be lost or won that<br>may injure us. And it is for that reason that gambling is regarded as a<br>fault. Let us, therefore, O king, begin the play. Fear not. Let the<br>stakes be fixed. Delay not!'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'That best of Munis, Devala, the son of Asita, who<br>always instructeth us about all those acts that may lead to heaven, hell,<br>or the other regions, hath said, that it is sinful to play deceitfully<br>with a gamester. To obtain victory in battle without cunning or stratagem<br>is the best sport. Gambling, however, as a sport, is not so. Those that<br>are respectable never use the language of the Mlechchas, nor do they<br>adopt deceitfulness in their behaviour. War carried on without<br>crookedness and cunning, this is the act of men that are honest. Do not,<br>O Sakuni, playing desperately, win of us that wealth with which according<br>to our abilities, we strive to learn how to benefit the Brahmanas. Even<br>enemies should not be vanquished by desperate stakes in deceitful play. I<br>do not desire either happiness or wealth by means of cunning. The conduct<br>of one that is a gamester, even if it be without deceitfulness, should<br>not be applauded.'<br><br>"Sakuni said,&#8212;'O Yudhishthira, it is from a desire of winning, which is<br>not a very honest motive, that one high-born person approacheth another<br>(in a contest of race superiority). So also it is from a desire of<br>defeating, which is not a very honest motive, that one learned person<br>approacheth another (in a contest of learning). Such motives, however,<br>are scarcely regarded as really dishonest. So also, O Yudhishthira, a<br>person skilled at dice approacheth one that is not so skilled from a<br>desire of vanquishing him. One also who is conversant with the truths of<br>science approacheth another that is not from desire of victory, which is<br>scarcely an honest motive. But (as I have already said) such a motive is<br>not really dishonest. And, O Yudhishthira, so also one that is skilled in<br>weapons approacheth one that is not so skilled; the strong approacheth<br>the weak. This is the practice in every contest. The motive is victory, O<br>Yudhishthira. If, therefore, thou, in approaching me, regardest me to be<br>actuated by motives that are dishonest, if thou art under any fear,<br>desist then from play.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'Summoned, I do not withdraw. This is my established<br>vow. And, O king, Fate is all powerful. We all are under the control of<br>Destiny. With whom in this assembly am I to play? Who is there that can<br>stake equally with me? Let the play begin.'<br><br>"Duryodhana said,&#8212;'O monarch, I shall supply jewels and gems and every<br>kind of wealth. And it is for me that this Sakuni, my uncle, will play.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'Gambling for one's sake by the agency of another<br>seemeth to me to be contrary to rule. Thou also, O learned one, will<br>admit this. If, however, thou art still bent on it, let the play begin.'"
