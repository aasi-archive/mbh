                            Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"thus also Sahadeva, dismissed with affection by king<br>Yudhisthira the just, marched towards the southern direction accompanied<br>by a mighty host. Strong in strength, that mighty prince of the Kuru<br>race, vanquishing completely at the outset the Surasenas, brought the<br>king of Matsya under his sway. And the hero then, defeating Dantavakra,<br>the mighty king of the Adhirajas and making him pay tribute,<br>re-established him on his throne. The prince then brought under his sway<br>Sukumara and then king Sumitra, and he next vanquished the other Matsyas<br>and then the Patacharas. Endued with great intelligence, the Kuru warrior<br>then conquered soon enough the country of the Nishadas and also the high<br>hill called Gosringa, and that lord of earth called Srenimat. And<br>subjugating next the country called Navarashtra, the hero marched against<br>Kuntibhoja, who with great willingness accepted the sway of the<br>conquering hero. And marching thence to the banks of the Charmanwati, the<br>Kuru warrior met the son of king Jamvaka, who had, on account of old<br>hostilities, been defeated before by Vasudeva. O Bharata, the son of<br>Jamvaka gave battle to Sahadeva. And Sahadeva defeating the prince<br>marched towards the south. The mighty warrior then vanquished the Sekas<br>and others, and exacted tributes from them and also various kinds of gems<br>and wealth. Allying himself with the vanquished tribes the prince then<br>marched towards the countries that lay on the banks of the Narmada. And<br>defeating there in battle the two heroic kings of Avanti, called Vinda<br>and Anuvinda, supported by a mighty host, the mighty son of the twin gods<br>exacted much wealth from them. After this the hero marched towards the<br>town of Bhojakata, and there, O king of unfading glory, a fierce<br>encounter took place between him and the king of that city for two whole<br>days. But the son of Madri, vanquishing the invincible Bhismaka, then<br>defeated in battle the king of Kosala and the ruler of the territories<br>lying on the banks of the Venwa, as also the Kantarakas and the kings of<br>the eastern Kosalas. The hero then defeating both the Natakeyas and the<br>Heramvaks in battle, and subjugating the country of Marudha, reduced<br>Munjagrama by sheer strength. And the son of Pandu then vanquished the<br>mighty monarchs of the Nachinas and the Arvukas and the various forest<br>king of that part of the country. Endued with great strength the hero<br>then reduced to subjection king Vatadhipa. And defeating in battle the<br>Pulindas, the hero then marched southward. And the younger brother of<br>Nakula then fought for one whole day with the king of Pandrya. The<br>long-armed hero having vanquished that monarch marched further to the<br>south. And then he beheld the celebrated caves of Kishkindhya and in that<br>region fought for seven days with the monkey-kings Mainda and Dwivida.<br>Those illustrious kings however, without being tired an the encounter,<br>were gratified with Sahadeva. And joyfully addressing the Kuru prince,<br>they said,&#8212;'O tiger among the sons of Pandu, go hence, taking with the<br>tribute from us all. Let the mission of the king Yudhishthira the just<br>possessed of great intelligence, be accomplished without hindrance. And<br>taking jewels and gems from them all, the hero marched towards the city<br>of Mahishmati, and there that bull of men did battle with king Nila. The<br>battle that took place between king Nila and the mighty Sahadeva the son<br>of Pandu, that slayer of hostile heroes, was fierce and terrible. And the<br>encounter was an exceedingly bloody one, and the life of the hero himself<br>was exposed to great risk, for the god Agni himself assisted king Nila in<br>that fight. Then the cars, heroes, elephants, and the soldiers in their<br>coats of mail of Sahadeva's army all appeared to be on fire. And<br>beholding this the prince of the Kuru race became exceedingly anxious.<br>And, O Janamejaya, at sight of this the hero could not resolve upon what<br>he should do.<br><br>Janamejaya said,&#8212;O regenerate one, why was it that the god Agni become<br>hostile in battle unto Sahadeva, who was fighting simply for the<br>accomplishment of a sacrifice (and therefore, for the gratification of<br>Agni himself)?<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;'It is said, O Janamejaya, that the god Agni while<br>residing in Mahishmati, earned the reputation of a lover. King Nila had a<br>daughter who was exceedingly beautiful. She used always to stay near the<br>sacred fire of her father, causing it to blaze up with vigour. And it so<br>happened that king Nila's fire, even if fanned, would not blaze up till<br>agitated by the gentle breath of that girl's fair lips. And it was said<br>in King Nila's palace and in the house of all his subjects that the god<br>Agni desired that beautiful girl for his bride. And it so happened that<br>he was accepted by the girl herself. One day the deity assuming the form<br>of a Brahmana, was happily enjoying the society of the fair one, when he<br>was discovered by the king. And the virtuous king thereupon ordered the<br>Brahmana to be punished according to law. At this the illustrious deity<br>flamed up in wrath. And beholding this, the king wondered much and bent<br>his head low on the ground. And after some time the king bowing low<br>bestowed the daughter of his upon the god Agni, disguised as a Brahmana.<br>And the god Vibhabasu (Agni) accepting that fair-browed daughter of king<br>Nila, became gracious unto that monarch. And Agni, the illustrious<br>gratifier of all desires also asked the monarch to beg a boon of him. And<br>the king begged that his troops might never be struck with panic while<br>engaged in battle. And from that time, O king, those monarchs who from<br>ignorance of this, desire to subjugate king Nila's city, are consumed by<br>Hutasana (Agni). And from that time, O perpetuator of the Kuru race, the<br>girls of the city of Mahishmati became rather unacceptable to others (as<br>wives). And Agni by his boon granted them sexual liberty, so that the<br>women of that town always roam about at will, each unbound to a<br>particular husband. And, O bull of the Bharata race, from that time the<br>monarchs (of other countries) forsake this city for fear of Agni. And the<br>virtuous Sahadeva, beholding his troops afflicted with fear and<br>surrounded by flames of fire, himself stood there immovable as a<br>mountain. And purifying himself and touching water, the hero (Sahadeva)<br>then addressed Agni, the god that sanctifieth everything, in these<br>words,&#8212;<br><br>'I bow unto thee, O thou whose track is always marked with smoke. These<br>my exertions are all for thee. O thou sanctifier of all, thou art the<br>mouth of the gods and thou art Sacrifice personified. Thou art called<br>Pavaka because thou sanctifiest everything, and thou art Havyavahana,<br>because thou carriest the clarified butter that is poured on thee. The<br>Veda have sprung for ministering unto thee, and, therefore, thou art<br>called Jataveda. Chief of the gods as thou art, thou art called<br>Chitrabhanu, Anala, Vibhavasu, Hutasana, Jvalana, Sikhi, Vaiswanara,<br>Pingesa, Plavanga, Bhuritejah. Thou art he from whom Kumara (Kartikeya)<br>had his origin; thou art holy; thou art called Rudragarva and<br>Hiranyakrit. Let thee, O Agni, grant me energy, let Vayu grant me life,<br>let Earth grant me nourishment and strength, and let Water grant me<br>prosperity. O Agni, thou who art the first cause of the waters, thou who<br>art of great purity, thou for ministering unto whom the Vedas have<br>sprung, thou who art the foremost of the deities, thou who art their<br>mouth, O purify me by thy truth. Rishis and Brahmanas, Deities and Asuras<br>pour clarified butter every day, according to the ordinance into thee<br>during sacrifices. Let the rays of truth emanating from thee, while thou<br>exhibitest thyself in those sacrifices, purify me. Smoke-bannered as thou<br>art and possessed of flames, thou great purifier from all sins born of<br>Vayu and ever present as thou art in all creatures, O purify me by the<br>rays of thy truth. Having cleansed myself thus cheerfully, O exalted one,<br>do I pray unto thee. O Agni, grant me now contentment and prosperity, and<br>knowledge and gladness.<br><br>Vaisampayana continued.&#8212;'He that will pour clarified butter into Agni<br>reciting these mantras, will ever be blessed with prosperity, and having<br>his soul under complete control will also be cleansed from all his sins.<br><br>"Sahadeva, addressing Agni again, said,&#8212;'O carrier of the sacrificial<br>libations, it behoveth thee not to obstruct a sacrifice!' Having said<br>this, that tiger among men&#8212;the son of Madri&#8212;spreading some kusa grass<br>on earth sat down in expectation of the (approaching) fire and in front<br>of those terrified and anxious troops of his. And Agni, too, like the<br>ocean that never transgresseth its continents, did not pass over his<br>head. On the other hand approaching Sahadeva quietly and addressing that<br>prince of the Kuru race, Agni that god of men gave him every assurance<br>and said,&#8212;'O thou of the Kuru race, rise up from this posture. O rise<br>up, I was only trying thee. I know all thy purpose, as also those of the<br>son of Dharma (Yudhisthira). But, O best of the Bharata race, as long as<br>there is a descendant of king Nila's line, so long should this town be<br>protected by me. I will, however O son of Pandu, gratify the desires of<br>thy heart. And at these words of Agni, O bull of the Bharata race, the<br>son of Madri rose up with a cheerful heart, and joining his hands and<br>bending his head worshipped that god of fire, sanctifier of all beings.<br>And at last, after Agni had disappeared, king Nila came there, and at the<br>command of that deity, worshipped with due rites Sahadeva, that tiger<br>among men&#8212;that master of battle. And Sahadeva accepted that worship and<br>made him pay tribute. And having brought king Nila under his sway thus,<br>the victorious son of Madri then went further towards the south. The<br>long-armed hero then brought the king of Tripura of immeasurable energy<br>under his sway. And next turning his forces against the Paurava kingdom,<br>he vanquished and reduced to subjection the monarch thereof. And the<br>prince, after this, with great efforts brought Akriti, the king of<br>Saurashtra and preceptor of the Kausikas under his sway. The virtuous<br>prince, while staying in the kingdom of Saurashtra sent an ambassador<br>unto king Rukmin of Bhishmaka within the territories of Bhojakata, who,<br>rich in possessions and intelligence, was the friend of Indra himself.<br>And the monarch along with his son, remembering their relationship with<br>Krishna, cheerfully accepted, O king, the sway of the son of Pandu. And<br>the master of battle then, having exacted jewels and wealth from king<br>Rukmin, marched further to the south. And, endued with great energy and<br>great strength, the hero then, reduced to subjection, Surparaka and<br>Talakata, and the Dandakas also. The Kuru warrior then vanquished and<br>brought under his subjection numberless kings of the Mlechchha tribe<br>living on the sea coast, and the Nishadas and the cannibals and even the<br>Karnapravarnas, and those tribes also called the Kalamukhas who were a<br>cross between human beings and Rakshasas, and the whole of the Cole<br>mountains, and also Surabhipatna, and the island called the Copper<br>island, and the mountain called Ramaka. The high-souled warrior, having<br>brought under subjection king Timingila, conquered a wild tribe known by<br>the name of the Kerakas who were men with one leg. The son of Pandu also<br>conquered the town of Sanjayanti and the country of the Pashandas and the<br>Karahatakas by means of his messengers alone, and made all of them pay<br>tributes to him. The hero brought under his subjection and exacted<br>tributes from the Paundrayas and the Dravidas along with the Udrakeralas<br>and the Andhras and the Talavanas, the Kalingas and the Ushtrakarnikas,<br>and also the delightful city of Atavi and that of the Yavanas. And, O<br>king of kings, that slayer of all foes, the virtuous and intelligent son<br>of Madri having arrived at the sea-shore, then despatched with great<br>assurance messengers unto the illustrious Vibhishana, the grandson of<br>Pulastya. And the monarch willingly accepted the sway of the son of<br>Pandu, for that intelligent and exalted king regarded it all as the act<br>of Time. And he sent unto the son of Pandu diverse kinds of jewels and<br>gems, and sandal and also wood, and many celestial ornaments, and much<br>costly apparel, and many valuable pearls. And the intelligent Sahadeva,<br>accepting them all, returned to his own kingdom.<br><br>"Thus it was, O king, that slayer of all foes, having vanquished by<br>conciliation and war numerous kings and having also made them pay<br>tribute, came back to his own city. The bull of the Bharata race, having<br>presented the whole of that wealth unto king Yudhisthira the just<br>regarded himself, O Janamejaya, as crowned with success and continued to<br>live happily."
