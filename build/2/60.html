                            Yudhishthira said,&#8212;"Thou hast won this stake of me by unfair means. But<br>be not so proud, O Sakuni. Let us play staking thousands upon thousands.<br>I have many beautiful jars each full of a thousand Nishkas in my<br>treasury, inexhaustible gold, and much silver and other minerals. This, O<br>king, is the wealth with which I will stake with thee!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Thus addressed, Sakuni said unto the chief of<br>the perpetuators of the Kuru race, the eldest of the sons of Pandu, king<br>Yudhishthira, of glory incapable of sustaining any diminution. 'Lo, I<br>have won!'"<br><br>Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'This my sacred and victorious and royal car which<br>gladdeneth the heart and hath carried us hither, which is equal unto a<br>thousand cars, which is of symmetrical proportions and covered with<br>tiger-skin, and furnished with excellent wheels and flag-staffs which is<br>handsome, and decked with strings of little bells, whose clatter is even<br>like the roar of the clouds or of the ocean, and which is drawn by eight<br>noble steeds known all over the kingdom and which are white as the<br>moon-beam and from whose hoofs no terrestrial creature can escape&#8212;this,<br>O king, is my wealth with which I will stake with thee!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Hearing these words, Sakuni ready with the<br>dice, and adopting unfair means, said unto Yudhishthira, 'Lo, I have won!'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'I have a hundred thousand serving-girls, all young,<br>and decked with golden bracelets on their wrists and upper arms, and with<br>nishkas round their necks and other ornaments, adorned with costly<br>garlands and attired in rich robes, daubed with the sandal paste, wearing<br>jewels and gold, and well-skilled in the four and sixty elegant arts,<br>especially versed in dancing and singing, and who wait upon and serve at<br>my command the celestials, the Snataka Brahmanas, and kings. With this<br>wealth, O king, I will stake with thee!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;'Hearing these words, Sakuni ready with the<br>dice, adopting unfair means, said unto Yudhishthira. 'Lo, I have won!'<br><br>Yudhishthira said,&#8212;"I have thousands of serving-men, skilled in waiting<br>upon guests, always attired in silken robes, endued with wisdom and<br>intelligence, their senses under control though young, and decked with<br>ear-rings, and who serve all guests night and day with plates and dishes<br>in hand. With this wealth, O king, I will stake with thee!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Hearing these words, Sakuni, ready with the<br>dice, adopting unfair means said unto Yudhishthira, 'Lo, I have won!'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'I have, O son of Suvala, one thousand musty<br>elephants with golden girdles, decked with ornaments, with the mark of<br>the lotus on their temples and necks and other parts, adorned with golden<br>garlands, with fine white tusks long and thick as plough-shafts, worthy<br>of carrying kings on their backs, capable of bearing every kind of noise<br>on the field of battle, with huge bodies, capable of battering down the<br>walls of hostile towns, of the colour of new-formed clouds, and each<br>possessing eight she-elephants. With this wealth, O king, I will stake<br>with thee.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Unto Yudhishthira who had said so, Sakuni, the<br>son of Suvala, laughingly said, 'Lo, I have won it!'<br><br>Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'I have as many cars as elephants, all furnished with<br>golden poles and flag-staffs and well-trained horses and warriors that<br>fight wonderfully and each of whom receiveth a thousand coins as his<br>monthly pay whether he fighteth or not. With this wealth, O king, I will<br>stake with thee!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"When these words had been spoken, the wretch<br>Sakuni, pledged to enmity, said unto Yudhishthira, 'Lo, I have won it.'<br><br>Yudhishthira said.&#8212;'The steeds of the Tittiri, Kalmasha, and Gandharva<br>breeds, decked with ornaments, which Chitraratha having been vanquished<br>in battle and subdued cheerfully gave unto Arjuna, the wielder of the<br>Gandiva. With this wealth, O king, I will stake with thee."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued, "Hearing this, Sakuni, ready at dice, adopting<br>unfair means, said unto Yudhishthira: 'Lo, I have won!'<br><br>Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'I have ten thousand cars and vehicles unto which are<br>yoked draught animals of the foremost breed. And I have also sixty<br>thousand warriors picked from each order by thousands, who are all brave<br>and endued with prowess like heroes, who drink milk and eat good rice,<br>and all of whom have broad chests. With this wealth, O king, I will stake<br>with thee.'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Hearing this, Sakuni ready at dice, adopting<br>unfair means said unto Yudhishthira, 'Lo, I have won!'<br><br>Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'I have four hundred Nidis (jewels of great value)<br>encased in sheets of copper and iron. Each one of them is equal to five<br>draunikas of the costliest and purest leaf gold of the Jatarupa kind.<br>With this wealth, O king, I will stake with thee.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Hearing this, Sakuni ready at dice, adopting<br>foul means, said unto Yudhishthira, 'Lo, I have won it!'"
