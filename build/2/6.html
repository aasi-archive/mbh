                            "Vaisampayana said,&#8212;At the conclusion of Narada's words, king<br>Yudhishthira the just worshipped him duly; and commanded by him the<br>monarch began to reply succinctly to the questions the Rishi had asked.<br><br>"Yudhishthira said&#8212;'O holy one, the truths of religion and morality thou<br>hast indicated one after another, are just and proper. As regards myself,<br>I duly observe those ordinances to the best of my power. Indeed, the acts<br>that were properly performed by monarchs of yore are, without doubt, to<br>be regarded as bearing proper fruit, and undertaken from solid reasons<br>for the attainment of proper objects. O master, we desire to walk in the<br>virtuous path of those rulers that had, besides, their souls under<br>complete control."<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Yudhishthira, the son of Pandu, possessed of<br>great glory, having received with reverence the words of Narada and<br>having also answered the Rishi thus, reflected for a moment. And<br>perceiving a proper opportunity, the monarch, seated beside the Rishi,<br>asked Narada sitting at his ease and capable of going into every world at<br>will, in the presence of that assembly of kings, saying,&#8212;'Possessed of<br>the speed of mind, thou wanderest over various and many worlds created in<br>days of yore by Brahma, beholding everything. Tell me, I ask thee, if<br>thou hast, O Brahmana, ever beheld before anywhere an assembly room like<br>this of mine or superior to it!' Hearing these words of Yudhishthira the<br>just, Narada smilingly answered the son of Pandu in these sweet accents,&#8212;<br><br>"Narada said,&#8212;'O child, O king I did neither see nor hear of ever before<br>amongst men, any assembly room built of gems and precious stones like<br>this of thine, O Bharata. I shall, however, describe unto thee the rooms<br>of the king of the departed (Yama), of Varuna (Neptune) of great<br>intelligence, of Indra, the King of Gods and also of him who hath his<br>home in Kailasha (Kuvera). I shall also describe unto thee the celestial<br>Sabha of Brahma that dispelleth every kind of uneasiness. All these<br>assembly rooms exhibit in their structure both celestial and human<br>designs and present every kind of form that exists in the universe. And<br>they are ever worshipped by the gods and the Pitris, the Sadhyas,<br>(under-deities called Gana), by ascetics offering sacrifices, with souls<br>under complete command, by peaceful Munis engaged without intermission in<br>Vedic sacrifices with presents to Brahmanas. I shall describe all these<br>to you if, O bull of the Bharata race, thou hast any inclinations to<br>listen to me!'"<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Thus addressed by Narada, the high-souled king<br>Yudhishthira the just, with his brothers and all those foremost of<br>Brahmanas (seated around him), joined his hands (in entreaty). And the<br>monarch then asked Narada, saying,&#8212;'Describe unto us all those assembly<br>rooms. We desire to listen to thee. O Brahmana, what are the articles<br>with which each of the Sabhas are made of? What is the area of each, and<br>what is the length and breadth of each? Who wait upon the Grandsire in<br>that assembly room? And who also upon Vasava, the Lord of the celestials<br>and upon Yama, the son of Vivaswana? Who wait upon Varuna and upon Kuvera<br>in their respective assembly rooms. O Brahmana Rishi, tell us all about<br>these. We all together desire to hear thee describe them. Indeed, our<br>curiosity is great.' Thus addressed by the son of Pandu, Narada replied,<br>saying,&#8212;'O monarch, hear ye all about those celestial assembly rooms one<br>after another."
