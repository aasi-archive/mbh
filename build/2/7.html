                            "Narada said,&#8212;the celestial assembly room of Sakra is full of lustre. He<br>hath obtained it as the fruit of his own acts. Possessed of the splendour<br>of the sun, it was built, O scion of the Kuru race, by Sakra himself.<br>Capable of going everywhere at will, this celestial assembly house is<br>full one hundred and fifty yojanas in length, and hundred yojanas in<br>breadth, and five yojanas in height. Dispelling weakness of age, grief,<br>fatigue, and fear, auspicious and bestowing good fortune, furnished with<br>rooms and seats and adorned with celestial trees, it is delightful in the<br>extreme. There sitteth in that assembly room, O son of Pritha, on an<br>excellent seat, the Lord of celestials, with his wife Sachi endowed with<br>beauty and affluence. Assuming a form incapable of description for its<br>vagueness, with a crown on his head and bright bracelets on the upper<br>arms, attired in robes of pure white and decked with floral wreaths of<br>many hues, there he sitteth with beauty, fame, and glory by his side. And<br>the illustrious deity of a hundred sacrifices is daily waited upon. O<br>monarch, in that assembly by the Marutas in a body, each leading the life<br>of a householder in the bosom of his family. And the Siddhyas, celestial<br>Rishis, the Sadhyas in all, the gods, and Marutas of brilliant complexion<br>and adorned with golden garlands,&#8212;all of them in celestial form and<br>decked in ornaments, always wait upon and worship the illustrious chief<br>of the immortals, that mighty represser of all foes. And O son of Pritha,<br>the celestial Rishis also, all of pure souls, with sins completely washed<br>off and resplendent as the fire, and possessed of energy, and without<br>sorrow of any kind, and freed from the fever of anxiety, and all<br>performers of the Soma sacrifice, also wait upon and worship Indra. And<br>Parasara and Parvata and Savarni and Galava; and Sankha, and the Muni,<br>Gaursiras, and Durvasa, and Krodhana and Swena and the Muni Dhirghatamas;<br>and Pavitrapani, Savarni, Yajnavalkya and Bhaluki; and Udyalaka,<br>Swetaketu, and Tandya, and also Bhandayani; and Havishmat, and Garishta,<br>and king Harischandra; and Hridya, Udarshandilya. Parasarya, Krishivala;<br>Vataskandha, Visakha, Vidhatas and Kala. Karaladanta, Tastri, and<br>Vishwakarman, and Tumuru; and other Rishis, some born of women and others<br>living upon air, and others again living upon fire, these all worship<br>Indra, the wielder of the thunderbolt, the lord of all the worlds. And<br>Sahadeva, and Sunitha, and Valmiki of great ascetic merit; and Samika of<br>truthful speech, and Prachetas ever fulfilling their promises, and<br>Medhatithi, and Vamadeva, and Pulastya, Pulaha and Kratu; and Maruta and<br>Marichi, and Sthanu of great ascetic merit; and Kakshivat, and Gautama,<br>and Tarkhya, and also the Muni Vaishwanara; and the Muni Kalakavrikhiya<br>and Asravya, and also Hiranmaya, and Samvartta, and Dehavya, and<br>Viswaksena of great energy; and Kanwa, and Katyayana, O king, and Gargya,<br>and Kaushika;&#8212;all are present there along with the celestial waters and<br>plants; and faith, and intelligence, and the goddess of learning, and<br>wealth, religion, and pleasure; and lightning. O son of Pandu; and the<br>rain-charged clouds, and the winds, and all the loud-sounding forces of<br>heaven; the eastern point, the twenty seven fires conveying the<br>sacrificial butter, Agni and Soma, and the fire of Indra, and Mitra, and<br>Savitri, and Aryaman; Bhaga, Viswa the Sadhyas, the preceptor<br>(Vrihaspati), and also Sukra; and Vishwavasu and Chitrasena, and Sumanas,<br>and also Taruna; the Sacrifices, the gifts to Brahmanas, the planets, and<br>the stars, O Bharata, and the mantras that are uttered in sacrifices&#8212;all<br>these are present there. And, O King, many Apsaras and Gandharvas, by<br>various kinds of dances and music both instrumental and vocal, and by the<br>practice of auspicious rites, and by the exhibition of many feats of<br>skill, gratify the lord of the celestials&#8212;Satakratu&#8212;the illustrious<br>slayer of Vala and Vritra. Besides these, many other Brahmanas and royal<br>and celestial Rishis, all resplendent as the fire, decked in floral<br>wreaths and ornaments, frequently come to and leave that assembly, riding<br>on celestial cars of various kinds. And Vrihaspati and Sukra are present<br>there on all occasions. These and many other illustrious ascetics of<br>rigid wows, and Bhrigu and the seven Rishis who are equal, O king, unto<br>Brahma himself, come to and leave that assembly house, riding on cars<br>beautiful as the car of Soma, and themselves looking as bright therein as<br>Soma himself. This, O mighty armed monarch, is the assembly house, called<br>Pushkaramalini, of Indra of a hundred sacrifices that I have seen. Listen<br>now to the account of Yama's assembly house."
