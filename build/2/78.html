                            Vaisampayana said,&#8212;'Then when Draupadi was about to set out she went<br>unto the illustrious Pritha and solicited her leave. And she also asked<br>leave of the other ladies of the household who had all been plunged into<br>grief. And saluting and embracing every one of them as each deserved, she<br>desired to go away. Then there arose within the inner apartments of the<br>Pandavas a loud wail of woe. And Kunti, terribly afflicted upon beholding<br>Draupadi on the eve of her journey, uttered these words in a voice choked<br>with grief,&#8212;<br><br>'O child, grieve not that this great calamity hath overtaken thee. Thou<br>art well conversant with the duties of the female sex, and thy behaviour<br>and conduct also are as they should be. It behoveth me not, O thou of<br>sweet smiles, to instruct thee as to thy duties towards thy lords. Thou<br>art chaste and accomplished, and thy qualities have adorned the race of<br>thy birth as also the race into which thou hast been admitted by<br>marriage. Fortunate are the Kauravas that they have not been burnt by thy<br>wrath. O child, safely go thou blest by my prayers. Good women never<br>suffer their hearts to the unstung at what is inevitable. Protected by<br>virtue that is superior to everything, soon shalt thou obtain good<br>fortune. While living in the woods, keep thy eye on my child Sahadeva.<br>See that his heart sinketh not under this great calamity.'<br><br>"Saying 'So be it!' the princess Draupadi bathed in tears, and clad in<br>one piece of cloth, stained with blood, and with hair dishevelled left<br>her mother-in-law. And as she went away weeping and wailing Pritha<br>herself in grief followed her. She had not gone far when she saw her sons<br>shorn of their ornaments and robes, their bodies clad in deerskins, and<br>their heads down with shame. And she beheld them surrounded by rejoicing<br>foes' and pitied by friends. Endued with excess of parental affection,<br>Kunti approached her sons in that state, and embracing them all, and in<br>accents choked by woe, She said these words,&#8212;<br><br>"Ye are virtuous and good-mannered, and adorned with all excellent<br>qualities and respectful behaviour. Ye are all high-minded, and engaged<br>in the service of your superiors. And ye are also devoted to the gods and<br>the performance of sacrifices. Why, then, hath this calamity overtaken<br>you. Whence is this reverse of fortune? I do not see by whose wickedness<br>this sin hath overtaken you. Alas I have brought you forth. All this must<br>be due to my ill fortune. It is for this that ye have been overtaken by<br>this calamity, though ye all are endued with excellent virtues. In energy<br>and prowess and strength and firmness and might, ye are not wanting. How<br>shall ye now, losing your wealth and possessions, live poor in the<br>pathless woods? If I had known before that ye were destined to live in<br>the woods, I would not have on Pandit's death come from the mountains of<br>Satasringa to Hastinapore. Fortunate was your father, as I now regard,<br>for he truly reaped the fruit of his asceticism, and he was gifted with<br>foresight, as he entertained the wish of ascending heaven, without having<br>to feel any pain on account of his sons. Fortunate also was the virtuous<br>Madri, as I regard her today, who had, it seems, a fore-knowledge of what<br>would happen and who on that account, obtained the high path of<br>emancipation and every blessing therewith. All, Madri looked upon me as<br>her stay, and her mind and her affections were ever fixed on me. Oh, fie<br>on my desire of life, owing to which suffer all this woe. Ye children, ye<br>are all excellent and dear unto me. I have obtained you alter much<br>suffering. I cannot leave you. Even I will go with you. Alas, O Krishna,<br>(Draupadi), why dost thou leave me so? Everything endued with life is<br>sure to perish. Hath Dhata (Brahma) himself forgotten to ordain my death?<br>Perhaps, it is so, and, therefore, life doth not quit me. O Krishna, O<br>thou who dwellest in Dwaraka, O younger brother of Sankarshana, where art<br>thou? Why dost thou not deliver me and these best of men also from such<br>woe? They say that thou who art without beginning and without end<br>deliverest those that think of thee. Why doth this saying become untrue.<br>These my sons are ever attached to virtue and nobility and good fame and<br>prowess. They deserve not to suffer affliction. Oh, show them mercy.<br>Alas, when there are such elders amongst our race as Bhishma and Drona<br>and Kripa, all conversant with morality and the science of worldly<br>concerns, how could such calamity at all come? O Pandu, O king, where art<br>thou? Why sufferest thou quietly thy good children to be thus sent into<br>exile, defeated at dice? O Sahadeva, desist from going. Thou art my<br>dearest child, dearer, O son of Madri, than my body itself. Forsake me<br>not. It behoveth thee to have some kindness for me. Bound by the ties of<br>virtue, let these thy brothers go. But then, earn thou that virtue which<br>springeth from waiting upon me.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"The Pandavas then consoled their weeping mother<br>and with hearts plunged in grief set out for the woods. And Vidura<br>himself also much afflicted, consoling the distressed Kunti with reasons,<br>and led her slowly to his house. And the ladies of Dhritarashtra's house,<br>hearing everything as it happened, viz., the exile (of the Pandavas) and<br>the dragging of Krishna into the assembly where the princes had gambled,<br>loudly wept censuring the Kauravas. And the ladies of the royal household<br>also sat silent for a long time, covering their lotus-like faces with<br>their fair hands. And king Dhritarashtra also thinking of the dangers<br>that threatened his sons, became a prey to anxiety and could not enjoy<br>peace of mind. And anxiously meditating on everything, and with mind<br>deprived of its equanimity through grief, he sent a messenger unto<br>Vidura, saying, 'Let Kshatta come to me without a moment's delay.'<br><br>"At this summons, Vidura quickly came to Dhritarashtra's palace. And as<br>soon as he came, the monarch asked him with great anxiety how the<br>Pandavas had left Hastinapore."
