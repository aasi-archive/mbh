                            Vaisampayana said,&#8212;that chastiser of all foes then vanquished king<br>Srenimat of the country of Kumara, and then Vrihadvala, the king of<br>Kosala. Then the foremost of the sons of Pandu, by performing feats<br>excelling in fierceness, defeated the virtuous and mighty king<br>Dirghayaghna of Ayodhya. And the exalted one then subjugated the country<br>of Gopalakaksha and the northern Kosalas and also the king of Mallas. And<br>the mighty one, arriving then in the moist region at the foot of the<br>Himalayas soon brought the whole country under his sway. And that bull of<br>Bharata race brought under control in this way diverse countries. And<br>endued with great energy and in strength the foremost of all strong men,<br>the son of Pandu next conquered the country of Bhallata, as also the<br>mountain of Suktimanta that was by the side of Bhallata. Then Bhima of<br>terrible prowess and long arms, vanquishing in battle the unretreating<br>Suvahu the king of Kasi, brought him under complete sway. Then that bull<br>among the sons of Pandu overcame in battle, by sheer force, the great<br>king Kratha reigning in the region lying about Suparsa. Then the hero of<br>great energy vanquished the Matsya and the powerful Maladas and the<br>country called Pasubhumi that was without fear or oppression of any kind.<br>And the long-armed hero then, coming from that land, conquered Madahara,<br>Mahidara, and the Somadheyas, and turned his steps towards the north. And<br>the mighty son of Kunti then subjugated, by sheer force, the country<br>called Vatsabhumi, and the king of the Bhargas, as also the ruler of the<br>Nishadas and Manimat and numerous other kings. Then Bhima, with scarcely<br>any degree of exertion and very soon, vanquished the southern Mallas and<br>the Bhagauanta mountains. And the hero next vanquished, by policy alone,<br>the Sarmakas and the Varmakas. And that tiger among men then defeated<br>with comparative ease that lord of earth, Janaka the king of the Videhas.<br>And the hero then subjugated strategically the Sakas and the barbarians<br>living in that part of the country. And the son of Pandu, sending forth<br>expeditions from Videha, conquered the seven kings of the Kiratas living<br>about the Indra mountain. The mighty hero then, endued with abundant<br>energy, vanquished in battle the Submas and the Prasuhmas. And winning<br>them over to his side, the son of Kunti, possessed of great strength,<br>marched against Magadha. On his way he subjugated the monarchs known by<br>the names of Danda and Dandadhara, And accompanied by those monarchs, the<br>son of Pandu marched against Girivraja. After bringing the son of<br>Jarasandha under his sway by conciliation and making him pay tribute, the<br>hero then accompanied by the monarchs he had vanquished, marched against<br>Kansa. And making the earth tremble by means of his troops consisting of<br>the four kinds of forces, the foremost of the Pandavas then encountered<br>Karna that slayer of foes. And, O Bharata, having subjugated Karna and<br>brought him under his sway, the mighty hero then vanquished the powerful<br>king of the mountainous regions. And the son of Pandu then slew in a<br>fierce encounter, by the strength of his arms, the mighty king who dwelt<br>in Madagiri. And the Pandava then, O king, subjugated in battle those<br>strong and brave heroes of fierce prowess, viz., the heroic and mighty<br>Vasudeva, the king of Pundra and king Mahaujah who reigned in<br>Kausika-kachchha, and then attacked the king of Vanga. And having<br>vanquished Samudrasena and king Chandrasena and Tamralipta, and also the<br>king of the Karvatas and the ruler of the Suhmas, as also the kings that<br>dwelt on the sea-shore, that bull among the Bharatas then conquered all<br>Mlechchha tribes. The mighty son of the wind-god having thus conquered<br>various countries, and exacting tributes from them all advanced towards<br>Lohity. And the son of Pandu then made all the Mlechchha kings dwelling<br>in the marshy regions on the sea-coast, pay tributes and various kinds of<br>wealth, and sandal wood and aloes, and clothes and gems, and pearls and<br>blankets and gold and silver and valuable corals. The Mlechchha kings<br>showered upon the illustrious son of Kunti a thick downpour of wealth<br>consisting of coins and gems counted by hundreds of millions. Then<br>returning to Indraprastha, Bhima of terrible prowess offered the whole of<br>that wealth unto king Yudhisthira the just."
