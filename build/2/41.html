                            "Sisupala said,&#8212;"That mighty king Jarasandha who desired not to fight<br>with Krishna, saying 'He is a slave,' was worthy of my greatest esteem.<br>Who will regard as praiseworthy the act which was done by Kesava, as also<br>by Bhima and Arjuna, in the matter of Jarasandha's death? Entering by an<br>improper gate, disguised as a Brahmana, thus Krishna observed the<br>strength of king Jarasandha. And when that monarch offered at first unto<br>this wretch water to wash his feet, it was then that he denied his<br>Brahmanahood from seeming motives of virtue. And when Jarasandha, O thou<br>of the Kuru race, asked Krishna and Bhima and Dhananjaya to eat, it was<br>this Krishna that refused that monarch's request. If this one is the lord<br>of the universe, as this fool representeth him to be, why doth he not<br>regard himself as a Brahmana? This, however, surpriseth me greatly that<br>though thou leadest the Pandavas away from the path of the wise, they yet<br>regard thee as honest. Or, perhaps, this is scarcely a matter of surprise<br>in respect of those that have thee, O Bharata, womanish in disposition<br>and bent down with age, for their counsellor in everything."<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;Hearing these words of Sisupala, harsh both in<br>import and sound, that foremost of mighty men, Bhimasena endued with<br>energy became angry. And his eyes, naturally large and expanding and like<br>unto lotus leaves became still more extended and red as copper under the<br>influence of that rage. And the assembled monarchs beheld on his forehead<br>three lines of wrinkles like the Ganga of treble currents on the<br>treble-peaked mountain. When Bhimasena began to grind his teeth in rage,<br>the monarchs beheld his face resembling that of Death himself, at the end<br>of the Yuga, prepared to swallow every creature. And as the hero endued<br>with great energy of mind was about to leap up impetuously, the<br>mighty-armed Bhishma caught him like Mahadeva seizing Mahasena (the<br>celestial generalissimo). And, O Bharata, Bhima's wrath was soon appeased<br>by Bhishma, the grand-sire of the Kurus, with various kinds of counsel.<br>And Bhima, that chastiser of foes, could not disobey Bhishma's words,<br>like the ocean that never transgresseth (even when swollen with the<br>waters of the rainy season) its continents. But, O king, even though<br>Bhima was angry, the brave Sisupala depending on his own manhood, did not<br>tremble in fear. And though Bhima was leaping up impetuously every<br>moment, Sisupala bestowed not a single thought on him, like a lion that<br>recks not a little animal in rage. The powerful king of Chedi, beholding<br>Bhima of terrible prowess in such rage, laughingly said,&#8212;'Release him, O<br>Bhishma! Let all the monarchs behold him scorched by my prowess like an<br>insect in fire.' Hearing these words of the ruler of the Chedis, Bhishma,<br>that foremost of the Kurus and chief of all intelligent men, spoke unto<br>Bhima these words."
