                            (Rajasuyika Parva)<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"in consequence of the protection afforded by<br>Yudhisthira the just, and of the truth which he ever cherished in his<br>behaviour, as also of the check under which he kept all foes, the<br>subjects of that virtuous monarch were all engaged in their respective<br>avocations. And by reason of the equitable taxation and the virtuous rule<br>of the monarch, clouds in his kingdom poured as much rain as the people<br>desired, and the cities and the town became highly prosperous. Indeed as<br>a consequence of the monarch's acts; every affair of the kingdom,<br>especially cattle bleeding, agriculture and trade prospered highly. O<br>king, during those days even robbers and cheats never spoke lies amongst<br>themselves, nor they that were the favourites of the monarch. There were<br>no droughts and floods and plagues and fires and premature deaths in<br>those days of Yudhishthira devoted to virtue. And it was only for doing<br>agreeable services, or for worshipping, or for offering tributes that<br>would not impoverish, that other kings used to approach Yudhisthira (and<br>not for hostility or battle.) The large treasure room of the king became<br>so much filled with hoards of wealth virtuously obtained that it could<br>not be emptied even in a hundred years. And the son of Kunti,<br>ascertaining the state of his treasury and the extent of his possessions,<br>fixed his heart upon the celebration of a sacrifice. His friends and<br>officers, each separately and all together, approaching him said,&#8212;'The<br>time hath come, O exalted one, for thy sacrifice. Let arrangements,<br>therefore, be made without loss of time.' While they were thus talking,<br>Hari (Krishna), that omniscient and ancient one, that soul of the Vedas,<br>that invincible one as described by those that have knowledge, that<br>foremost of all lasting existences in the universe, that origin of all<br>things, as also that in which all things come to be dissolved, that lord<br>of the past, the future, and the present Kesava&#8212;the slayer of Kesi, and<br>the bulwark of all Vrishnis and the dispeller of all fear in times of<br>distress and the smiter of all foes, having appointed Vasudeva to the<br>command of the (Yadava) army, and bringing with him for the king<br>Yudhishthira just a large mass of treasure; entered that excellent city<br>of cities. Khandava, himself surrounded by a mighty host and filling the<br>atmosphere with the rattle of his chariot-wheels. And Madhava, that tiger<br>among men enhancing that limitless mass of wealth the Pandavas had by<br>that inexhaustible ocean of gems he had brought, enhanced the sorrows of<br>the enemies of the Pandavas. The capital of the Bharata was gladdened by<br>Krishna's presence just as a dark region is rendered joyful by the sun or<br>a region of still air by a gentle breeze. Approaching him joyfully and<br>receiving him with due respect, Yudhishthira enquired of his welfare. And<br>after Krishna had been seated at ease, that bull among men, the son of<br>Pandu, with Dhaumya and Dwaipayana and the other sacrificial priests and<br>with Bhima and Arjuna and the twins, addressed Krishna thus,&#8212;<br><br>'O Krishna it is for thee that the whole earth is under my sway. And, O<br>thou of the Vrishni race, it is through thy grace that vast wealth had<br>been got by me. And, O son of Devaki, O Madhava, I desire to devote that<br>wealth according to the ordinance, unto superior Brahmanas and the<br>carrier of sacrificial libations. And, O thou of the Dasarha race, it<br>behoveth thee, O thou of mighty arms, to grant me permission to celebrate<br>a sacrifice along with thee and my younger brothers. Therefore, O<br>Govinda, O thou of long arms, install thyself at that sacrifice; for, O<br>thou of the Dasarha race, if thou performed the sacrifice, I shall be<br>cleansed of sin. Or, O exalted one, grant permission for myself being<br>installed at the sacrifice along with these my younger brothers, for<br>permitted by thee, O Krishna. I shall be able to enjoy the fruit of an<br>excellent sacrifice.<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Unto Yudhisthira after he had said this,<br>Krishna, extolling his virtues, said.&#8212;'Thou, O tiger among kings,<br>deservest imperial dignity. Let, therefore, the great sacrifice be<br>performed by thee. And if thou performest that sacrifice an obtainest its<br>fruit we all shall regard ourselves as crowned with success. I am always<br>engaged in seeking good. Perform thou then the sacrifice thou desirest.<br>Employ me also in some office for that purpose, for I should obey all thy<br>commands. Yudhisthira replied&#8212;O Krishna, my resolve is already crowned<br>with fruit, and success also is surely mine, when thou, O Harishikesa,<br>hast arrived here agreeably to my wish!'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Commanded by Krishna, the son of Pandu along<br>with his brothers set himself upon collecting the materials for the<br>performance of the Rajasuya sacrifice. And that chastiser of all foes,<br>the son of Pandu, then commanded Sahadeva that foremost of all warriors<br>and all ministers also, saying,&#8212;Let persons be appointed to collect<br>without loss of time, all those articles which the Brahmanas have<br>directed as necessary for the performance of this sacrifice, and all<br>materials and auspicious necessaries that Dhaumya may order as required<br>for it, each of the kind needed and one after another in due order. Let<br>Indrasena and Visoka and Puru with Arjuna for his charioteer be engaged<br>to collect food if they are to please me. Let these foremost of the Kurus<br>also gather every article of agreeable taste and smell that may delight<br>and attract the hearts of the Brahmanas.'<br><br>"Simultaneously with these words of king Yudhisthira the just, Sahadeva<br>that foremost of warriors, having accomplished everything, represented<br>the matter to the king. And Dwaipayana, O king, then appointed as<br>sacrificial priests exalted Brahmanas that were like the Vedas themselves<br>in embodied forms. The son of Satyavati became himself the Brahma of that<br>sacrifice. And that bull of the Dhananjaya race, Susaman, became the<br>chanter of the Vedic (Sama) hymns. Yajnavalkya devoted to Brahma became<br>the Adhyaryu, and Paila&#8212;the son of Vasu and Dhaumya became the Hotris.<br>And O bull of the Bharata race, the disciples and the sons of these men,<br>all well-acquainted with the Vedas and the branches of the Vedas, became<br>Hotragts. And all of them, having uttered benedictions and recited the<br>object of the sacrifice, worshipped, according to the ordinance the large<br>sacrificial compound. Commanded by the Brahmanas, builders and artificers<br>erected numerous edifices there that were spacious and well-perfumed like<br>unto the temples of the gods. After these were finished, that best of<br>kings and that bull among men Yudhishthira. commanded his chief adviser<br>Sahadeva, saying,&#8212;'Despatch thou, without loss of time, messengers<br>endued with speed to invite all to the sacrifice. And Sahadeva, hearing<br>these words of the king, despatched messengers telling them,&#8212;'Invite ye<br>all the Brahmanas in the kingdom and all the owners of land (Kshatriyas)<br>and all the Vaisyas and also all the respectable Sudras, and bring them<br>hither!'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Endued with speed, these messengers then, thus<br>commanded, invited everybody according to the orders of the Pandava,<br>without losing any time, and brought with them many persons, both friends<br>and strangers. Then, O Bharata, the Brahmanas at the proper time<br>installed Yudhishthira the son of Kunti at the Rajasuya sacrifice. And<br>after the ceremony of installation was over, that foremost of men, the<br>virtuous king Yudhishthira the just like the god Dharma himself in human<br>frame, entered the sacrificial compound, surrounded by thousands of<br>Brahmanas and his brothers and the relatives and friends and counsellors,<br>and by a large number of Kshatriya kings who had come from various<br>countries, and by the officers of State. Numerous Brahmanas, well-skilled<br>in all branches of knowledge and versed in the Vedas and their several<br>branches, began to pour in from various countries. Thousands of<br>craftsmen, at the command of king Yudhishthira the just, erected for<br>those Brahmanas with their attendants separate habitations well-provided<br>with food and clothes and the fruits and flowers of every season. And, O<br>king, duly worshipped by the monarch the Brahmanas continued to reside<br>there passing their time in conversation on diverse topics and beholding<br>the performances of actors and dancers. And the clamour of high-souled<br>Brahmanas, cheerfully eating and talking, was heard there without<br>intermission. 'Give,' and 'Eat' were the words that were heard there<br>incessantly and every day. And, O Bharata, king Yudhishthira the just<br>gave unto each of those Brahmanas thousands of kine and beds and gold<br>coins and damsels.<br><br>Thus commenced on earth the sacrifice of that unrivalled hero, the<br>illustrious son of Pandu, like the sacrifice in heaven of Sakra himself.<br>Then that bull among men, king Yudhishthira despatched Nakula the son of<br>Pandu unto Hastinapura to bring Bhishma and Drona, Dhritarashtra and<br>Vidura and Kripa and those amongst his cousins that were well-disposed<br>towards him."
