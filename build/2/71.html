                            "Karna said,&#8212;'We have never heard of such an act (as this one of<br>Draupadi), performed by any of the women noted in this world for their<br>beauty. When the sons of both Pandu and Dhritarashtra were excited with<br>wrath, this Draupadi became unto the sons of Pandu as their salvation.<br>Indeed the princess of Panchala, becoming as a boat unto the sons of<br>Pandu who were sinking in a boatless ocean of distress, hath brought them<br>in safety to the shore.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Hearing these words of Karna in the midst of<br>the Kurus,&#8212;viz., that the sons of Pandu were saved by their wife,&#8212;the<br>angry Bhimasena in great affliction said (unto Arjuna),&#8212;'O Dhananjaya,<br>it hath been said by Devala three lights reside in every person, viz.,<br>offspring, acts and learning, for from these three hath sprung creation.<br>When life becometh extinct and the body becometh impure and is cast off<br>by relatives, these three become of service to every person. But the<br>light that is in us hath been dimmed by this act of insult to our wife.<br>How, O Arjuna, can a son born from this insulted wife of ours prove<br>serviceable to us?<br><br>"Arjuna replied,&#8212;'Superior persons, O Bharata, never prate about the<br>harsh words that may or may not be uttered by inferior men. Persons that<br>have earned respect for themselves, even if they are able to retaliate,<br>remember not the acts of hostility done by their enemies, but, on the<br>other hand, treasure up only their good deeds.'<br><br>'Bhima said,&#8212;'Shall I, O king, slay, without loss of time all these foes<br>assembled together, even here, or shall I destroy them, O Bharata, by the<br>roots, outside this palace? Or, what need is there of words or of<br>command? I shall slay all these even now, and rule thou the whole earth,<br>O king, without a rival. And saying this, Bhima with his younger<br>brothers, like a lion in the midst of a herd of inferior animals,<br>repeatedly cast his angry glances around. But Arjuna, however, of white<br>deeds, with appealing looks began to pacify his elder brother. And the<br>mighty-armed hero endued with great prowess began to burn with the fire<br>of his wrath. And, O king, this fire began to issue out of Vrikodara's<br>ears and other senses with smoke and sparks and flames. And his face<br>became terrible to behold in consequence of his furrowed brows like those<br>of Yama himself at the time of the universal destruction. Then<br>Yudhishthira forbade the mighty hero, embracing him with his arms and<br>telling him 'Be not so. Stay in silence and peace.' And having pacified<br>the mighty-armed one with eyes red in wrath, the king approached his<br>uncle Dhritarashtra, with hands joined in entreaty."
