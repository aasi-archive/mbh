                            Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"then, O king, Yudhishthira, having approached and<br>worshipped his grandfather and his preceptor, addressed Bhishma and Drona<br>and Kripa and the son of Drona and Duryyodhana and Vivingsati, and<br>said,&#8212;'Help me ye all in the mater of this sacrifice. This large<br>treasure that is here is yours. Consult ye with one another and guide me<br>as ye desire.<br><br>"The eldest of the sons of Pandu, who had been installed at the<br>sacrifice, having said this unto all, appointed every one of them to<br>suitable offices. He appointed Dussasana to superintend the department of<br>food and other enjoyable articles. Aswatthama was asked to attend on the<br>Brahmanas. Sanjaya was appointed to offer return-worship unto the kings.<br>Bhishma and Drona, both endued with great intelligence, were appointed to<br>see what was done and what was left undone. And the king appointed Kripa<br>to look after the diamonds and gold and the pearls and gems, as also<br>after the distribution of gifts to Brahmanas. And so other tigers among<br>men were appointed to similar offices. Valhika and Dhritarashtra and<br>Somadatta and Jayadratha, brought thither by Nakula, went about, enjoying<br>themselves as lords of the sacrifice. Vidura otherwise called Kshatta,<br>conversant with every rule of morality, became the disburser. Duryyodhana<br>became the receiver of the tributes that were brought by the kings.<br>Krishna who was himself the centre of all worlds and round whom moved<br>every creature, desirous of acquiring excellent fruits, was engaged at<br>his own will in washing the feet of the Brahmanas.<br><br>"And desirous of beholding that sacrificial mansion, as also king<br>Yudhishthira the just, none came there with tribute less than a thousand<br>(in number, weight or measure). Everyone honoured the king Yudhishthira<br>the just with large presents of jewels. And each of the kings made a<br>present of his wealth, flattering himself with the proud belief that the<br>jewels he gave would enable the Kuru king Yudhisthira to complete his<br>sacrifice. And, O monarch, the sacrificial compound of the illustrious<br>son of Kunti looked extremely handsome&#8212;with the multitude of palaces<br>built so as to last for ever and crowded with guards and warriors. These<br>were so high that their tops touched the cars of the gods that came to<br>behold that sacrifice; as also with the cars themselves of the<br>celestials, and with the dwelling of the Brahmanas and the mansions made<br>there for the kings resembling the cars of the celestials and adorned<br>with gems and filled with every kind of wealth, and lastly with crowds of<br>the kings that came there all endued with beauty and wealth. Yudhisthira,<br>as though vying with Varuna himself in wealth, commenced the sacrifice<br>(of Rajasuya) distinguished by six fires and large gifts to Brahmanas.<br>The King gratified everybody with presents of great value and indeed with<br>every kind of object that one could desire. With abundance of rice and of<br>every kind of food, as also with a mass of jewels brought as tribute,<br>that vast concourse consisted of persons every one of whom was fed to the<br>full. The gods also were gratified at the sacrifice by the Ida, clarified<br>butter, Homa and libations poured by the great Rishis versed in mantras<br>and pronunciation. Like the gods, the Brahmanas also were gratified with<br>the sacrificial gifts and food and great wealth. And all the other orders<br>of men also were gratified at that sacrifice and filled with joy."
