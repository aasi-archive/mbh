                            (Lokapala Sabhakhayana Parva)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"While the illustrious Pandavas were seated in that<br>Sabha along with the principal Gandharvas, there came, O Bharata, unto<br>that assembly the celestial Rishi Narada, conversant with the Vedas and<br>Upanishadas, worshipped by the celestials acquainted with histories and<br>Puranas, well-versed in all that occurred in ancient kalpas (cycles),<br>conversant with Nyaya (logic) and the truth of moral science, possessing<br>a complete knowledge of the six Angas (viz., pronunciation, grammar,<br>prosody, explanation of basic terms, description of religious rites, and<br>astronomy). He was a perfect master in reconciling contradictory texts<br>and differentiating in applying general principles to particular cases,<br>as also in interpreting contraries by reference to differences in<br>situation, eloquent, resolute, intelligent, possessed of powerful memory.<br>He was acquainted with the science of morals and politics, learned,<br>proficient in distinguishing inferior things from superior ones, skilled<br>in drawing inference from evidence, competent to judge of the correctness<br>or incorrectness of syllogistic statements consisting of five<br>propositions. He was capable of answering successively Vrihaspati himself<br>while arguing, with definite conclusions properly framed about religion,<br>wealth, pleasure and salvation, of great soul and beholding this whole<br>universe, above, below, and around, as if it were present before his<br>eyes. He was master of both the Sankhya and Yoga systems of philosophy,<br>ever desirous of humbling the celestials and Asuras by fomenting quarrels<br>among them, conversant with the sciences of war and treaty, proficient in<br>drawing conclusions by judging of things not within direct ken, as also<br>in the six sciences of treaty, war, military campaigns, maintenance of<br>posts against the enemy and stratagems by ambuscades and reserves. He was<br>a thorough master of every branch of learning, fond of war and music,<br>incapable of being repulsed by any science or any course, of action, and<br>possessed of these and numberless other accomplishments. The Rishi,<br>having wandered over the different worlds, came into that Sabha. And the<br>celestial Rishi  of immeasurable splendour, endued with great energy was<br>accompanied, O monarch, by Parijata and the intelligent Raivata and<br>Saumya and Sumukha. Possessing the speed of the mind, the Rishi came<br>thither and was filled with gladness upon beholding the Pandavas. The<br>Brahmana, on arriving there, paid homage unto Yudhishthira by uttering<br>blessings on him and wishing him victory. Beholding the learned Rishi<br>arrive, the eldest of the Pandavas, conversant with all rules of duty,<br>quickly stood up with his younger brothers. Bending low with humility,<br>the monarch cheerfully saluted the Rishi, and gave with due ceremonies a<br>befitting seat unto him. The king also gave him kine and the usual<br>offerings of the Arghya including honey and the other ingredients.<br>Conversant with every duty the monarch also worshipped the Rishi with<br>gems and jewels with a whole heart. Receiving that worship from<br>Yudhishthira in proper form, the Rishi became gratified. Thus worshipped<br>by the Pandavas and the great Rishis, Narada possessing a complete<br>mastery over the Vedas, said unto Yudhishthira the following words<br>bearing upon religion, wealth, pleasures and salvation.<br><br>"Narada said&#8212;'Is the wealth thou art earning being spent on proper<br>objects? Doth thy mind take pleasure in virtue? Art thou enjoying the<br>pleasures of life? Doth not thy mind sink under their weight? O chief of<br>men, continuest thou in the noble conduct consistent with religion and<br>wealth practised by thy ancestors towards the three classes of subjects,<br>(viz., good, indifferent, and bad)? Never injurest thou religion for the<br>sake of wealth, or both religion and wealth for the sake of pleasure that<br>easily seduces? O thou foremost of victorious men ever devoted to the<br>good of all, conversant as thou art with the timeliness of everything,<br>followest thou religion, wealth, pleasure and salvation dividing thy time<br>judiciously? O sinless one, with the six attributes of kings (viz.,<br>cleverness of speech, readiness in providing means, intelligence in<br>dealing with the foe, memory, and acquaintance with morals and politics),<br>dost thou attend to the seven means (viz., sowing dissensions,<br>chastisement, conciliation, gifts, incantations, medicine and magic)?<br>Examinest thou also, after a survey of thy own strength and weakness, the<br>fourteen possessions of thy foes? These are the country, forts, cars,<br>elephants, cavalry, foot-soldiers, the principal officials of state, the<br>zenana, food supply, computations of the army and income, the religious<br>treatises in force, the accounts of state, the revenue, wine-shops and<br>other secret enemies. Attendest thou to the eight occupations (of<br>agriculture, trade, &c), having examined, O thou foremost of victorious<br>monarchs, thy own and thy enemy's means, and having made peace with thy<br>enemies? O bull of the Bharata race, thy seven principal officers of<br>state (viz., the governor of the citadel, the commander of forces, the<br>chief judge, the general in interior command, the chief priest, the chief<br>physician, and the chief astrologer), have not, I hope, succumbed to the<br>influence of thy foes, nor have they, I hope, become idle in consequence<br>of the wealth they have earned? They are, I hope, all obedient to thee.<br>Thy counsels, I hope, are never divulged by thy trusted spies in<br>disguise, by thyself or by thy ministers? Thou ascertainest, I hope, what<br>thy friends, foes and strangers are about? Makest thou peace and makest<br>thou war at proper times? Observest thou neutrality towards strangers and<br>persons that are neutral towards thee? And, O hero, hast thou made<br>persons like thyself, persons that are old, continent in behaviour,<br>capable of understanding what should be done and what should not, pure as<br>regards birth and blood, and devoted to thee, thy ministers? O Bharata,<br>the victories of kings can be attributed to good counsels. O child, is<br>thy kingdom protected by ministers learned in Sastras, keeping their<br>counsels close? Are thy foes unable to injure it? Thou hast not become<br>the slave of sleep? Wakest thou at the proper time? Conversant with<br>pursuits yielding profit, thinkest thou, during the small hours of night,<br>as to what thou shouldst do and what thou shouldst not do the next day?<br>Thou settlest nothing alone, nor takest counsels with many? The counsels<br>thou hast resolved upon, do not become known all over thy kingdom?<br>Commencest thou soon to accomplish measures of great utility that are<br>easy of accomplishment? Such measures are never obstructed? Keepest thou<br>the agriculturists not out of thy sight? They do not fear to approach<br>thee? Achievest thou thy measures through persons that are trusted<br>incorruptible, and possessed of practical experience? And, O brave king.<br>I hope, people only know the measures already accomplished by thee and<br>those that have been partially accomplished and are awaiting completion,<br>but not those that are only in contemplation and uncommenced? Have<br>experienced teachers capable of explaining the causes of things and<br>learned in the science of morals and every branch of learning, been<br>appointed to instruct the princes and the chiefs of the army? Buyest thou<br>a single learned man by giving in exchange a thousand ignorant<br>individuals? The man that is learned conferreth the greatest benefit in<br>seasons of distress. Are thy forts always filled with treasure, food,<br>weapons, water, engines and instruments, as also with engineers and<br>bowmen? Even a single minister that is intelligent, brave, with his<br>passions under complete control, and possessed of wisdom and judgment, is<br>capable of conferring the highest prosperity on a king or a king's son. I<br>ask thee, therefore, whether there is even one such minister with thee?<br>Seekest thou to know everything about the eighteen Tirthas of the foe and<br>fifteen of thy own by means of three and three spies all unacquainted<br>with one another? O slayer of all foes, watchest thou all thy enemies<br>with care and attention, and unknown to them? Is the priest thou<br>honourest, possessed of humility, and purity of blood, and renown, and<br>without jealousy and illiberality? Hath any well-behaved, intelligent,<br>and guileless Brahmana, well-up in the ordinance, been employed by thee<br>in the performance of thy daily rites before the sacred fire, and doth he<br>remind thee in proper time as to when thy homa should be performed? Is<br>the astrologer thou hast employed skilled in reading physiognomy, capable<br>of interpreting omens, and competent to neutralise the effect of the<br>disturbances of nature? Have respectable servants been employed by thee<br>in offices that are respectable, indifferent ones in indifferent offices,<br>and low ones in offices that are low? Hast thou appointed to high offices<br>ministers that are guileless and of well conduct for generations and<br>above the common run? Oppressest thou not thy people with cruel and<br>severe punishment? And, O bull of the Bharata race, do thy ministers rule<br>thy kingdom under thy orders? Do thy ministers ever slight thee like<br>sacrificial priests slighting men that are fallen (and incapable of<br>performing any more sacrifices) or like wives slighting husbands that are<br>proud and incontinent in their behaviour? Is the commander of thy forces<br>possessed of sufficient confidence, brave, intelligent, patient,<br>well-conducted, of good birth, devoted to thee, and competent? Treatest<br>thou with consideration and regard the chief officers of thy army that<br>are skilled in every kind of welfare, are forward, well-behaved, and<br>endued with prowess? Givest thou to thy troops their sanctioned rations<br>and pay in the appointed time? Thou dost not oppress them by withholding<br>these? Knowest thou that the misery caused by arrears of pay and<br>irregularity in the distribution of rations driveth the troops to mutiny,<br>and that is called by the learned to be one of the greatest of mischiefs?<br>Are all the principal high-born men devoted to thee, and ready with<br>cheerfulness to lay down their lives in battle for thy sake? I hope no<br>single individual of passions uncontrolled is ever permitted by thee to<br>rule as he likes a number of concerns at the same time appertaining to<br>the army? Is any servant of thine, who hath accomplished well a<br>particular business by the employment of special ability, disappointed in<br>obtaining from thee a little more regard, and an increase of food and<br>pay? I hope thou rewardest persons of learning and humility, and skill in<br>every kind of knowledge with gifts of wealth and honour proportionate to<br>their qualifications. Dost thou support, O bull in the Bharata race, the<br>wives and children of men that have given their lives for thee and have<br>been distressed on thy account? Cherishest thou, O son of Pritha, with<br>paternal affection the foe that hath been weakened, or him also that hath<br>sought thy shelter, having been vanquished in battle? O lord of Earth,<br>art thou equal unto all men, and can every one approach thee without<br>fear, as if thou wert their mother and father? And O bull of the Bharata<br>race, marchest thou, without loss of time, and reflecting well upon three<br>kinds of forces, against thy foe when thou hearest that he is in<br>distress? O subjugator of all foes beginnest thou thy march when the time<br>cometh, having taken into consideration all the omens you might see, the<br>resolutions thou hast made, and that the ultimate victory depends upon<br>the twelve mandalas (such as reserves, ambuscades, &c, and payment of pay<br>to the troops in advance)? And, O persecutor of all foes, givest thou<br>gems and jewels, unto the principal officers of enemy, as they deserve,<br>without thy enemy's knowledge? O son of Pritha, seekest thou to conquer<br>thy incensed foes that are slaves to their passions, having first<br>conquered thy own soul and obtained the mastery over thy own senses?<br>Before thou marchest out against thy foes, dost thou properly employ the<br>four arts of reconciliation, gift (of wealth) producing disunion, and<br>application of force? O monarch, goest thou out against thy enemies,<br>having first strengthened thy own kingdom? And having gone out against<br>them, exertest thou to the utmost to obtain victory over them? And having<br>conquered them, seekest thou to protect them with care? Are thy army<br>consisting of four kinds of forces, viz., the regular troops, the allies,<br>the mercenaries, and the irregulars, each furnished with the eight<br>ingredients, viz., cars, elephants, horses, offices, infantry,<br>camp-followers, spies possessing a thorough knowledge of the country, and<br>ensigns led out against thy enemies after having been well trained by<br>superior officers? O oppressor of all foes, O great king, I hope thou<br>slayest thy foes without regarding their seasons of reaping and of<br>famine? O king, I hope thy servants and agents in thy own kingdom and in<br>the kingdoms of thy foes continue to look after their respective duties<br>and to protect one another. O monarch, I hope trusted servants have been<br>employed by thee to look after thy food, the robes thou wearest and the<br>perfumes thou usest. I hope, O king, thy treasury, barns, stables<br>arsenals, and women's apartments, are all protected by servants devoted<br>to thee and ever seeking thy welfare. I hope, O monarch, thou protectest<br>first thyself from thy domestic and public servants, then from those<br>servants of thy relatives and from one another. Do thy servants, O king,<br>ever speak to thee in the forenoon regarding thy extravagant expenditure<br>in respect of thy drinks, sports, and women? Is thy expenditure always<br>covered by a fourth, a third or a half of thy income? Cherishest thou<br>always, with food and wealth, relatives, superiors, merchants, the aged,<br>and other proteges, and the distressed? Do the accountants and clerks<br>employed by thee in looking after thy income and expenditure, always<br>appraise thee every day in the forenoon of thy income and expenditure?<br>Dismissest thou without fault servants accomplished in business and<br>popular and devoted to thy welfare? O Bharata, dost thou employ superior,<br>indifferent, and low men, after examining them well in offices they<br>deserve? O monarch, employest thou in thy business persons that are<br>thievish or open to temptation, or hostile, or minors? Persecutest thou<br>thy kingdom by the help of thievish or covetous men, or minors, or women?<br>Are the agriculturists in thy kingdom contented. Are large tanks and<br>lakes constructed all over thy kingdom at proper distances, without<br>agriculture being in thy realm entirely dependent on the showers of<br>heaven? Are the agriculturists in thy kingdom wanting in either seed or<br>food? Grantest thou with kindness loans (of seed-grains) unto the<br>tillers, taking only a fourth in excess of every measure by the hundred?<br>O child, are the four professions of agriculture, trade, cattle-rearing,<br>and lending at interest, carried on by honest men? Upon these O monarch,<br>depends the happiness of thy people. O king, do the five brave and wise<br>men, employed in the five offices of protecting the city, the citadel,<br>the merchants, and the agriculturists, and punishing the criminals,<br>always benefit thy kingdom by working in union with one another? For the<br>protection of thy city, have the villages been made like towns, and the<br>hamlets and outskirts of villages like villages? Are all these entirely<br>under thy supervision and sway? Are thieves and robbers that sack thy<br>town pursued by thy police over the even and uneven parts of thy kingdom?<br>Consolest thou women and are they protected in thy realm? I hope thou<br>placest not any confidence in them, nor divulgest any secret before any<br>of them? O monarch, having heard of any danger and having reflected on it<br>also, liest thou in the inner apartments enjoying every agreeable object?<br>Having slept during the second and the third divisions of the night,<br>thinkest thou of religion and profit in the fourth division wakefully. O<br>son of Pandu, rising from bed at the proper time and dressing thyself<br>well, showest thou thyself to thy people, accompanied by ministers<br>conversant with the auspiciousness or otherwise of moments? O represser<br>of all foes, do men dressed in red and armed with swords and adorned with<br>ornaments stand by thy side to protect thy person? O monarch! behavest<br>thou like the god of justice himself unto those that deserve punishment<br>and those that deserve worship, unto those that are dear to thee and<br>those that thou likest not? O son of Pritha, seekest thou to cure bodily<br>diseases by medicines and fasts, and mental illness with the advice of<br>the aged? I hope that the physicians engaged in looking after thy health<br>are well conversant with the eight kinds of treatment and are all<br>attached and devoted to thee. Happeneth it ever, O monarch, that from<br>covetousness or folly or pride thou failest to decide between the<br>plaintiff and the defendant who have come to thee? Deprivest thou,<br>through covetousness or folly, of their pensions the proteges who have<br>sought thy shelter from trustfulness or love? Do the people that inhabit<br>thy realm, bought by thy foes, ever seek to raise disputes with thee,<br>uniting themselves with one another? Are those amongst thy foes that are<br>feeble always repressed by the help of troops that are strong, by the<br>help of both counsels and troops? Are all the principal chieftains (of<br>thy empire) all devoted to thee? Are they ready to lay down their lives<br>for thy sake, commanded by thee? Dost thou worship Brahmanas and wise men<br>according to their merits in respect of various branches of learning? I<br>tell thee, such worship is without doubt, highly beneficial to thee. Hast<br>thou faith in the religion based on the three Vedas and practised by men<br>who have gone before thee? Dost thou carefully follow the practices that<br>were followed by them? Are accomplished Brahmanas entertained in thy<br>house and in thy presence with nutritive and excellent food, and do they<br>also obtain pecuniary gifts at the conclusion of those feasts? Dost thou,<br>with passions under complete control and with singleness of mind, strive<br>to perform the sacrifices called Vajapeya and Pundarika with their full<br>complement of rites? Bowest thou unto thy relatives and superiors, the<br>aged, the gods, the ascetics, the Brahmanas, and the tall trees (banian)<br>in villages, that are of so much benefit to people? O sinless one,<br>causest thou ever grief or anger in any one? Do priests capable of<br>granting thee auspicious fruits ever stand by thy side? O sinless one,<br>are thy inclinations and practices such as I have described them, and as<br>always enhance the duration of life and spread one's renown and as always<br>help the cause of religion, pleasure, and profit? He who conducteth<br>himself according to this way, never findeth his kingdom distressed or<br>afflicted; and that monarch, subjugating the whole earth, enjoyeth a high<br>degree of felicity. O monarch, I hope, no well-behaved, pure-souled, and<br>respected person is ever ruined and his life taken, on a false charge or<br>theft, by thy ministers ignorant of Sastras and acting from greed? And, O<br>bull among men, I hope thy ministers never from covetousness set free a<br>real thief, knowing him to be such and having apprehended him with the<br>booty about him? O Bharata, I hope, thy ministers are never won over by<br>bribes, nor do they wrongly decide the disputes that arise between the<br>rich and the poor. Dost thou keep thyself free from the fourteen vices of<br>kings, viz., atheism, untruthfulness, anger, incautiousness,<br>procrastination, non-visit to the wise, idleness, restlessness of mind,<br>taking counsels with only one man, consultation with persons unacquainted<br>with the science of profit, abandonment of a settled plan, divulgence of<br>counsels, non-accomplishment of beneficial projects, and undertaking<br>everything without reflection? By these, O king, even monarchs firmly<br>seated on their thrones are ruined. Hath thy study of the Vedas, thy<br>wealth and knowledge of the Sastras and marriage been fruitful?<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;After the Rishi had finished, Yudhishthira<br>asked,&#8212;"How, O Rishi, do the Vedas, wealth, wife, and knowledge of the<br>Sastras bear fruit?"<br><br>"The Rishi answered,&#8212;"The Vedas are said to bear fruit when he that hath<br>studied them performeth the Agnihotra and other sacrifices. Wealth is<br>said to bear fruit when he that hath it enjoyeth it himself and giveth it<br>away in charity. A wife is said to bear fruit when she is useful and when<br>she beareth children. Knowledge of the Sastras is said to bear fruit when<br>it resulteth in humility and good behaviour."<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;The great ascetic Narada, having answered<br>Yudhishthira thus, again asked that just ruler,-"Do the officers of thy<br>government, O king, that are paid from the taxes levied on the community,<br>take only their just dues from the merchants that come to thy territories<br>from distant lands impelled by the desire of gain? Are the merchants, O<br>king, treated with consideration in thy capital and kingdom, capable of<br>bringing their goods thither without being deceived by the false pretexts<br>of (both the buyers and the officers of government)?<br><br>Listenest thou always, O monarch, to the words, fraught with instructions<br>in religion and wealth, of old men acquainted with economic doctrines?<br>Are gifts of honey and clarified butter made to the Brahmanas intended<br>for the increase of agricultural produce, of kine, of fruits and flowers,<br>and for the sake of virtue? Givest thou always, O king, regularly unto<br>all the artisans and artists employed by thee the materials of their<br>works and their wages for periods not more than four months? Examinest<br>thou the works executed by those that are employed by thee, and<br>applaudest thou them before good men, and rewardest thou them, having<br>shewn them proper respect? O bull of the Bharata race, followest thou the<br>aphorisms (of the sage) in respect of every concern particularly those<br>relating to elephants, horses, and cars? O bull of the Bharata race, are<br>the aphorisms relating to the science of arms, as also those that relate<br>to the practice of engines in warfare&#8212;so useful to towns and fortified<br>places, studied in thy court? O sinless one, art thou acquainted with all<br>mysterious incantations, and with the secrets of poisons destructive of<br>all foes? Protectest thou thy kingdom from the fear of fire, of snakes<br>and other animals destructive of life, of disease, and Rakshasas? As<br>acquainted thou art with every duty, cherishest thou like a father, the<br>blind, the dumb, the lame, the deformed, the friendless, and ascetics<br>that have no homes. Hast thou banished these six evils, O monarch, viz.,<br>sleep, idleness, fear, anger, weakness of mind, and procrastination?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;The illustrious bull among the Kurus, having<br>heard these words of that best of Brahmanas, bowed down unto him and<br>worshipped his feet. And gratified with everything he heard, the monarch<br>said unto Narada of celestial form,&#8212;"I shall do all that thou hast<br>directed, for my knowledge hath expanded under thy advice!' Having said<br>this the king acted conformably to that advice, and gained in time the<br>whole Earth bounded by her belt of seas. Narada again spoke,<br>saying,&#8212;"That king who is thus employed in the protection of four<br>orders, Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Sudras, passeth his days<br>here happily and attaineth hereafter to the region of Sakra (heaven).'"
