                            Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Yudhishthira, having heard these words of Narada,<br>began to sigh heavily. And, O Bharata, engaged in his thoughts about the<br>Rajasuya, the king had no peace of mind. Having heard of this glory of<br>the illustrious monarchs (of old) and being certain about the acquisition<br>of regions of felicity by performers of sacrifices in consequence of<br>their sacred deeds, and thinking especially of that royal sage<br>Harischandra who had performed the great sacrifice king Yudhishthira<br>desired to make preparations for the Rajasuya sacrifice. Then worshipping<br>his counsellors and others present at his Sabha, and worshipped by them<br>in return, he began to discuss with them about that sacrifice. Having<br>reflected much, that king of kings, that bull amongst the Kurus, inclined<br>his mind towards making preparations for the Rajasuya. That prince of<br>wonderful energy and prowess, however, reflecting upon virtue and<br>righteousness, again set his heart to find out what would be for the good<br>of all his people. For Yudhishthira, that foremost of all virtuous men,<br>always kind unto his subjects, worked for the good of all without making<br>any distinctions. Indeed, shaking off both anger and arrogance,<br>Yudhishthira always said,&#8212;Give unto each what is due to each,&#8212;and the<br>only sounds that he could hear were,&#8212;Blessed be Dharma! Blessed be<br>Dharma! Yudhishthira! conducting himself thus and giving paternal<br>assurance to everybody, there was none in the kingdom who entertained any<br>hostile feelings towards him. He therefore came to be called Ajatasatru<br>(one with no enemy at all). The king cherished every one as belonging to<br>his family, and Bhima ruled over all justly. Arjuna, used to employing<br>both his hands with equal skill, protected the people from (external)<br>enemies. And the wise Sahadeva administered justice impartially. And<br>Nakula behaved towards all with humility that was natural to him. Owing<br>to all this, the kingdom became free from disputes and fear of every<br>kind. And all the people became attentive to their respective<br>occupations. The rain became so abundant as to leave no room for desiring<br>more; and the kingdom grew in prosperity. And in consequence of the<br>virtues of the king, money-lenders, the articles required for sacrifices,<br>cattle-rearing, tillage, and traders, all and everything grew in<br>prosperity. Indeed, during the reign of Yudhishthira who was ever devoted<br>to truth, there was no extortion, no stringent realisation of arrears of<br>rent, no fear of disease, of fire, or of death by poisoning and<br>incantations, in the kingdom. It was never heard at that time that<br>thieves or cheats or royal favourites ever behaved wrongfully towards the<br>king or towards one another amongst themselves. Kings conquered on the<br>six occasions (of war, treaty, &c.) were wont to wait upon him in order<br>to do good unto the monarch and worship him ever, while the traders of<br>different classes came to pay him the taxes leviable on their respective<br>occupations. And accordingly during the reign of Yudhishthira who was<br>ever devoted to virtue, his dominion grew in prosperity. Indeed, the<br>prosperity of the kingdom was increased not by these alone but even by<br>persons wedded to voluptuousness and indulging in all luxuries to their<br>fill. And the king of kings, Yudhishthira, whose sway extended over all,<br>was possessed of every accomplishment and bore everything with patience.<br>And, O king, whatever countries the celebrated and illustrious monarch<br>conquered, the people everywhere, from Brahmanas to swains, were all more<br>attached to him than to their own fathers and mothers.'<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"King Yudhishthira, then, that foremost of speakers,<br>summoning together his counsellors and brothers, asked them repeatedly<br>about the Rajasuya sacrifice. Those ministers in a body, thus asked by<br>the wise Yudhishthira desirous of performing the sacrifice, then told him<br>these words of grave import,&#8212;'One already in possession of a kingdom<br>desireth all the attributes of an emperor by means of that sacrifice<br>which aideth a king in acquiring the attributes of Varuna. O prince of<br>Kuru race, thy friends think that as thou art worthy of the attributes of<br>an emperor, the time is even come for thee for the performance of the<br>Rajasuya sacrifice. The time for the performance of that sacrifice in<br>which Rishis of austere vows kindle six fires with mantras of the Sama<br>Veda, is come for thee in consequence of thy Kshatriya possessions. At<br>the conclusion of the Rajasuya sacrifice when the performer is installed<br>in the sovereignty of the empire, he is rewarded with the fruits of all<br>sacrifices including the Agnihotra. It is for this that he is called the<br>conqueror of all. Thou art quite able, O strong-armed one, to perform<br>this sacrifice. All of us are obedient to thee. Soon will you be able, O<br>great king, to perform the Rajasuya sacrifice. Therefore, O great king,<br>let thy resolution be taken to perform this sacrifice without further<br>discussion. Thus, spoke unto the king all his friends and counsellors<br>separately and jointly. And, O king, Yudhishthira that slayer of all<br>enemies, having heard these virtuous, bold, agreeable and weighty words<br>of theirs, accepted them mentally. And having heard those words of his<br>friends and counsellors, and knowing his own strength also, the king, O<br>Bharata, repeatedly thought over the matter. After this the intelligent<br>and virtuous Yudhishthira, wise in counsel, again consulted with his<br>brothers, with the illustrious Ritwijas about him, with his ministers and<br>with Dhaumya and Dwaipayana and others.<br><br>'Yudhishthira said,&#8212;"How may this wish that I entertain of performing<br>the excellent sacrifice of Rajasuya that is worthy of an emperor, bear<br>fruit, in consequence of my faith and speech alone.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"O thou of eyes like lotus-petals, thus asked by the<br>king, they replied at that time unto Yudhishthira the just in these<br>words,&#8212;Being conversant with the dictates of morality, thou art, O king,<br>worthy to perform the grand sacrifice of Rajasuya. After the Ritwijas and<br>the Rishis  had told these words unto the king, his ministers and<br>brothers highly approved of the speech. The king, however, possessed of<br>great wisdom, and with mind under complete control, actuated by the<br>desire of doing good unto the world, again resolved the matter in his<br>mind, thinking of his own strength and means, the circumstances of time<br>and place and his income and expenditure. For he knew that the wise never<br>come to grief owing to their always acting after full deliberation.<br>Thinking that the sacrifice should not be commenced, pursuant to his own<br>resolution only, Yudhishthira, carefully bearing upon his shoulder the<br>weight of affairs thought of Krishna that persecutor of all sinners as<br>the fittest person to decide the matter, in as much as he knew him to be<br>the foremost of all persons, possessed of immeasurable energy,<br>strong-armed, without birth but born amongst men from Will alone.<br>Reflecting upon his god-like feats the son of Pandu concluded that there<br>was nothing that was unknown to him, nothing that he could not achieve,<br>and nothing that he could not bear, and Yudhishthira, the son of Pritha,<br>having come to this settled resolution soon sent a messenger unto that<br>master of all beings, conveying through him blessings and speeches such<br>as one senior in age might send to one that is younger. And that<br>messenger riding in a swift car arrived amongst the Yadavas and<br>approached Krishna who was then residing in Dwaravati. And Achyuta<br>(Krishna) hearing that the son of Pritha had become desirous of seeing<br>him, desired to see his cousin. And quickly passing over many regions,<br>being drawn by his own swift horses, Krishna arrived at Indraprastha,<br>accompanied by Indrasena. And having arrived at Indraprastha, Janardana<br>approached Yudhisthira without loss of time. And Yudhisthira received<br>Krishna with paternal-affection, and Bhima also received him likewise.<br>And Janardana then went with a cheerful heart to his father's sister<br>(Kunti). And worshipped then with reverence by the twins, he began to<br>converse cheerfully with his friend Arjuna who was overjoyed at seeing<br>him. And after he had rested awhile in a pleasant apartment and had been<br>fully refreshed, Yudhishthira approached him at his leisure and informed<br>him all about the Rajasuya sacrifice.<br><br>"Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'I have wished to perform the Rajasuya sacrifice.<br>That sacrifice, however, cannot be performed by one's wishing alone to<br>perform it. Thou knowest, O Krishna, even thing about the means by which<br>it may be accomplished. He alone can achieve this sacrifice in whom<br>everything is possible, who is worshipped everywhere and who is the king<br>of kings. My friends and counsellors approaching me have said that I<br>should perform that sacrifice. But, O Krishna, in respect of that matter,<br>thy words shall be my guide. Of counsellers some from friendship do not<br>notice the difficulties; others from motives of self-interest say only<br>what is agreeable. Some again regard that which is beneficial to<br>themselves as worthy of adoption. Men are seen to counsel thus on matters<br>awaiting decision. But thou, O Krishna, art above such motives. Thou hast<br>conquered both desire and anger. It behoveth thee to tell me what is most<br>beneficial to the world."
