                            Janamejaya said,&#8212;"O thou foremost of all conversant with the Vedas, how<br>did that game at dice take place, fraught with such evil to the cousins<br>and through which my grand-sires, the son of Pandu, were plunged into<br>such sorrow? What kings also were present in that assembly, and who<br>amongst them approved of the gambling match and who amongst them forbade<br>it? O sinless one, O chief of regenerate ones, I desire thee to recite in<br>detail all about this, which, indeed, was the cause of the destruction of<br>the world."<br><br>Santi said,&#8212;"Thus addressed by the king, the disciple of Vyasa, endued<br>with great energy and conversant with the entire Vedas, narrated<br>everything that had happened."<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"O best of the Bharatas, O great king, if thou<br>desirest to hear, then listen to me as I narrate to thee everything again<br>in detail.<br><br>"Ascertaining the opinion of Vidura, Dhritarashtra the son of Amvika,<br>calling Duryodhana told him again in private&#8212;'O son of Gandhari, have<br>nothing to do with dice. Vidura doth not speak well of it. Possessed of<br>great wisdom, he will never give me advice that is not for my good. I<br>also regard what Vidura sayeth as exceedingly beneficial for me. Do that,<br>O son, for I regard it all as for thy good also. Indeed, Vidura knoweth<br>with all its mysteries the science (of political morality) that the<br>illustrious and learned and wise Vrihaspati, the celestial Rishi who is<br>the spiritual guide of Vasava&#8212;had unfolded unto the wise chief of the<br>immortals. And O son, I always accept what Vidura adviseth. O king, as<br>the wise Uddhava is ever regarded amongst the Vrishnis, so is Vidura<br>possessed of great intelligence esteemed as the foremost of the Kurus.<br>Therefore, O son, have nothing to do with dice. It is evident that dice<br>soweth dissensions. And dissensions are the ruin of the kingdom.<br>Therefore, O son, abandon this idea of gambling. O son, thou hast<br>obtained from us what, it hath been ordained, a father and a mother<br>should give unto their son, viz., ancestral rank and possessions. Thou<br>art educated and clever in every branch of knowledge, and hast been<br>brought up with affection in thy paternal dwelling. Born the eldest among<br>all thy brothers, living within thy own kingdom, why regardest thou<br>thyself as unhappy? O thou of mighty arms, thou obtainest food and attire<br>of the very best kind and which is not obtainable by ordinary men. Why<br>dost thou grieve yet. O son, O mighty-armed one, ruling thy large<br>ancestral kingdom swelling with people and wealth, thou shinest as<br>splendidly as the chief of the celestials in heaven. Thou art possessed<br>of wisdom. It behoveth thee to tell me what can be the root of this grief<br>that hath made thee so melancholy.<br><br>"Duryodhana replied,&#8212;'I am a sinful wretch, O king, because I eat and<br>dress beholding (the prosperity of the foes). It hath been said that man<br>is a wretch who is not filled with jealousy at the sight of his enemy's<br>prosperity. O exalted one, this kind of prosperity of mine doth not<br>gratify me. Beholding that blazing prosperity of the son of Kunti, I am<br>very much pained. I tell thee strong must be my vitality, in as much as I<br>am living even at the sight of the whole earth owning the sway of<br>Yudhishthira. The Nipas, the Chitrakas, the Kukkuras, the Karaskaras, and<br>the Lauha-janghas are living in the palace of Yudhishthira like bondsmen.<br>The Himavat, the ocean, the regions on the sea-shore, and the numberless<br>other regions that yield jewels and gems, have all acknowledged<br>superiority of the mansion of Yudhishthira in respect of wealth it<br>containeth. And, O Monarch, regarding me as the eldest and entitled to<br>respect, Yudhishthira having received me respectfully, appointed me in<br>receiving the jewels and gems (that were brought as tribute). O Bharata,<br>the limit and the like of the excellent and invaluable jewels that were<br>brought there have not been seen. And O king, my hands were fatigued in<br>receiving that wealth. And when I was tired, they that brought those<br>valuable articles from distant regions used to wait till I was able to<br>resume my labour. Bringing jewels from the lake Vindu, the Asura<br>architect Maya constructed (for the Pandavas) a lake-like surface made of<br>crystal. Beholding the (artificial) lotuses with which it was filled, I<br>mistook it, O king for water. And seeing me draw up my clothes (while<br>about to cross it), Vrikodara (Bhima) laughed at me, regarding me as<br>wanting in jewels and having lost my head at the sight of the affluence<br>of my enemy. If I had the ability, I would, O king, without the loss of a<br>moment, slay Vrikodara for that. But, O monarch, if we endeavour to slay<br>Bhima now, without doubt, ours will be the fate of Sisupala. O Bharata,<br>that insult by the foe burneth me. Once again, O king, beholding a<br>similar lake that is really full of water but which I mistook for a<br>crystal surface, I fell into it. At that, Bhima with Arjuna once more<br>laughed derisively, and Draupadi also accompanied by other females joined<br>in the laughter. That paineth my heart exceedingly. My apparel having<br>been wet, the menials at the command of the king gave me other clothes.<br>That also is my great sorrow. And O king, hear now of another mistake<br>that I speak of. In attempting to pass through what is exactly of the<br>shape of a door but through which there was really no passage, I struck<br>my forehead against stone and injured myself. The twins Nakula and<br>Sahadeva beholding from a distance that I was so hit at the head came and<br>supported me in their arms, expressing great concern for me. And Sahadeva<br>repeatedly told me, as if with a smile,&#8212;'This O king, is the door. Go<br>this way!' And Bhimasena, laughing aloud, addressed me and said,&#8212;'O son<br>of Dhritarashtra, this is the door. And, O king I had not even heard of<br>the names of those gems that I saw in that mansion. And it is for these<br>reasons that my heart so acheth."
