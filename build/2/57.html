                            Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Vidura then, thus commanded against his will by king<br>Dhritarashtra, set out, with the help of horses of high mettle and endued<br>with great speed and strength, and quiet and patient, for the abode of<br>the wise sons of Pandu. Possessed of great intelligence, Vidura proceeded<br>by the way leading to the capital of the Pandavas. And having arrived at<br>the city of king Yudhishthira, he entered it and proceeded towards the<br>palace, worshipped by numberless Brahmanas. And coming to the palace<br>which was even like unto the mansion of Kuvera himself, the virtuous<br>Vidura approached Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma. Then the illustrious<br>Ajamida devoted to truth and having no enemy on earth, reverentially<br>saluted Vidura, and asked him about Dhritarashtra and his sons. And<br>Yudhishthira said, "O Kshatta, thy mind seemeth to be cheerless. Dost<br>thou come here in happiness and peace? The sons of Dhritarashtra, I hope,<br>are obedient to their old father. The people also, I hope, are obedient<br>to Dhritarashtra's rule.'<br><br>"Vidura said,&#8212;'The illustrious king, with his sons, is well and happy,<br>and surrounded by his relatives he reigneth even like Indra himself. The<br>king is happy with his sons who are all obedient to him and hath no<br>grief. The illustrious monarch is bent on his own aggrandisement. The<br>king of the Kurus hath commanded me to enquire after thy peace and<br>prosperity, and to ask thee to repair to Hastinapore with thy brothers<br>and to say, after beholding king Dhritarashtra's newly erected palace,<br>whether that one is equal to thy own. Repairing thither, O son of Pritha,<br>with thy brothers, enjoy ye in that mansion and sit to a friendly match<br>at dice. We shall be glad if thou goest, as the Kurus have already<br>arrived there. And thou wilt see there those gamblers and cheats that the<br>illustrious king Dhritarashtra hath already brought thither. It is for<br>this, O king, that I have come hither. Let the king's command be approved<br>by thee.<br><br>"Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'O Kshatta, if we sit to a match at dice, we may<br>quarrel. What man is there, who knowing all this, will consent to gamble?<br>What dost thou think fit for us? We all are obedient to thy counsels.'<br><br>"Vidura said,&#8212;'I know that gambling is the root of misery, and I strove<br>to dissuade the king from it. The king, however, hath sent me to thee.<br>Having known all this, O learned one, do what is beneficial.<br><br>"Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'Besides the sons of Dhritarashtra what other<br>dishonest gamblers are there ready for play? Tell us, O Vidura, who they<br>are and with whom we shall have to play, staking hundreds upon hundreds<br>of our possessions.'<br><br>"Vidura said,&#8212;'O monarch, Sakuni, the king of Gandhara, an adept at<br>dice, having great skill of hand and desperate in stakes, Vivingati, king<br>Chitrasena, Satyavrata, Purumitra and Jaya, these, O king, are there.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'It would seem then that some of the most desperate<br>and terrible gamblers always depending upon deceit are there. This whole<br>universe, however, is at the will of its Maker, under the control of<br>fate. It is not free. O learned one, I do not desire, at the command of<br>king Dhritarashtra to engage myself in gambling. The father always<br>wisheth to benefit his son. Thou art our master, O Vidura. Tell me what<br>is proper for us. Unwilling as I am to gamble, I will not do so, if the<br>wicked Sakuni doth not summon me to it in the Sabha? If, however, he<br>challengeth me, I will never refuse. For that, as settled, is my eternal<br>vow."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"King Yudhishthira the just having said this<br>unto Vidura, commanded that preparations for his journey might be made<br>without loss of time. And the next day, the king accompanied by his<br>relatives and attendants and taking with him also the women of the<br>household with Draupadi in their midst, set out for the capital of the<br>Kurus. 'Like some brilliant body falling before the eyes, Fate depriveth<br>us of reason, and man, tied as it were with a cord, submitteth to the<br>sway of Providence,' saying this, king Yudhishthira, that chastiser of<br>the foe, set out with Kshatta, without deliberating upon that summons<br>from Dhritarashtra. And that slayer of hostile heroes, the son of Pandu<br>and Pritha, riding upon the car that had been given him by the king of<br>Valhika, and attired also in royal robes, set out with his brothers. And<br>the king, blazing as it were with royal splendour, with Brahmanas walking<br>before him, set out from his city, summoned by Dhritarashtra and impelled<br>by what hath been ordained by Kala (Time). And arriving at Hastinapore he<br>went to the palace of Dhritarashtra. And going there, the son of Pandu<br>approached the king. And the exalted one then approached Bhishma and<br>Drona and Karna, and Kripa, and the son of Drona, and embraced and was<br>embraced by them all. And the mighty-armed one, endued with great<br>prowess, then approached Somadatta, and then Duryodhana and Salya, and<br>the son of Suvala, and those other kings also that had arrived there<br>before him. The king then went to the brave Dusshasana and then to all<br>his (other) brothers and then to Jayadratha and next to all the Kurus one<br>after another. And the mighty-armed one, then surrounded by all his<br>brothers, entered the apartment of the wise king Dhritarashtra. And then<br>Yudhishthira beheld the reverend Gandhari, ever obedient to her lord, and<br>surrounded by her daughters-in-law like Rohini by the stars. And saluting<br>Gandhari and blessed by her in return, the king then beheld his old<br>uncle, that illustrious monarch whose wisdom was his eye. King<br>Dhritarashtra then, O monarch, smelt his head as also the heads of those<br>four other princes of the Kuru race, viz., the sons of Pandu with<br>Bhimasena as their eldest. And, O king, beholding&#8212;the handsome Pandava<br>those tigers among men, all the Kurus became exceedingly glad. And<br>commanded by the king, the Pandavas then retired to the chambers allotted<br>to them and which were all furnished with jewels and gems. And when they<br>had retired into the chambers, the women of Dhritarashtra's household<br>with Dussala taking the lead visited them. And the daughters-in-law of<br>Dhritarashtra beholding the blazing and splendid beauty and prosperity of<br>Yajnaseni, became cheerless and filled with jealousy. And those tigers<br>among men, having conversed with the ladies went through their daily<br>physical exercises and then performed the religious rites of the day. And<br>having finished their daily devotions, they decked their persons with<br>sandal paste of the most fragrant kind. And desiring to secure good luck<br>and prosperity they caused (by gifts) the Brahmanas to utter<br>benedictions. And then eating food that was of the best taste they<br>retired to their chambers for the night. And those bulls among the Kurus<br>then were put to sleep with music by handsome females. And obtaining from<br>them what came in due succession, those subjugators of hostile towns<br>passed with cheerful hearts that delightful night in pleasure and sport.<br>And waked by the bards with sweet music, they rose from their beds, and<br>having passed the night thus in happiness, they rose at dawn and having<br>gone through the usual rites, they entered into the assembly house and<br>were saluted by those that were ready there for gambling."
