                            Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"That bull among men, Duryodhana, continued to dwell<br>in that, assembly house (of the Pandavas). And with Sakuni, the Kuru<br>prince slowly examined the whole of that mansion, and the Kuru prince<br>beheld in it many celestial designs, which he had never seen before in<br>the city called after the elephant (Hastinapore). And one day king<br>Duryodhana in going round that mansion came upon a crystal surface. And<br>the king, from ignorance, mistaking it for a pool of water, drew up his<br>clothes. And afterwards finding out his mistake the king wandered about<br>the mansion in great sorrow. And sometime after, the king, mistaking a<br>lake of crystal water adorned with lotuses of crystal petals for land,<br>fell into it with all his clothes on. Beholding Duryodhana fallen into<br>the lake, the mighty Bhima laughed aloud as also the menials of the<br>palace. And the servants, at the command of the king, soon brought him<br>dry and handsome clothes. Beholding the plight of Duryodhana, the mighty<br>Bhima and Arjuna and both the twins&#8212;all laughed aloud. Being unused to<br>putting up with insults, Duryodhana could not bear that laugh of theirs.<br>Concealing his emotions he even did not cast his looks on them. And<br>beholding the monarch once more draw up his clothes to cross a piece of<br>dry land which he had mistaken for water, they all laughed again. And the<br>king sometime after mistook a closed door made of crystal as open. And as<br>he was about to pass through it his head struck against it, and he stood<br>with his brain reeling. And mistaking as closed another door made of<br>crystal that was really open, the king in attempting to open it with<br>stretched hands, tumbled down. And coming upon another door that was<br>really open, the king thinking it as closed, went away from it. And, O<br>monarch, king Duryodhana beholding that vast wealth in the Rajasuya<br>sacrifice and having become the victim of those numerous errors within<br>the assembly house at last returned, with the leave of the Pandavas, to<br>Hastinapore.<br><br>And the heart of king Duryodhana, afflicted at sight of the prosperity of<br>the Pandavas, became inclined to sin, as he proceeded towards his city<br>reflecting on all he had seen and suffered. And beholding the Pandavas<br>happy and all the kings of the earth paying homage to them, as also<br>everybody, young and old, engaged in doing good unto them, and reflecting<br>also on the splendour and prosperity of the illustrious sons of Pandu,<br>Duryodhana, the son of Dhritarashtra, became pale. In proceeding (to his<br>city) with an efflicted heart, the prince thought of nothing else but<br>that assembly house and that unrivalled prosperity of the wise<br>Yudhishthira. And Duryodhana, the son of Dhritarashtra, was so taken up<br>with his thoughts then that he spoke not a word to Suvala's son even<br>though the latter addressed him repeatedly. And Sakuni, beholding him<br>absent-minded, said,&#8212;'O Duryodhana, why art thou proceeding thus'?<br><br>"Duryodhana replied,&#8212;O uncle, beholding this whole earth owning the sway<br>of Yudhishthira in consequence of the might of the illustrious Arjuna's<br>weapons and beholding also that sacrifice of the son of Pritha like unto<br>the sacrifice of Sakra himself of great glory among the celestials, I,<br>being filled with jealousy and burning day and night, am being dried up<br>like a shallow tank in the summer season. Behold, when Sisupala was slain<br>by the chief of the Satwatas, there was no man to take the side of<br>Sisupala. Consumed by the fire of the Pandava, they all forgave that<br>offence; otherwise who is there that could forgive it? That highly<br>improper act of grave consequence done by Vasudeva succeeded in<br>consequence of the power of the illustrious son of Pandu. And so many<br>monarchs also brought with them various kinds of wealth for king<br>Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, like tribute-paying Vaisyas! Beholding<br>Yudhishthira's prosperity of such splendour, my heart burneth, efflicted<br>with jealously, although it behoveth me not to be jealous.'<br><br>"Having reflected in this way, Duryodhana, as if burnt by fire, addressed<br>the king of Gandhara again and said,&#8212;'I shall throw myself upon a<br>flaming fire or swallow poison or drown myself in water. I cannot live.<br>What man is there in the world possessed of vigour who can bear to see<br>his foes in the enjoyment of prosperity and himself in destitution?<br>Therefore I who bear to see that accession of prosperity and fortune (in<br>my foes) am neither a woman nor one that is not a woman, neither also a<br>man nor one that is not a man. Beholding their sovereignty over the world<br>and vast affluence, as also that sacrifice, who is there like me that<br>would not smart under all that? Alone I am incapable of acquiring such<br>royal prosperity; nor do I behold allies that could help me in the<br>matter. It is for this that I am thinking of self-destruction. Beholding<br>that great and serene prosperity of the son of Kunti, I regard Fate as<br>supreme and exertions fruitless. O son of Suvala, formerly I strove to<br>compass his destruction. But baffling all my efforts he hath grown in<br>prosperity even like the lotus from within a pool of water. It is for<br>this that I regard Fate as supreme and exertions fruitless. Behold, the<br>sons of Dhritarashtra are decaying and the sons of Pritha are growing day<br>by day. Beholding that prosperity of the Pandavas, and that assembly<br>house of theirs, and those menials laughing at me, my heart burneth as if<br>it were on fire. Therefore, O uncle, know me now as deeply grieved and<br>filled with jealousy, and speak of it to Dhritarashtra.
