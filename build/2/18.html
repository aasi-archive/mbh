                            "Krishna continued,&#8212;'hearing these words of the king, the Rakshasa woman<br>answered&#8212;Blessed be thou, O king of kings. Capable of assuming any form<br>at will. I am a Rakshasa woman called Jara. I am living, O king, happily<br>in thy house, worshipped by all. Every day I wander from house to house<br>of men. Indeed, I was created of old by the Self-create and was named<br>Grihadevi (the household goddess)'. Of celestial beauty I was placed (in<br>the world) for the destruction of the Danavas. He that with devotion<br>painteth on the walls (of his house) a likeness of myself endued with<br>youth and in the midst of children, must have prosperity in his abode;<br>otherwise a household must sustain decay and destruction. O lord, painted<br>on the walls of thy house is a likeness of myself surrounded by numerous<br>children. Stationed there I am daily worshipped with scents and flowers,<br>with incense and edibles and various objects of enjoyment. Thus<br>worshipped in thy house, I daily think of doing thee some good in return.<br>It chanced, O virtuous king, that I beheld the fragmentary bodies of thy<br>son. When these happened to be united by me, a living child was formed of<br>them. O great king, it hath been so owing to thy good fortune alone. I<br>have been only the instrument, I am capable of swallowing the mountain of<br>Meru itself, what shall I say of the child? I have, however, been<br>gratified with thee in consequence of the worship I receive in thy house.<br>It is, therefore, O king, that I have bestowed this child on thee.<br><br>"Krishna continued,&#8212;Having spoken these words, O king, Jara disappeared<br>there and then. The king having obtained the child then entered the<br>palace. And the king then caused all the rites of infancy to be performed<br>on that child, and ordered a festival to be observed by his people in<br>Honour of that Rakshasa woman. And the monarch equal unto Brahma himself<br>then bestowed a name on his child. And he said that because the child had<br>been united by Jara, he should be called (Jarasandha i.e., united by<br>Jara). And the son of the king of Magadha endued with great energy, began<br>to grow up in bulk and strength like a fire into which hath been poured<br>libation of clarified butter. And increasing day by day like the moon in<br>the bright fortnight, the child began to enhance the joy of his parents.'"
