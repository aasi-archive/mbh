                            Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"I shall now recite to you the deeds and triumphs of<br>Nakula, and how that exalted one conquered the direction that had once<br>been subjugated by Vasudeva. The intelligent Nakula, surrounded by a<br>large host, set out from Khandavaprastha for the west, making this earth<br>tremble with the shouts and the leonine roars of the warriors and the<br>deep rattle of chariot wheels. And the hero first assailed the<br>mountainous country called Rohitaka that was dear unto (the celestial<br>generalissimo) Kartikeya and which was delightful and prosperous and full<br>of kine and every kind of wealth and produce. And the encounter the son<br>of Pandu had with the Mattamyurakas of that country was fierce. And the<br>illustrious Nakula after this, subjugated the whole of the desert country<br>and the region known as Sairishaka full of plenty, as also that other one<br>called Mahetta. And the hero had a fierce encounter with the royal sage<br>Akrosa. And the son of Pandu left that part of the country having<br>subjugated the Dasarnas, the Sivis, the Trigartas, the Amvashtas, the<br>Malavas, the five tribes of the Karnatas, and those twice born classes<br>that were called the Madhyamakeyas and Vattadhanas. And making circuitous<br>journey that bull among men then conquered the (Mlechcha) tribes called<br>the Utsava-sanketas. And the illustrious hero soon brought under<br>subjection the mighty Gramaniya that dwelt on the shore of the sea, and<br>the Sudras and the Abhiras that dwelt on the banks of the Saraswati, and<br>all those tribes that lived upon fisheries, and those also that dwelt on<br>the mountains, and the whole of the country called after the five rivers,<br>and the mountains called Amara, and the country called Uttarayotisha and<br>the city of Divyakutta and the tribe called Dwarapala. And the son of<br>Pandu, by sheer force, reduced to subjection the Ramathas, the Harahunas,<br>and various kings of the west. And while staying there Nakula sent. O<br>Bharata, messengers unto Vasudeva. And Vasudeva with all the Yadavas<br>accepted his sway. And the mighty hero, proceeding thence to Sakala, the<br>city of the Madras, made his uncle Salya accept from affection the sway<br>of the Pandavas. And, O monarch, the illustrious prince deserving the<br>hospitality and entertainment at his uncle's hands, was well entertained<br>by his uncle. And skilled in war, the prince, taking from Salya a large<br>quantity of jewels and gems, left his kingdom. And the son of Pandu then<br>reduced to subjection the fierce Mlechchas residing on the sea coast, as<br>also the wild tribes of the Palhavas, the Kiratas, the Yavanas, and the<br>Sakas. And having subjugated various monarchs, and making all of them pay<br>tributes, Nakula that foremost of the Kurus, full of resources, retraced<br>his way towards his own city. And, O king, so great was the treasure<br>which Nakula brought that ten thousand camels could carry it with<br>difficulty on their backs. And arriving at Indraprastha, the heroic and<br>fortunate son of Madri presented the whole of that wealth unto<br>Yudhishthira.<br><br>"Thus, O king, did Nakula subjugate the countries that lay to the<br>west&#8212;the direction that is presided over by the god Varuna, and that had<br>once before been subjugated by Vasudeva himself!"
