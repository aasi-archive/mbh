                            Duryodhana said,&#8212;'O sinless one, listen to me as I describe that large<br>mass of wealth consisting of various kinds of tribute presented unto<br>Yudhishthira by the kings of the earth. They that dwell by the side of<br>the river Sailoda flowing between the mountains of Mer and Mandara and<br>enjoy the delicious shade of topes of the Kichaka bamboo, viz., the<br>Khashas, Ekasanas, the Arhas, the Pradaras, the Dirghavenus, the Paradas,<br>the Kulindas, the Tanganas, and the other Tanganas, brought as tribute<br>heaps of gold measured in dronas (jars) and raised from underneath the<br>earth by ants and therefore called after these creatures. The mountain<br>tribes endued with great strength having brought as tribute numerous<br>Chamaras (long brushes) soft and black and others white as moon-beam and<br>sweet honey extracted from the flowers growing on the Himavat as also<br>from the Mishali champaka and garlands of flowers brought from the region<br>of the northern Kurus, and diverse kinds of plants from the north even<br>from Kailasa, waited with their heads bent down at the gate of king<br>Yudhishthira, being refused permission to enter. I also beheld there<br>numberless chiefs of the Kiratas armed with cruel weapons and ever<br>engaged in cruel deeds, eating of fruits and roots and attired in skins<br>and living on the northern slopes of the Himavat and on the mountain from<br>behind which the sun rises and in the region of Karusha on the sea-coast<br>and on both sides of the Lohitya mountains. And, O king, having brought<br>with them as tribute loads upon loads of sandal and aloe as also black<br>aloe, and heaps upon heaps of valuable skins and gold and perfumes, and<br>ten thousand serving-girls of their own race, and many beautiful animals<br>and birds of remote countries, and much gold of great splendour procured<br>from mountains, the Kiratas waited at the gate, being refused permission<br>to enter. The Kairatas, the Daradas, the Darvas, the Suras, the<br>Vaiamakas, the Audumvaras, the Durvibhagas, the Kumaras, the Paradas<br>along with the Vahlikas, the Kashmiras, the Ghorakas, the Hansakayanas,<br>the Sivis, the Trigartas, the Yauddheyas, the ruler of Madras and the<br>Kaikeyas, the Amvashtas, the Kaukuras, the Tarkshyas, the Vastrapas along<br>with the Palhavas, the Vashatayas, the Mauleyas along with the<br>Kshudrakas, and the Malavas, the Paundrayas, the Kukkuras, the Sakas, the<br>Angas, the Vangas, the Punras, the Sanavatyas, and the Gayas&#8212;these good<br>and well-born Kshatriyas distributed into regular clans and trained to<br>the use of arms, brought tribute unto king Yudhishthira by hundreds and<br>thousands. And the Vangas, the Kalingas, the Magadhas, the Tamraliptas,<br>the Supundrakas, the Dauvalikas, the Sagarakas, the Patrornas, the<br>Saisavas, and innumerable Karnapravaranas, who presented themselves at<br>the gate, were told by the gate-keepers at the command of the king, that<br>if they could wait and bring good tribute they could obtain admission.<br>Then the kings of those nations each gave a thousand elephants furnished<br>with tusks like unto the shafts of ploughs and decked with girdles made<br>of gold, and covered with fine blankets and therefore, resembling the<br>lotus in hue. And they were all darkish as rocks and always musty, and<br>procured from the sides of the Kamyaka lake, and covered with defensive<br>armour. And they were also exceedingly patient and of the best breed. And<br>having made these presents, those kings were permitted to enter. O king,<br>these and many others, coming from various regions, and numberless other<br>illustrious kings, brought jewels and gems unto this sacrifice. And<br>Chitraratha, also the king of Gandharvas, the friend of Indra, gave four<br>hundred horses gifted with the speed of the wind. And the Gandharva<br>Tumvuru gladly gave a hundred horses of the colour of mango leaf and<br>decked in gold. And, O thou of the Kuru race, the celebrated king of the<br>Mlechcha tribe, called the Sukaras, gave many hundreds of excellent<br>elephants. And Virata, the king of Matsya, gave as tribute two thousand<br>elephants decked in gold. And king Vasudana from the kingdom of Pansu<br>presented unto the son of Pandu six and twenty elephants and two thousand<br>horses. O king, all decked in gold and endued with speed and strength and<br>in full vigour of youth, and diverse other kinds of wealth. And Yajnasena<br>presented unto the sons of Pandu for the sacrifice, fourteen thousand<br>serving-girls and ten thousand serving-men with their wives, many<br>hundreds of excellent elephants, six and twenty cars with elephants yoked<br>unto them, and also his whole kingdom. And Vasudeva of the Vrishni race,<br>in order to enhance the dignity of Arjuna, gave fourteen thousands of<br>excellent elephants. Indeed, Krishna is the soul of Arjuna and Arjuna is<br>the soul of Krishna, and whatever Arjuna may say Krishna is certain to<br>accomplish. And Krishna is capable of abandoning heaven itself for the<br>sake of Arjuna. and Arjuna also is capable of sacrificing his life for<br>the sake of Krishna. And the Kings of Chola and Pandya, though they<br>brought numberless jars of gold filled with fragrant sandal juice from<br>the hills of Malaya, and loads of sandal and aloe wood from the Dardduras<br>hills, and many gems of great brilliancy and fine cloths inlaid with<br>gold, did not obtain permission (to enter). And the king of the Singhalas<br>gave those best of sea-born gems called the lapis lazuli, and heaps of<br>pearls also, and hundreds of coverlets for elephants. And numberless<br>dark-coloured men with the ends of their, eyes red as copper, attired in<br>clothes decked with gems, waited at the gate with those presents. And<br>numberless Brahmanas and Kshatriyas who had been vanquished, and Vaisyas<br>and serving Sudras, from love of Yudhishthira, brought tribute unto the<br>son of Pandu. And even all the Mlechchas, from love and respect, came<br>unto Yudhishthira. And all orders of men, good, indifferent and low,<br>belonging to numberless races, coming from diverse lands made<br>Yudhishthira's habitation the epitome of the world.<br><br>"And beholding the kings of the earth to present unto the foes such<br>excellent and valuable presents, I wished for death out of grief. And O<br>king, I will now tell thee of the servants of the Pandavas, people for<br>whom Yudhishthira supplieth food, both cooked and uncooked. There are a<br>hundred thousand billions of mounted elephants and cavalry and a hundred<br>millions of cars and countless foot soldiers. At one place raw provisions<br>are being measured out; at another they are being cooked; and at another<br>place the foods are being distributed. And the notes of festivity are<br>being heard everywhere. And amongst men of all orders I beheld not a<br>single one in the mansion of Yudhishthira that had not food and drink and<br>ornaments. And eighty-eight thousands of Snataka Brahmanas leading<br>domestic lives, all supported by Yudhishthira, with thirty serving-girls<br>given unto each, gratified by the king, always pray with complacent<br>hearts for the destruction of his foes. And ten thousands of other<br>ascetics with vital seed drawn up, daily eat of golden plates in<br>Yudhishthira's palace. And, O king, Yajnaseni, without having eaten<br>herself, daily seeth whether everybody, including even the deformed and<br>the dwarfs, hath eaten or not. And, O Bharata, only two do not pay<br>tribute unto the son of Kunti, viz., the Panchalas in consequence of<br>their relationship by marriage, and the Andhakas and Vrishnis in<br>consequence of their friendship.
