                            Duryodhana said,&#8212;'O Kshatta, thou art always boasting of the fame of our<br>enemies, deprecating the sons of Dhritarashtra. We know, O Vidura, of<br>whom thou art really fond. Thou always disregardest us as children, That<br>man standeth confest, who wisheth for success unto those that are near to<br>him and defeat unto those that are not his favourites. His praise and<br>blame are applied accordingly. Thy tongue and mind betray thy heart. But<br>the hostility thou showeth in speech is even greater than what is in thy<br>heart. Thou hast been cherished by us like a serpent on our lap. Like a<br>cat thou wishest evil unto him that cherisheth thee. The wise have said<br>that there is no sin graver than that of injuring one's master. How is<br>it, O Kshatta, that thou dost not fear this sin? Having vanquished our<br>enemies we have obtained great advantages. Use not harsh words in respect<br>of us. Thou art always willing to make peace with the foes. And it is for<br>this reason that thou hatest us always. A man becometh a foe by speaking<br>words that are unpardonable. Then again in praising the enemy, the<br>secrets of one's own party should not be divulged. (Thou however,<br>transgressest this rule). Therefore, O thou parasite, why dost thou<br>obstruct us so? Thou sayest whatever thou wishest. Insult us not. We know<br>thy mind. Go and learn sitting at the feet of the old. Keen up the<br>reputation that thou hast won. Meddle not with the affairs of other men.<br>Do not imagine that thou art our chief. Tell us not harsh words always, O<br>Vidura. We do not ask thee what is for our good. Cease, irritate not<br>those that have already borne too much at thy hands. There is only one<br>Controller, no second. He controlleth even the child that is in the<br>mother's womb. I am controlled by Him. Like water that always floweth in<br>a downward course, I am acting precisely in the way in which He is<br>directing me. He that breaketh his head against a stone-wall, and he that<br>feedeth a serpent, are guided in those acts of theirs by their own<br>intellect. (Therefore, in this matter I am guided by my own<br>intelligence). He becometh a foe who seeketh to control others by force.<br>When advice, however, is offered in a friendly spirit, the learned bear<br>with it. He again that hath set fire to such a highly inflammable object<br>as camphor, beholdeth not its ashes. If he runneth immediately to<br>extinguish it. One should not give shelter to another who is the friend<br>of his foes, or to another who is ever jealous of his protector or to<br>another who is evil-minded. Therefore, O Vidura, go whither-so-ever thou<br>pleasest. A wife that is unchaste, however well-treated, forsaketh her<br>husband yet.'<br><br>"Vidura addressing Dhritarashtra, said, 'O monarch, tell us (impartially)<br>like a witness what thou thinkest of the conduct of those who abandon<br>their serving-men thus for giving instruction to them. The hearts of<br>kings are, indeed, very fickle. Granting protection at first, they strike<br>with clubs at last. O prince (Duryodhana), thou regardest thyself as<br>mature in intellect, and, O thou of bad heart, thou regardest me as a<br>child. But consider that he is a child who having first accepted one for<br>a friend, subsequently findeth fault with him. An evil-hearted man can<br>never be brought to the path of rectitude, like an unchaste wife in the<br>house of a well-born person. Assuredly, instruction is not agreeable to<br>this bull of the Bharata race like a husband of sixty years to a damsel<br>that is young. After this, O king, if thou wishest to hear words that are<br>agreeable to thee, in respect of all acts good or bad, ask thou women and<br>idiots and cripples or persons of that description. A sinful man speaking<br>words that are agreeable may be had in this world. But a speaker of words<br>that are disagreeable though sound as regimen, or a hearer of the same,<br>is very rare. He indeed, is a king's true ally who disregarding what is<br>agreeable or disagreeable to his master beareth himself virtuously and<br>uttereth what may be disagreeable but necessary as regimen. O great king,<br>drink thou that which the honest drink and the dishonest shun, even<br>humility, which is like a medicine that is bitter, pungent, burning,<br>unintoxicating, disagreeable, and revolting. And drinking it, O king,<br>regain thou thy sobriety. I always wish Dhritarashtra and his sons<br>affluence and fame. Happen what may unto thee, here I bow to thee (and<br>take my leave). Let the Brahmanas wish me well. O son of Kuru, this is<br>the lesson I carefully inculcate, that the wise should never enrage such<br>as adders as have venom in their very glances!"
