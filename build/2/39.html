                            (Sisupala-badha Parva)<br><br>"Vaisampayana said,&#8212;Beholding that vast assembly of kings agitated with<br>wrath, even like the terrific sea agitated by the winds that blow at the<br>time of the universal dissolution, Yudhishthira addressing the aged<br>Bhishma, that chief of intelligent men and the grandsire of the Kurus,<br>even like Puruhita (Indra) that slayer of foes, of abundant energy<br>addressing Vrihaspati, said,&#8212;'This vast ocean of kings, hath been<br>agitated by wrath. Tell me, O Grandsire, what I should do in view of<br>this. O Grandsire, now what I should do that my sacrifice may not be<br>obstructed and my subjects may not be injured.'<br><br>"When king Yudhishthira the just, conversant with morality, said this,<br>Bhishma the grandsire of the Kurus, spoke these words in reply,&#8212;'Fear<br>not, O tiger of the Kurus. Can the dog slay the lion? I have before this<br>found out a way that is both beneficial and comfortable to practise. As<br>dogs in a pack approaching the lion that is asleep bark together, so are<br>all these lords of earth. Indeed, O child, like dogs before the lion,<br>these (monarchs) are barking in rage before the sleeping lion of the<br>Vrishni race. Achyuta now is like a lion that is asleep. Until he waketh<br>up, this chief of the Chedis&#8212;this lion among men&#8212;maketh these monarchs<br>look like lions. O child, O thou foremost of all monarchs, this Sisupala<br>possessed of little intelligence is desirous of taking along with him all<br>these kings, through the agency of him who is the soul of the universe,<br>to the regions of Yama. Assuredly, O Bharata Vishnu hath been desirous of<br>taking back unto himself the energy that existeth in this Sisupala. O<br>Chief of all intelligent men, O son of Kunti, the intelligence of this<br>wicked-minded king of the Chedis, as also of all these monarchs, hath<br>become perverse. Indeed, the intelligence of all those whom this tiger<br>among men desireth to take unto himself, becometh perverse even like that<br>of this king of the Chedis. O Yudhishthira, Madhava is the progenitor as<br>also the destroyer of all created beings of the four species, (oviparous,<br>etc.,) existing in the three worlds.'"<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued&#8212;Then the ruler of Chedis, having heard these<br>words of Bhishma, addressed the latter, O Bharata, in words that were<br>stern and rough."
