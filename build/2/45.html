                            (Dyuta Parva)<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"when that foremost of sacrifices, the Rajasuya so<br>difficult of accomplishment, was completed, Vyasa surrounded by his<br>disciples presented himself before Yudhishthira. And Yudhishthira, upon<br>beholding him quickly rose from his seat, surrounded by his brothers, and<br>worshipped the Rishi who was his grand-father, with water to wash his<br>feet and the offer of a seat. The illustrious one having taken his seat<br>on a costly carpet inlaid with gold, addressed king Yudhishthira the just<br>and said.&#8212;'Take thy seat'. And after the king had taken his seat<br>surrounded by his brothers, the illustrious Vyasa, truthful in speech<br>said,&#8212;'O son of Kunti, thou growest from good fortune. Thou hast<br>obtained imperial sway so difficult of acquisition. And O perpetuator of<br>the Kuru race, all the Kauravas have prospered in consequence of thee. O<br>Emperor, I have been duly worshipped. I desire now to go with thy leave!<br>King Yudhishthira the just, thus addressed by the Rishi of dark hue,<br>saluted (him) his grandfather and touching his feet said,&#8212;'O chief of<br>men, a doubt difficult of being dispelled, hath risen within me. O bull<br>among regenerate ones, save thee there is none to remove it. The<br>illustrious Rishi Narada said that (as a consequence of the Rajasuya<br>sacrifice) three kinds of portents, viz., celestial, atmospherical and<br>terrestrial ones happen. O grandsire, have those portents been ended by<br>the fall of the kind of the Chedis?''<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Hearing these words of the king, the exalted<br>son of Parasara, the island-born Vyasa of dark hue, spoke these<br>words,&#8212;'For thirteen years, O king, those portents will bear mighty<br>consequences ending in destruction, O king of kings, of all the<br>Kshatriyas. In course of time, O bull of the Bharata race, making thee<br>the sole cause, the assembled Kshatriyas of the world will be destroyed,<br>O Bharata, for the sins of Duryodhana and through the might of Bhima and<br>Arjuna. In thy dream, O king of kings thou wilt behold towards the end of<br>this might the blue throated Bhava, the slayer of Tripura, ever absorbed<br>in meditation, having the bull for his mark, drinking off the human<br>skull, and fierce and terrible, that lord of all creatures, that god of<br>gods, the husband of Uma, otherwise called Hara and Sarva, and Vrisha,<br>armed with the trident and the bow called Pinaka, and attired in tiger<br>skin. And thou wilt behold Siva, tall and white as the Kailasa cliff and<br>seated on his bull, gazing unceasingly towards the direction (south)<br>presided over by the king of the Pitris. Even this will be the dream thou<br>wilt dream today, O king of kings. Do not grieve for dreaming such a<br>dream. None can rise superior to the influence of Time. Blest be thou! I<br>will now proceed towards the Kailasa mountain. Rule thou the earth with<br>vigilance and steadiness, patiently bearing every privation!'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Having said this, the illustrious and<br>island-born Vyasa of dark hue, accompanied by his disciples ever<br>following the dictates of the Vedas, proceeded towards Kailasa. And after<br>the grand-father had thus gone away, the king afflicted with anxiety and<br>grief, began to think continuously upon what the Rishi hath said. And he<br>said to himself, 'Indeed what the Rishi hath said must come to pass. We<br>will succeed in warding off the fates by exertion alone?' Then<br>Yudhishthira endued with great energy addressing all his brothers, said,<br>'Ye tigers among men, ye have heard what the island-born Rishi hath told<br>me. Having heard the words of the Rishi, I have arrived at this firm<br>resolution viz., that I should die, as I am ordained to be the cause of<br>the destruction of all Kshatriyas. Ye my dear ones, if Time hath intended<br>so what need is there for me to live?' Hearing these words of the king,<br>Arjuna replied, 'O king, yield not thyself to this terrible depression<br>that is destructive of reason. Mustering fortitude, O great king, do what<br>would be beneficial.' Yudhishthira then, firm in truth, thinking all the<br>while of Dwaipayana's words answered his brothers thus,&#8212;'Blest be ye.<br>Listen to my vow from this day. For thirteen years, what ever purpose<br>have I to live for, I shall not speak a hard word to my brothers or to<br>any of the kings of the earth. Living under the command of my relatives,<br>I shall practise virtue, exemplifying my vow. If I live in this way,<br>making no distinction between my own children and others, there will be<br>no disagreement (between me and others). It is disagreement that is the<br>cause of war in the world. Keeping war at a distance, and ever doing what<br>is agreeable to others, evil reputation will not be mine in the world, ye<br>bulls among men. Hearing these words of their eldest brother, the<br>Pandavas, always engaged in doing what was agreeable to him, approved of<br>them. And Yudhishthira the just, having pledged so, along with his<br>brothers in the midst of that assembly, gratified his priests as also the<br>gods with due ceremonies. And, O bull of the Bharata race, after all the<br>monarchs had gone away, Yudhishthira along with his brothers, having<br>performed the usual auspicious rites, accompanied by his ministers<br>entered his own palace. And, O ruler of men, king Duryodhana and Sakuni,<br>the son of Suvala, continued to dwell in that delightful assembly house.
