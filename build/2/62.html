                            "Vidura said,&#8212;"Gambling is the root of dissensions. It bringeth about<br>disunion. Its consequences are frightful. Yet having recourse to this,<br>Dhritarashtra's son Duryodhana createth for himself fierce enmity. The<br>descendants of Pratipa and Santanu, with their fierce troops and their<br>allies the Vahlikas, will, for the sins of Duryodhana meet with<br>destruction. Duryodhana, in consequence of this intoxication, forcibly<br>driveth away luck and prosperity from his kingdom, even like an infuriate<br>bull breaking his own horns himself. That brave and learned person who<br>disregarding his own foresight, followeth, O king, (the bent of) another<br>man's heart, sinketh in terrible affliction even like one that goeth into<br>the sea in a boat guided by a child. Duryodhana is gambling with the son<br>of Pandu, and thou art in raptures that he is winning. And it is such<br>success that begeteth war, which endeth in the destruction of men. This<br>fascination (of gambling) that thou has well-devised only leadeth to dire<br>results. Thus hast thou simply brought on by these counsels great<br>affliction to thy heart. And this thy quarrel with Yudhishthira, who is<br>so closely related to thee, even if thou hadst not foreseen it, is still<br>approved by thee. Listen, ye sons of Santanu, ye descendants of Pratipa,<br>who are now in this assembly of the Kauravas, to these words of wisdom.<br>Enter ye not into the terrible fire that hath blazed forth following the<br>wretch. When Ajatasatru, the son of Pandu, intoxicated with dice, giveth<br>way to his wrath, and Vrikodara and Arjuna and the twins (do the same),<br>who, in that hour of confusion, will prove your refuge? O great king,<br>thou art thyself a mine of wealth. Thou canst earn (by other means) as<br>much wealth as thou seekest to earn by gambling. What dost thou gain by<br>winning from the Pandavas their vast wealth? Win the Pandavas themselves,<br>who will be to thee more than all the wealth they have. We all know the<br>skill of Suvala in play. This hill-king knoweth many nefarious methods in<br>gambling. Let Sakuni return whence he came. War not, O Bharata, with the<br>sons of Pandu!'
