                            "Krishna said,&#8212;some time after this, the great ascetic, the exalted<br>Chandakausika, again came into the country of the Magadhas. Filled with<br>joy at the advent of the Rishi, king Vrihadratha, accompanied by his<br>ministers and priest and wives and son, went out to receive him. And, O<br>Bharata, worshipping the Rishi with water to wash his feet and face, and<br>with the offerings of Arghya the king then offered his whole kingdom<br>along with his son for the acceptance of the Rishi. The adorable Rishi<br>accepting that worship offered by the king, addressing the ruler of<br>Magadha, O monarch, said with well-pleased heart,&#8212;O king, I knew all<br>this by spiritual insight. But hear, O king of kings, what this son of<br>thine will be in future, as also what his beauty, excellence, strength,<br>and valour will be. Without doubt this son of thine, growing in<br>prosperity and endued with prowess, will obtain all these. Like other<br>birds that can never imitate the speed of Vinata's son (Garuda), the<br>other monarchs of the earth will not be able to equal in energy this thy<br>son, who will be endued with great valour. And all those that will stand<br>in his way will certainly be destroyed. Like the force of the current<br>that can never make the slightest impression upon the rocky breast of a<br>mountain, weapons hurled at him even by the celestials will fail to<br>produce the least pain in him. He will blaze forth above the heads of all<br>that wear crowns on their brows. Like the sun that dims the lustre of all<br>luminous bodies, this son of thine will rob all monarchs of their<br>splendour. Even kings that are powerful and own large armies and<br>numberless vehicles and animals, upon approaching this son of thine, will<br>all perish as insects upon fire. This child will seize the growing<br>prosperity of all kings like the ocean receiving the rivers swollen with<br>the water of the rainy season. Like the huge earth that bears all kinds<br>of produce, supporting things that are both good and evil, this child<br>endued with great strength will support all the four orders of men. And<br>all the kings of the earth will live in obedience to the commands of this<br>child just as every creature endued with body live in dependence upon<br>Vayu that is dear as self unto beings. This prince of Magadha&#8212;the<br>mightiest of all men in the world&#8212;will behold with his physical eyes the<br>god of gods called Rudra or Hara, the slayer of Tripura. O thou slayer of<br>all foes, saying this, the Rishi, thinking of his own business, dismissed<br>king Vrihadratha. The lord of the Magadhas then, re-entering his capital,<br>and calling together his friends and relations, installed Jarasandha, on<br>the throne. King Vrihadratha then came to feel a great distaste for<br>worldly pleasures. And after the installation of Jarasandha king<br>Vrihadratha followed by his two wives became an inmate of an ascetic<br>asylum in the woods. And, O king, after his father and mothers had<br>retired into the woods, Jarasandha by his valour brought numerous kings<br>under his sway.'"<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;'King Vrihadratha, having lived for some time<br>in the woods and practised ascetic penances, ascended to heaven at last<br>with his wives. King Jarasandha, also, as uttered by Kausika, having<br>received those numerous boons ruled his kingdom like a father. Some time<br>after when king Kansa was slain by Vasudeva, an enmity arose between him<br>and Krishna. Then, O Bharata, the mighty king of Magadha from his city of<br>Girivraja, whirling a mace ninety-nine times, hurled it towards Mathura.<br>At that time Krishna of wonderful deeds was residing at Mathura. The<br>handsome mace hurled by Jarasandha fell near Mathura at a distance of<br>ninety-nine yojanas from Gririvraja The citizens beholding the<br>circumstance well, went unto Krishna and informed him of the fall of the<br>mace. The place where the mace fell is adjacent to Mathura and is called<br>Gadavasan. Jarasandha had two supporters called Hansa and Dimvaka, both<br>of whom were incapable of being slain by weapons. Well-conversant with<br>the science of politics and morality, in counsel they were the foremost<br>of all intelligent men. I have already told thee everything about that<br>mighty pair. They two and Jarasandha, I believe, are more than a match<br>for three worlds. O brave king, it was for this reason that the powerful<br>Kukkura, Andhaka and Vrishni tribes, acting from motives of policy, did<br>not deem it proper to fight with him.'"
