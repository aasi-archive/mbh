                            Vaisampayana said,&#8212;'O monarch, it was then that the virtuous Gandhari,<br>afflicted with grief on account of her affection for her sons, addressed<br>king Dhritarashtra and said, "When Duryodhana was born, Vidura of great<br>intelligence had said, 'It is well to send this disgrace of the race to<br>the other world. He cried repeatedly and dissonantly like a jackal. It is<br>certain he will prove the destruction of our race. Take this to heart, O<br>king of the Kurus. O Bharata, sink not, for thy own fault, into an ocean<br>of calamity. O lord, accord not thy approbation to the counsels of the<br>wicked ones of immature years. Be not thou the cause of the terrible<br>destruction of this race. Who is there that will break an embankment<br>which hath been completed, or re-kindle a conflagration which hath been<br>extinguished? O bull of the Bharata race, who is there that will provoke<br>the peaceful sons of Pritha? Thou rememberest, O Ajamida, everything, but<br>still I will call thy attention to this. The scriptures can never control<br>the wicked-minded for good or evil. And, O king, a person of immature<br>understanding will never act as one of mature years. Let thy sons follow<br>thee as their leader. Let them not be separated from thee for ever (by<br>losing their lives). Therefore, at my word, O king, abandon this wretch<br>of our race. Thou couldst not, O king, from parental affection, do it<br>before. Know that the time hath come for the destruction of race through<br>him. Err not, O king. Let thy mind, guided by counsels of peace, virtue,<br>and true policy, be what it naturally is. That prosperity which is<br>acquired by the aid of wicked acts, is soon destroyed; while that which<br>is won by mild means taketh root and descendeth from generation to<br>generation."<br><br>"The king, thus addressed by Gandhari who pointed out to him in such<br>language the path of virtue, replied unto her, saying,&#8212;'If the<br>destruction of our race is come, let it take place freely. I am ill able<br>to prevent it. Let it be as they (these my sons) desire. Let the Pandavas<br>return. And let my sons again gamble with the sons of Pandu."
