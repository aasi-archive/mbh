                            'Sisupala said,&#8212;'Old and infamous wretch of thy race, art thou not<br>ashamed of affrighting all these monarchs with these numerous false<br>terrors! Thou art the foremost of the Kurus, and living as thou dost in<br>the third state (celibacy) it is but fit for thee that thou shouldst give<br>such counsel that is so wide of morality. Like a boat tied to another<br>boat or the blind following the blind, are the Kurus who have thee for<br>their guide. Thou hast once more simply pained our hearts by reciting<br>particularly the deeds of this one (Krishna), such as the slaying of<br>Putana and others. Arrogant and ignorant as thou art, and desirous of<br>praising Kesava, why doth not this tongue of thine split up into a<br>hundred parts? How dost thou, superior as thou art in knowledge, desire<br>to praise that cow-boy in respect of whom even men of little intelligence<br>may address invectives? If Krishna in his infancy slew a vulture, what is<br>there remarkable in that, or in that other feat of his, O Bhishma, viz.,<br>in his slaughter of Aswa and Vrishava, both of whom were unskilled in<br>battle? If this one threw drown by a kick an inanimate piece of wood,<br>viz., a car, what is there, O Bhishma, wonderful in that? O Bhishma, what<br>is there remarkable in this one's having supported for a week the<br>Govardhan mount which is like an anthill? 'While sporting on the top of a<br>mountain this one ate a large quantity of food,'&#8212;hearing these words of<br>thine many have wondered exceedingly. But, O thou who art conversant with<br>the rules of morality, is not this still more wrongful that that great<br>person, viz., Kansa, whose food this one ate, hath been slain by him?<br>Thou infamous one of the Kuru race, thou art ignorant of the rules of<br>morality. Hast thou not ever heard, from wise men speaking unto thee,<br>what I would now tell thee? The virtuous and the wise always instruct the<br>honest that weapons must never be made to descend upon women and kine and<br>Brahmanas and upon those whose food hath been taken, as also upon those<br>whose shelter hath been enjoyed. It seemeth, O Bhishma, that all these<br>teachings hath been thrown away by thee. O infamous one of the Kuru race,<br>desiring to praise Kesava, thou describest him before me as great and<br>superior in knowledge and in age, as if I knew nothing. If at thy word, O<br>Bhishma, one that hath slain women (meaning Putana) and kine be<br>worshipped, then what is to become of this great lesson? How can one who<br>is such, deserve praise, O Bhishma? 'This one is the foremost of all wise<br>men,&#8212;'This one is the lord of the universe'&#8212;hearing these words of<br>thine, Janarddana believeth that these are all true. But surely, they are<br>all false. The verses that a chanter sings, even if he sings them often,<br>produce no impression on him. And every creature acts according to his<br>disposition, even like the bird Bhulinga (that picks the particles of<br>flesh from between the lion's teeth, though preaching against rashness).<br>Assuredly thy disposition is very mean. There is not the least doubt<br>about it. And so also, it seemeth, that the sons of Pandu who regard<br>Krishna as deserving of worship and who have thee for their guide, are<br>possessed of a sinful disposition. Possessing a knowledge of virtue, thou<br>hast fallen off from the path of the wise. Therefore thou art sinful.<br>Who, O Bhishma, knowing himself to be virtuous and superior in knowledge,<br>will so act as thou hast done from motives of virtue? If thou knowest the<br>ways of the morality, if thy mind is guided by wisdom, blessed be thou.<br>Why then, O Bhishma, was that virtuous girl Amva, who had set her heart<br>upon another, carried off by thee, so proud of wisdom and virtue? Thy<br>brother Vichitravirya conformably to the ways of the honest and the<br>virtuous, knowing that girl's condition, did not marry her though brought<br>by thee. Boasting as thou dost of virtue, in thy very sight, upon the<br>widow of thy brother were sons begotten by another according to the ways<br>of the honest. Where is thy virtue, O Bhishma? This thy celebacy, which<br>thou leadest either from ignorance or from impotence, is fruitless. O<br>thou who art conversant with virtue, I do not behold thy well-being. Thou<br>who expoundest morality in this way dost not seem to have ever waited<br>upon the old. Worship, gift, study,&#8212;sacrifices distinguished by large<br>gifts to the Brahmanas,&#8212;these all equal not in merit even one-sixteenth<br>part of that which is obtainable by the possession of a son. The merit, O<br>Bhishma, that is acquired by numberless vows and fasts assuredly becomes<br>fruitless in the case of one that is childless. Thou art childless and<br>old and the expounder of false morality. Like the swan in the story, thou<br>shalt now die at the hands of thy relatives. Other men possessed of<br>knowledge have said this of old. I will presently recite it fully in thy<br>hearing.<br><br>"There lived of yore an old swan on the sea-coast. Ever speaking of<br>morality, but otherwise in his conduct, he used to instruct the feathery<br>tribe. Practise ye virtue and forego sin,&#8212;these were the words that<br>other truthful birds, O Bhishma, constantly heard him utter And the other<br>oviparous creatures ranging the sea, it hath been heard by us, O Bhishma<br>use for virtue's sake to bring him food. And, O Bhishma, all those other<br>birds, keeping their eggs, with him, ranged and dived in the waters of<br>the sea. And the sinful old swan, attentive to his own pursuits, used to<br>eat up the eggs of all those birds that foolishly trusted in him. After a<br>while when the eggs were decreasing in number, a bird of great wisdom had<br>his suspicions roused and he even witnessed (the affair) one day. And<br>having witnessed the sinful act of the old swan, that bird in great<br>sorrow spoke unto all the other birds. Then, O thou best of the Kurus,<br>all those birds witnessing with their own eyes the act of the old swan,<br>approached that wretch of false conduct and slew him.<br><br>"Thy behaviour, O Bhishma, is even like that of the old swan. These lords<br>of earth might slay thee in anger like those creatures of the feathery<br>tribe slaying the old swan. Persons conversant with the Puranas recite a<br>proverb, O Bhishma, as regards this occurrence, I shall, O Bharata,<br>repeat it to thee fully. It is even this: O thou that supportest thyself<br>on thy wings, though thy heart is affected (by the passions), thou<br>preachest yet (of virtue); but this thy sinful act of eating up the eggs<br>transgresseth thy speech!"
