                            "Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'O king, thou art our master. Command us as to what<br>we shall do. O Bharata, we desire to remain always in obedience to thee.<br><br>"Dhritarashtra replied.&#8212;'O Ajatasatru, blest be thou. Go thou in peace<br>and safety. Commanded by me, go, rule thy own kingdom with thy wealth.<br>And, O child, take to heart this command of an old man, this wholesome<br>advice that I give, and which is even a nutritive regimen. O<br>Yudhishthira, O child, thou knowest the subtle path of morality.<br>Possessed of great wisdom, thou art also humble, and thou waitest also<br>upon the old. Where there is intelligence, there is forbearance.<br>Therefore, O Bharata, follow thou counsels of peace. The axe falleth upon<br>wood, not upon stone. (Thou art open to advice, not Duryodhana). They are<br>the best of men that remember not the acts of hostility of their foes;<br>that behold only the merits, not the faults, of their enemies; and that<br>never enter into hostilities themselves. They that are good remember only<br>the good deeds of their foes and not the hostile acts their foes might<br>have done unto them. The good, besides, do good unto others without<br>expectation of any good, in return. O Yudhishthira, it is only the worst<br>of men that utter harsh words in quarrelling; while they that are<br>indifferent reply to such when spoken by others. But they that are good<br>and wise never think of or recapitulate such harsh words, little caring<br>whether these may or may not have been uttered by their foes. They that<br>are good, having regard to the state of their own feelings, can<br>understand the feelings of others, and therefore remember only the good<br>deeds and not the acts of hostility of their foes. Thou hast acted even<br>as good men of prepossessing countenance do, who transgress not the<br>limits of virtue, wealth, pleasure and salvation. O child, remember not<br>the harsh words of Duryodhana. Look at thy mother Gandhari and myself<br>also, if thou desirest to remember only what is good. O Bharata, look at<br>me, who am thy father unto you and am old and blind, and still alive. It<br>was for seeing our friends and examining also the strength and weakness<br>of my children, that I had, from motives of policy, suffered this match<br>at dice to proceed. O king those amongst the Kurus that have thee for<br>their ruler, and the intelligent Vidura conversant with every branch of<br>learning for their counsellor, have, indeed, nothing to grieve for. In<br>thee is virtue, in Arjuna is patience, in Bhimasena is prowess, and the<br>twins, those foremost of men, is pure reverence for superiors. Blest be<br>thou, O Ajatasatru. Return to Khandavaprastha, and let there be brotherly<br>love between thee and thy cousins. Let thy heart also be ever fixed on<br>virtue.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"That foremost of the Bharatas&#8212;king<br>Yudhishthira the just&#8212;then, thus addressed by his uncle, having gone<br>through every ceremony of politeness, set out with his brothers for<br>Khandavaprastha. And accompanied by Draupadi and ascending their cars<br>which were all of the hue of the clouds, with cheerful hearts they all<br>set out for that best of cities called Indraprastha."
