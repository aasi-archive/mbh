                            (Rajasuyarambha Parva)<br><br>"Krishna said,&#8212;'O great king, thou art a worthy possessor of all the<br>qualities essential for the performance of the Rajasuya sacrifice. Thou<br>knowest everything, O Bharata. I shall, however, still tell thee<br>something. Those persons in the world that now go by the name of<br>Kshatriyas are inferior (in everything) to those Kshatriyas that Rama,<br>the son of Jamadagnya, exterminated.' O lord of the earth, O bull of the<br>Bharata race, thou knowest what form of rule these Kshatriyas, guided by<br>the instructions traditionally handed down from generation to generation,<br>have established amongst their own order, and how far they are competent<br>to perform the Rajasuya sacrifice. The numerous royal lines and other<br>ordinary Kshatriyas all represent themselves to be the descendants of<br>Aila and Ikshwaku. The descendants of Aila, O king, as, indeed, the kings<br>of Ikshwaku's race, are, know O bull of the Bharata race, each divided<br>into a hundred separate dynasties. The descendants of Yayati and the<br>Bhojas are great, both in extent (number) and accomplishments. O king,<br>these last are to-day scattered all over the earth. And all the<br>Kshatriyas worship the prosperity of those monarchs. At present, however,<br>O monarch, king Jarasandha, overcoming that prosperity enjoyed by their<br>whole order, and overpowering them by his energy hath set himself over<br>the heads of all these kings. And Jarasandha, enjoying the sovereignty<br>over the middle portion of the earth (Mathura), resolved to create a<br>disunion amongst ourselves. O monarch, the king who is the lord paramount<br>of all kings, and in whom alone the dominion of the universe is centered,<br>properly deserves to be called an emperor. And, O monarch, king Sisupala<br>endued with great energy, hath placed himself under his protection and<br>hath become the generalissimo of his forces. And, O great king, the<br>mighty Vaka, the king of the Karushas, capable of fighting by putting<br>forth his powers of illusion, waiteth, upon Jarasandha, as his disciple.<br>There are two others, Hansa and Dimvaka, of great energy and great soul,<br>who have sought the shelter of the mighty Jarasandha. There are others<br>also viz., Dantavakra, Karusha, Karava, Meghavahana, that wait upon<br>Jarasandha. He also that beareth on his head that gem which is known as<br>the most wonderful on earth, that king of the Yavanas, who hath chastised<br>Muru and Naraka, whose power is unlimited, and who ruleth the west like<br>another Varuna, who is called Bhagadatta, and who is the old friend of<br>thy father, hath bowed his head before Jarasandha, by speech and<br>specially by act. In his heart, however, tied as he is by affection to<br>thee, he regardeth thee as a father regardeth his child. O king, that<br>lord of the earth who hath his dominions on the west and the south, who<br>is thy maternal uncle and who is called Purujit, that brave perpetuator<br>of the Kunti race, that slayer of all foes, is the single king that<br>regardeth thee from affection. He whom I did not formerly slay, that<br>wicked wretch amongst the Chedis, who represented himself in this world<br>as a divine personage and who hath become known also as such, and who<br>always beareth, from foolishness, the signs that distinguish me that king<br>of Vanga Pundra and the Kiratas, endowed with great strength, and who is<br>known on earth by the names of Paundraka and Vasudeva hath also espoused<br>the side of Jarasandha. And, O king of kings, Bhishmaka, the mighty king<br>of the Bhojas&#8212;the friend of Indra&#8212;the slayer of hostile heroes&#8212;who<br>governs a fourth part of the world, who by his learning conquered the<br>Pandyas and the Kratha-Kausikas, whose brother the brave Akriti was like<br>Rama, the son of Jamdagni, hath become a servitor to the king of Magadha.<br>We are his relatives and are, therefore, engaged everyday in doing what<br>is agreeable unto him. But although we regard him much, still he<br>regardeth us not and is engaged in doing us ill. And, O king, without<br>knowing his own strength and the dignity of the race to which he<br>belongeth, he hath placed himself under Jarasandha's shelter at sight of<br>the latter's blazing fame alone. And, O exalted one, the eighteen tribes<br>of the Bhojas, from fear of Jarasandha, have all fled towards the west;<br>so also have the Surasenas, the Bhadrakas, the Vodhas, the Salwas, the<br>Patachchavas, the Susthalas, the Mukuttas, and the Kulindas, along with<br>the Kuntis. And the king of the Salwayana tribe with their brethren and<br>followers; and the southern Panchalas and the eastern Kosalas have all<br>fled to the country of the Kuntis. So also the Matsyas and the<br>Sannyastapadas, overcome with fear, leaving their dominions in the north,<br>have fled into the southern country. And so all the Panchalas, alarmed at<br>the power of Jarasandha, have left their own kingdom and fled in all<br>directions. Some time before, the foolish Kansa, having persecuted the<br>Yadavas, married two of the daughters of Jarasandha. They are called Asti<br>and Prapti and are the sister of Sahadeva. Strengthened by such an<br>alliance, the fool persecuting his relatives gained an ascendency over<br>them all. But by this conduct he earned great obloquy. The wretch also<br>began to oppress the old kings of the Bhoja tribe, but they, to protect<br>themselves from the persecution of their relative, sought our help.<br>Having bestowed upon Akrura the handsome daughter of Ahuka, with<br>Sankarshana as my second I did a service to my relatives, for both Kansa<br>and Sunaman were slain by me assisted by Rama. But after the immediate<br>cause of fear was removed (by the death of Kansa), Jarasandha, his<br>father-in-law, took up arms. Ourselves consisting of the eighteen younger<br>branches of the Yadavas arrived at the conclusion that even if we struck<br>our enemies continually with excellent weapons capable of taking the<br>lives of the foes, we should still be unable to do anything unto him even<br>in three hundred years. He hath two friends that are like unto the<br>immortals, and in point of strength the foremost of all men endued with<br>might. They are called Hansa and Dimvaka who are both incapable of being<br>slain by weapons. The mighty Jarasandha, being united with them, becomes<br>incapable, I think, of being vanquished by even the three worlds. O thou<br>foremost of all intelligent men, this is not our opinion alone but all<br>other kings also are of the same mind. There lived, O monarch, a king of<br>the name of Hansa, who was slain by Rama (Valadeva) after a battle of<br>eighteen days. But, O Bharata, hearing people say that Hansa had been<br>killed, Dimvaka, O king, thought that he could not live without Hansa. He<br>accordingly jumped into the waters of the Yamuna and killed himself.<br>Afterwards when Hansa, the subjugator of hostile heroes, heard that<br>Dimvaka, had killed himself, he went to the Yamuna and jumped into its<br>waters. Then, O bull of the Bharata race, king Jarasandha, hearing that<br>both Hansa and Dimvaka had been killed, returned to his kingdom with an<br>empty heart. After Jarasandha had returned, O slayer of all foes, we were<br>filled with pleasure and continued to live at Mathura. Then the widow of<br>Hansa and the daughter of Jarasandha, that handsome woman with eyes like<br>lotus-petals, grieved at the death of her lord, went unto her father, and<br>repeatedly urged, O Monarch, the king of Magadha, saying,&#8212;O slayer of<br>all foes, kill thou the slayer of my husband.&#8212;Then, O great king,<br>remembering the conclusion to which we had come of old we became<br>exceedingly cheerless and fled from Mathura. Dividing our large wealth<br>into small portions so as to make each portion easily portable, we fled<br>from fear of Jarasandha, with our cousins and relatives. Reflecting upon<br>everything, we fled towards the west. There is a delightful town towards<br>the west called Kusasthali, adorned by the mountains of Raivata. In that<br>city, O monarch, we took up our abode. We rebuilt its fort and made it so<br>strong that it has become impregnable even to the Gods. And from within<br>it even the women might fight the foe, what to speak of the Yadava heroes<br>without fear of any kind? O slayer of all foes, we are now living in that<br>city. And, O tiger of the Kuru race, considering the inaccessibility of<br>that first of mountains and regarding themselves as having already<br>crossed the fear of Jarasandha, the descendants of Madhu have become<br>exceedingly glad. Thus, O king, though possessed of strength and energy,<br>yet from the oppressions of Jarasandha we have been obliged to repair to<br>the mountains of Gomanta, measuring three Yojanas in length. Within each<br>yojana have been established one and twenty posts of armed men. And at<br>intervals of each yojana are hundred gates with arches which are defended<br>by valourous heroes engaged in guarding them. And innumerable Kshatriyas<br>invincible in war, belonging to the eighteen younger branches of the<br>Yadavas, are employed in defending these works. In our race, O king,<br>there are full eighteen thousand brothers and cousins. Ahuka hath had a<br>hundred sons, each of whom is almost like a god (in prowess), Charudeshna<br>with his brother Chakradeva, Satyaki, myself, Valadeva the son of Rohini,<br>and my son Samva who is equal unto me in battle&#8212;these seven, O king are<br>Atirathas. Besides these, there are others, O king, whom I shall<br>presently name. They are Kritavarman, Anadhrishti, Samika, Samitinjaya,<br>Kanka, Sanku and Kunti. These seven are Maharathas. There are also two<br>sons of Andhakabhoja, and the old king himself. Endued with great energy<br>these are all heroes, each mighty as the thunderbolt. These Maharathas,<br>choosing the middle country, are now living amongst the Vrishnis. O thou<br>best of the Bharata line, thou alone art worthy of being an emperor. It<br>behoveth thee, O Bharata, to establish thy empire over all the<br>Kshatriyas. But this is my judgment, O king, that thou wilt not be able<br>to celebrate the Rajasuya sacrifice as long as the mighty Jarasandha<br>liveth. By him have been immured in his hillfort numerous monarchs, like<br>a lion that hath deposited the slain bodies of mighty elephants within a<br>cave of the king of mountains. O slayer of all enemies, king Jarasandha,<br>desirous of offering in sacrifice hundred monarchs, adored for his fierce<br>ascetic penances the illustrious god of gods, the lord of Uma. It is by<br>this means that the kings of the earth have been vanquished by<br>Jarasandha. And, O best of monarchs, he hath by that means been able to<br>fulfil the vow he had made relative to his sacrifice. By defeating the<br>kings with their troops and bringing all of them as captives into this<br>city, he had swelled its crowds enormously. We also, O king, from fear of<br>Jarasandha, at one time had to leave Mathura and fly to the city of<br>Dwaravati. If, O great king, thou desirest to perform this sacrifice,<br>strive to release the kings confined by Jarasandha, as also to compass<br>his death. O son of the Kuru race, otherwise this undertaking of thine<br>can never be completed. O thou foremost of intelligent men if the<br>Rajasuya is to be performed by thee, you must do this in this way and not<br>otherwise. This, O king, is my view (on the matter). Do, O sinless one,<br>as thou thinkest. Under these circumstances, O king, having reflected<br>upon everything, taking note of causes, tell us what thou thyself<br>thinkest proper."
