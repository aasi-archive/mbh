                            "Narada said,&#8212;'O Yudhisthira, I shall now describe the assembly house of<br>Yama, the son of Vivaswat, which, O son of Pritha, was built by<br>Viswakarma. Listen now to me. Bright as burnished gold, that assembly<br>house, O monarch, covers an area of much more than a hundred yojanas.<br>Possessed of the splendour of the sun, it yieldeth everything that one<br>may desire. Neither very cool nor very hot, it delighteth the heart. In<br>that assembly house there is neither grief nor weakness of age, neither<br>hunger nor thirst. Nothing disagreeable findeth a place there, nor any<br>kind of evil feelings there. Every object of desire, celestial or human,<br>is to be found in that mansion. And all kinds of enjoyable articles, as<br>also of sweet, juicy, agreeable, and delicious edibles in profusion that<br>are licked, sucked, and drunk, are there, O chastiser of all enemies. The<br>floral wreaths in that mansion are of the most delicious fragrance, and<br>the trees that stand around it yield fruits that are desired of them.<br>There are both cold and hot waters and these are sweet and agreeable. In<br>that mansion many royal sages of great sanctity and Brahmana sages also<br>of great purity, cheerfully wait upon, O child, and worship Yama, the son<br>of Vivaswat. And Yayati, Nahusha, Puru, Mandhatri, Somaka, Nriga; the<br>royal sage Trasadasyu, Kritavirya, Sautasravas; Arishtanemi, Siddha,<br>Kritavega, Kriti, Nimi, Pratarddana, Sivi, Matsya, Prithulaksha,<br>Vrihadratha, Vartta, Marutta, Kusika, Sankasya, Sankriti, Dhruva,<br>Chaturaswa, Sadaswormi and king Kartavirya; Bharata and Suratha, Sunitha,<br>Nisatha, Nala, Divodasa, and Sumanas, Amvarisha, Bhagiratha; Vyaswa,<br>Vadhraswa, Prithuvega, Prithusravas, Prishadaswa, Vasumanas, Kshupa, and<br>Sumahavala, Vrishadgu, and Vrishasena, Purukutsa, Dhwajin and Rathin;<br>Arshtisena, Dwilipa, and the high-souled Ushinara; Ausinari, Pundarika,<br>Saryati, Sarava, and Suchi; Anga, Rishta, Vena, Dushmanta, Srinjaya and<br>Jaya; Bhangasuri, Sunitha, and Nishada, and Bahinara; Karandhama,<br>Valhika, Sudymna, and the mighty Madhu; Aila and the mighty king of earth<br>Maruta; Kapota, Trinaka, and Shadeva, and Arjuna also. Vysawa; Saswa and<br>Krishaswa, and king Sasavindu; Rama the son of Dasaratha, and Lakshmana,<br>and Pratarddana; Alarka, and Kakshasena, Gaya, and Gauraswa; Rama the son<br>of Jamadagnya, Nabhaga, and Sagara; Bhuridyumna and Mahaswa, Prithaswa,<br>and also Janaka; king Vainya, Varisena, Purujit, and Janamejaya;<br>Brahmadatta, and Trigarta, and king Uparichara also; Indradyumna,<br>Bhimajanu, Gauraprishta, Nala, Gaya; Padma and Machukunda, Bhuridyumna,<br>Prasenajit; Aristanemi, Sudymna, Prithulauswa, and Ashtaka also; a<br>hundred kings of the Matsya race and hundred of the Vipa and a hundred of<br>the Haya races; a hundred kings of the name of Dhritarashtra, eighty<br>kings of the name of Janamejaya; a hundred monarchs called Brahmadatta,<br>and a hundred kings of the name of Iri; more than two hundred Bhishmas,<br>and also a hundred Bhimas; a hundred Prativindhyas, a hundred Nagas, and<br>a hundred Palasas, and a hundred called Kasa and Kusa; that king of kings<br>Santanu, and thy father Pandu, Usangava, Sata-ratha, Devaraja,<br>Jayadratha; the intelligent royal sage Vrishadarva with his ministers;<br>and a thousand other kings known by the name of Sasa-vindu, and who have<br>died, having performed many grand horse-sacrifices with large presents to<br>the Brahmanas&#8212;these holy royal sages of grand achievements and great<br>knowledge of the Sastras, wait upon, O King, and worship the son of<br>Vivaswat in that assembly house. And Agastya and Matanga, and Kala, and<br>Mrityu (Death), performers of sacrifices, the Siddhas, and many Yogins;<br>the Prtris (belonging to the classes&#8212;called Agniswattas, Fenapa,<br>Ushampa, Swadhavat, and Verhishada), as also those others that have<br>forms; the wheel of time, and the illustrious conveyer himself of the<br>sacrificial butter; all sinners among human beings, as also those that<br>have died during the winter solstice; these officers of Yama who have<br>been appointed to count the allotted days of everybody and everything;<br>the Singsapa, Palasa, Kasa, and Kusa trees and plants, in their embodied<br>forms, these all, O king, wait upon and worship the god of justice in<br>that assembly house of his. These and many others are present at the<br>Sabha of the king of the Pitris (manes). So numerous are they that I am<br>incapable of describing them either by mentioning their names or deeds. O<br>son of Pritha, the delightful assembly house, moving everywhere at the<br>will of its owner, is of wide extent. It was built by Viswakarma after a<br>long course of ascetic penances. And, O Bharata, resplendent with his own<br>effulgence, it stands glorified in all its beauty. Sannyasis of severe<br>ascetic penance, of excellent vows, and of truthful speech, peaceful and<br>pure and sanctified by holy deeds, of shining bodies and attired in<br>spotless robes, decked with bracelets and floral garlands, with ear-rings<br>of burnished gold, and adorned with their own holy acts as with the marks<br>of their order (painted over their bodies), constantly visit that Sabha<br>(Assembly). Many illustrious Gandharvas, and many Apsaras fill every part<br>of that mansion with music; both instrumental and vocal and with sounds<br>of laughter and dance. And, O son of Pritha, excellent perfumes, and<br>sweet sounds and garlands of celestial flowers always contribute towards<br>making that mansion supremely blest. And hundreds of thousands of<br>virtuous persons, of celestial beauty and great wisdom, always wait upon<br>and worship the illustrious Yama, the lord of created beings in that<br>assembly house. Such, O monarch, is the Sabha, of the illustrious king of<br>the Pitris! I shall now describe unto the assembly house of Varuna also<br>called Pushkaramalini!"
