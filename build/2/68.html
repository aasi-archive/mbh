                            Draupadi said,&#8212;'Wait a little, thou worst of men, thou wicked-minded<br>Dussasana. I have an act to perform&#8212;a high duty that hath not been<br>performed by me yet. Dragged forcibly by this wretch's strong arms, I was<br>deprived of my senses. I salute these reverend seniors in this assembly<br>of the Kurus. That I could not do this before cannot be my fault.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Dragged with greater force than before, the<br>afflicted and helpless Draupadi, undeserving of such treatment, falling<br>down upon the ground, thus wept in that assembly of the Kurus,&#8212;<br><br>"'Alas, only once before, on the occasion of the Swayamvara, I was beheld<br>by the assembled kings in the amphitheatre, and never even once beheld<br>afterwards. I am to-day brought before this assembly. She whom even the<br>winds and the sun had seen never before in her palace is to-day before<br>this assembly and exposed to the gaze of the crowd. Alas, she whom the<br>sons of Pandu could not, while in her palace, suffer to be touched even<br>by the wind, is to-day suffered by the Pandavas to be seized and dragged<br>by this wretch. Alas, these Kauravas also suffer their daughter-in-law,<br>so unworthy of such treatment, to be thus afflicted before them. It<br>seemeth that the times are out of joint. What can be more distressing to<br>me, than that though high-born and chaste, I should yet be compelled to<br>enter this public court? Where is that virtue for which these kings were<br>noted? It hath been heard that the kings of ancient days never brought<br>their wedded wives into the public court. Alas, that eternal usage hath<br>disappeared from among the Kauravas. Else, how is it that the chaste wife<br>of the Pandavas, the sister of Prishata's son, the friend of Vasudeva, is<br>brought before this assembly? Ye Kauravas, I am the wedded wife of king<br>Yudhishthira the just, hailing from the same dynasty to which the King<br>belonged. Tell me now if I am a serving-maid or otherwise. I will<br>cheerfully accept your answer. This mean wretch, this destroyer of the<br>name of the Kurus, is afflicting me hard. Ye Kauravas, I cannot bear it<br>any longer. Ye kings, I desire ye to answer whether ye regard me as won<br>or unwon. I will accept your verdict whatever it be.'<br><br>"Hearing these words, Bhishma answered, I have already said, O blessed<br>one that the course of morality is subtle. Even the illustrious wise in<br>this world fail to understand it always. What in this world a strong man<br>calls morality is regarded as such by others, however otherwise it may<br>really be; but what a weak man calls morality is scarcely regarded as<br>such even if it be the highest morality. From the importance of the issue<br>involved, from its intricacy and subtlety, I am unable to answer with<br>certitude the question thou hast asked. However, it is certain that as<br>all the Kurus have become the slaves of covetousness and folly, the<br>destruction of this our race will happen on no distant date. O blessed<br>one, the family into which thou hast been admitted as a daughter-in-law,<br>is such that those who are born in it, however much they might be<br>afflicted by calamities, never deviate from the paths of virtue and<br>morality. O Princess of Panchala, this conduct of thine also, viz. that<br>though sunk in distress, thou still easiest thy eyes on virtue and<br>morality, is assuredly worthy of thee. These persons, Drona and others,<br>of mature years and conversant with morality, sit heads downwards like<br>men that are dead, with bodies from which life hath departed. It seemeth<br>to me, however, that Yudhishthira is an authority on this question. It<br>behoveth him to declare whether thou art won or not won."
