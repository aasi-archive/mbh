                            Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"The kings present in that assembly, from tear of<br>Duryodhana, uttered not a word, good or ill, although they beheld<br>Draupadi crying piteously in affliction like a female osprey, and<br>repeatedly appealing to them. And the son of Dhritarashtra beholding<br>those kings and sons and grand sons of kings all remaining silent, smiled<br>a little, and addressing the daughter of the king of Panchala, said,&#8212;O<br>Yajnaseni, the question thou hast put dependeth on thy husbands&#8212;on Bhima<br>of mighty strength, on Arjuna, on Nakula, on Sahadeva. Let them answer<br>thy question. O Panchali, let them for thy sake declare in the midst of<br>these respectable men that Yudhishthira is not their lord, let them<br>thereby make king Yudhishthira the just a liar. Thou shalt then be freed<br>from the condition of slavery. Let the illustrious son of Dharma, always<br>adhering to virtue, who is even like Indra, himself declare whether he is<br>not thy lord. At his words, accept thou the Pandavas or ourselves without<br>delay. Indeed, all the Kauravas present in this assembly are floating in<br>the ocean of thy distress. Endued with magnanimity, they are unable to<br>answer thy question, looking at thy unfortunate husbands.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Hearing these words of the Kuru king, all who<br>were present in the assembly loudly applauded them. And shouting<br>approvingly, they made signs unto one another by motions of their eyes<br>and lips. And amongst some that were there, sounds of distress such as<br>'O! and 'Alas!" were heard. And at these words of Duryodhana, so<br>delightful (to his partisans), the Kauravas present in that assembly<br>became exceedingly glad. And the kings, with faces turned sideways,<br>looked upon Yudhishthira conversant with the rules of morality, curious<br>to hear what he would say. And every one present in that assembly became<br>curious to hear what Arjuna, the son of Pandu never defeated in battle,<br>and what Bhimasena, and what the twins also would say. And when that busy<br>hum of many voices became still, Bhimasena, waving his strong and<br>well-formed arms smeared with sandalpaste spake these words,&#8212;'If this<br>high-souled king Yudhishthira the just, who is our eldest brother, had<br>not been our lord, we would never have forgiven the Kuru race (for all<br>this). He is the lord of all our religious and ascetic merits, the lord<br>of even our lives. If he regardeth himself as won, we too have all been<br>won. If this were not so, who is there amongst creatures touching the<br>earth with their feet and mortal, that would escape from me with his life<br>after having touched those locks of the princess of Panchala? Behold<br>these mighty, well-formed arms of mine, even like maces of iron. Having<br>once come within them, even he of a hundred sacrifices is incapable of<br>effecting an escape. Bound by the ties of virtue and the reverence that<br>is due to our eldest brother, and repeatedly urged by Arjuna to remain<br>silent, I am not doing anything terrible. If however, I am once commanded<br>by king Yudhishthira the just, I would slay these wretched sons of<br>Dhritarashtra, making slaps do the work of swords, like a lion slaying a<br>number of little animals."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Unto Bhima who had spoken these words Bhishma<br>and Drona and Vidura said, 'Forbear, O Bhima. Everything is possible with<br>thee.'"
