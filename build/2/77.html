                            Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'I bid farewell unto all the Bharatas, unto my old<br>grand-sire (Bhishma), king Somadatta, the great king Vahlika, Drona,<br>Kripa, all the other kings, Aswathaman, Vidura, Dhritarashtra, all the<br>sons of Dhritarashtra, Yayutsu, Sanjaya, and all the courtiers, I bid<br>fare well, all of ye and returning again I shall see you."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Overcome with shame none of those that were<br>present there, could tell Yudhishthira anything. Within their hearts,<br>however, they prayed for the welfare of that intelligent prince.<br><br>Vidura then said,&#8212;The reverend Pritha is a princess by birth. It<br>behoveth her not to go into the woods. Delicate and old and ever known to<br>happiness the blessed one will live, respected by me, in my abode. Known<br>this, ye sons of Pandu. And let safety be always yours.'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;'The Pandavas thereupon said,&#8212;O sinless one,<br>let it be as thou sayest. Thou art our uncle, and, therefore like as our<br>father. We also are all obedient to thee. Thou art, O learned one, our<br>most respected superior. We should always obey what thou choosest to<br>command. And, O high-souled one, order thou whatever else there is that<br>remaineth to be done.<br><br>"Vidura replied,&#8212;'O Yudhishthira, O bull of the Bharata race, know this<br>to be my opinion, that one that is vanquished by sinful means need not be<br>pained by such defeat. Thou knowest every rule of morality; Dhananjaya is<br>ever victorious in battle; Bhimasena is the slayer of foes; Nakula is the<br>gatherer of wealth; Sahadeva hath administrative talents, Dhaumya is the<br>foremost of all conversant with the vedas; and the well-behaved Draupadi<br>is conversant with virtue and economy. Ye are attached to one another and<br>feel delight at one another's sight and enemies can not separate you from<br>one another, and ye are contented. Therefore, who is there that will not<br>envy ye? O Bharata, this patient abstraction from the possession of the<br>world will be of great benefit to thee. No foe, even if he were equal to<br>sakra himself, will be able to stand it. Formerly thou wert instructed on<br>the mountains of Himavat by Meru Savarni; in the town of Varanavata by<br>Krishna Dwaipayana; on the cliff of Bhrigu by Rama; and on the banks of<br>the Dhrishadwati by Sambhu himself. Thou hast also listened to the<br>instruction of the great Rishi Asita on the hills of Anjana; and thou<br>becamest a disciple of Bhrigu on the banks of the Kalmashi. Narada and<br>this thy priest Dhaumya will now become thy instructors. In the matter of<br>the next world, abandon not these excellent lessons thou hast obtained<br>from the Rishis. O son of Pandu. thou surpassest in intelligence even<br>Pururavas, the son of Ila; in strength, all other monarchs, and in<br>virtue, even the Rishis. Therefore, resolve thou earnestly to win<br>victory, which belongeth to Indra; to control thy wrath, which belongeth<br>to Yama; to give in charity, which belongeth to Kuvera; and to control<br>all passions, which belongeth to Varuna. And, O Bharata, obtain thou the<br>power of gladdening from the moon, the power of sustaining all from<br>water; forbearance from the earth; energy from the entire solar disc;<br>strength from the winds, and affluence from the other elements. Welfare<br>and immunity from ailment be thine; I hope to see thee return. And, O<br>Yudhishthira, act properly and duly in all seasons,&#8212;in those of<br>distress&#8212;in those of difficulty,&#8212;indeed, in respect of everything, O<br>son of Kunti, with our leave go hence. O Bharata, blessing be thine. No<br>one can say that ye have done anything sinful before. We hope to see<br>thee, therefore, return in safety and crowned with success."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Thus addressed by Vidura, Yudhishthira the son<br>of Pandu, of prowess incapable of being baffled, saying, 'So be it,'<br>bowing low unto Bhishma and Drona, went away."
