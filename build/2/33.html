                            Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"the ever-victorious Nakula, the son of Pandu, having<br>reached Hastinapura, formally invited Bhishma and Dhritarashtra. The<br>elder of the Kuru race with the preceptor at their head, invited with due<br>ceremonies, came with joyous hearts to that sacrifice, with Brahmanas<br>walking before them. And, O hull of the Bharata race, having heard of<br>king Yudhishthira's sacrifice, hundreds of other Kshatriyas acquainted<br>with the nature of the sacrifice, with joyous hearts came there from<br>various countries, desiring to behold king Yudhishthira the son of Pandu<br>and his sacrificial mansion, and brought with them many costly jewels of<br>various kinds. And Dhritarashtra and Bhishma and Vidura of high<br>intelligence; and all Kaurava brothers with Duryyodhana at their head;<br>and Suvala the king of Gandhara and Sakuni endued with great strength;<br>and Achala, and Vrishaka, and Karna that foremost of all charioteers; and<br>Salya endued with great might and the strong Valhika; and Somadatta, and<br>Bhuri of the Kuru race, and Bhurisravas and Sala; and Aswatthama, Kripa,<br>Drona, and Jayadratha, the ruler of Sindhu; and Yajnasena with his sons,<br>and Salya that lord of earth and that great car warrior king Bhagadatta<br>of Pragjyotisha accompanied by all Mlechcha tribes inhabiting the marshy<br>regions on the sea-shore; and many mountain kings, and king Vrihadvala;<br>and Vasudeva the king of the Paundrayas, and the kings of Vanga and<br>Kalinga; and Akastha and Kuntala and the kings of the Malavas and the<br>Andhrakas; and the Dravidas and the Singhalas and the king of Kashmira,<br>and king Kuntibhoja of great energy and king Gauravahana, and all the<br>other heroic kings of Valhika; and Virata with his two sons, and Mavella<br>endued with great might; and various kings and princes ruling in various<br>countries; and, O Bharata king Sisupala endued with great energy and<br>invincible in battle accompanied by his son&#8212;all of them came to the<br>sacrifice of the son of Pandu. And Rama and Aniruddha and Kanaka and<br>Sarana; and Gada, Pradyumna, Shamva, and Charudeshna of great energy; and<br>Ulmuka and Nishatha and the brave Angavaha; and innumerable other<br>Vrishnis&#8212;all mighty car-warriors&#8212;came there.<br><br>"These and many other kings from the middle country came, O monarch, to<br>that great Rajasuya sacrifice of the son of Pandu. And, O king, at the<br>command of king Yudhishthira the just, mansions were assigned to all<br>those monarchs, that were full of various kinds of edibles and adorned<br>with tanks and tall trees. And the son of Dharma worshipped all those<br>illustrious monarchs as they deserved. Worshipped by the king they<br>retired to mansions that were assigned to them. Those mansions were<br>(white and high) like the cliffs of Kailasa, and delightful to behold,<br>and furnished with every kind of furniture. They were enclosed on all<br>sides with well-built and high white-washed walls; their windows were<br>covered with net-works of gold and their interiors were furnished with<br>rows of pearls, their flights of stairs were easy of ascent and the<br>floors were all laid over with costly carpets. They were all hung over<br>with garlands of flowers and perfumed with excellent aloes. White as snow<br>or the moon, they looked extremely handsome even from the distance of a<br>yojana. Their doors and entrances were set uniformly and were wide enough<br>to admit a crowd of persons. Adorned with various costly articles and<br>built with various metals, they looked like peaks of the Himavat. Having<br>rested a while in those mansions the monarchs beheld king Yudhishthira<br>the just surrounded by numerous Sadasyas (sacrificial priests) and ever<br>performing sacrifices distinguished by large gifts to Brahmanas. That<br>sacrificial mansion wherein were present the kings and Brahmanas and<br>great Rishis looked, O king, as handsome as heaven itself crowded with<br>the gods!"<br><br>Thus ends the thirty-fourth section in the Rajasuyika Parva of the Sabha<br>Parva.
