                            Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"defeated at dice, after the Pandavas had gone to the<br>woods, Dhritarashtra, O king, was overcome with anxiety. And while he was<br>seated restless with anxiety and sighing in grief, Sanjaya approaching<br>him said, 'O lord of the earth having now obtained the whole earth with<br>all its wealth and sent away the sons of Pandu into exile, why is it, O<br>king, that thou grievest so?"<br><br>Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;'What have they not to grieve for who will have to<br>encounter in battle those bulls among warriors&#8212;the sons of<br>Pandu&#8212;fighting on great cars and aided by allies?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said,&#8212;"O king, all this great hostility is inevitable on<br>account of thy mistaken action, and this will assuredly bring about the<br>wholesale destruction of the whole world. Forbidden by Bhishma, by Drona,<br>and by Vidura, thy wicked-minded and shameless son Duryodhana sent his<br>Suta messenger commanding him to bring into court the beloved and<br>virtuous wife of the Pandavas. The gods first deprive that man of his<br>reason unto whom they send defeat and disgrace. It is for this that such<br>a person seeth things in a strange light. When destruction is at hand,<br>evil appeareth as good unto the understanding polluted by sin, and the<br>man adhereth to it firmly. That which is improper appeareth as proper,<br>and that which is proper appeareth as improper unto the man about to be<br>overwhelmed by destruction, and evil and impropriety are what he liketh.<br>The time that bringeth on destruction doth not come with upraised club<br>and smash one's head. On the other hand the peculiarity of such a time is<br>that it maketh a man behold evil in good and good in evil. The wretches<br>have brought on themselves this terrible, wholesale, and horrible<br>destruction by dragging the helpless princess of Panchala into the court.<br>Who else than Duryodhana&#8212;that false player of dice could bring into the<br>assembly, with insults, the daughter of Drupada, endued with beauty and<br>intelligence, and conversant with every rule of morality and duty, and<br>sprung not from any woman's womb but from the sacred fire? The handsome<br>Krishna, then in her season, attired in one piece of stained cloth when<br>brought into the court cast her eyes upon the Pandavas. She beheld them,<br>however, robbed of their wealth, of their kingdom, of even their attire,<br>of their beauty, of every enjoyment, and plunged into a state of bondage.<br>Bound by the tie of virtue, they were then unable to exert their prowess.<br>And before all the assembled kings Duryodhana and Karna spake cruel and<br>harsh words unto the distressed and enraged Krishna undeserving of such<br>treatment. O monarch, all this appeareth to me as foreboding fearful<br>consequences.'<br><br>Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;'O Sanjaya, the glances of the distressed daughter<br>of Drupada might consume the whole earth. Can it be possible that even a<br>single son of mine will live? The wives of the Bharatas, uniting with<br>Gandhari upon beholding virtuous Krishna, the wedded wife of the<br>Pandavas, endued with beauty and youth, dragged into the court, set up<br>frightful wail. Even now, along with all my subjects, they weep every<br>day. Enraged at the ill treatment of Draupadi, the Brahmanas in a body<br>did not perform that evening their Agnihotra ceremony. The winds blew<br>mightily as they did at the time of the universal dissolution. There was<br>a terrible thunder-storm also. Meteors fell from the sky, and Rahu by<br>swallowing the Sun unseasonably alarmed the people terribly. Our<br>war-chariots were suddenly ablaze, and all their flagstaffs fell down<br>foreboding evil unto the Bharatas. Jackals began to cry frightfully from<br>within the sacred fire-chamber of Duryodhana, and asses from all<br>directions began to bray in response. Then Bhishma and Drona, and Kripa,<br>and Somadatta and the high-souled Vahlika, all left the assembly. It was<br>then that at the advice of Vidura I addressed Krishna and said, 'I will<br>grant thee boons, O Krishna, indeed, whatever thou wouldst ask? The<br>princess of the Panchala there begged of me the liberation of the<br>Pandavas. Out of my own motion I then set free the Pandavas, commanding<br>them to return (to their capital) on their cars and with their bows and<br>arrows. It was then that Vidura told me, 'Even this will prove the<br>destruction of the Bharata race, viz., this dragging of Krishna into the<br>court. This daughter of the King of Panchala is the faultless Sree<br>herself. Of celestial origin, she is the wedded wife of the Pandavas. The<br>wrathful sons of Pandu will never forgive this insult offered unto her.<br>Nor will the mighty bowmen of the Vrishni race, nor the mighty warriors<br>amongst the Panchalas suffer this in silence. Supported by Vasudeva of<br>unbaffled prowess, Arjuna will assuredly come back, surrounded by the<br>Panchala host. And that mighty warrior amongst them, Bhimasena endued<br>with surpassing strength, will also come back, whirling his mace like<br>Yama himself with his club. These kings will scarcely be able to bear the<br>force of Bhima's mace. Therefore, O king, not hostility but peace for<br>ever with the sons of Pandu is what seemeth to me to be the best. The<br>sons of Pandu are always stronger than the Kurus. Thou knowest, O king,<br>that the illustrious and mighty king Jarasandha was slain in battle by<br>Bhima with his bare arms alone. Therefore, O bull of the Bharata race, it<br>behoveth thee to make peace with the sons of Pandu. Without scruples of<br>any kind, unite the two parties, O king. And it thou actest in this way,<br>thou art sure to obtain good luck, O king. It was thus, O son of<br>Gavalgani, that Vidura addressed me in words of both virtue and profit.<br>And I did not accept this counsel, moved by affection for my son."<br><br>The End of Sabha Parva
