                            Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;thus addressed, Dhananjaya replied unto<br>Bhagadatta, saying,&#8212;'If thou wilt give thy promise to do this, thou hast<br>done all I desire. And having thus subjugated the king of Pragjyotisha,<br>Dhananjaya of long arms, the son of Kunti, then marched towards the<br>north&#8212;the direction presided over by the lord of treasures. That bull<br>amongst men, that son of Kunti, then conquered the mountainous tracts and<br>their outskirts, as also the hilly regions. And having conquered all the<br>mountains and the kings that reigned there, and bringing them under his<br>sway, he exacted tributes from all. And winning the affections of those<br>kings and uniting himself with them, he next marched, O king, against<br>Vrihanta, the king of Uluka, making this earth tremble with the sound of<br>his drums, the clatter of his chariot-wheels, and the roar of the<br>elephants in his train. Vrihanta, however, quickly coming out of his city<br>followed by his army consisting of four kinds of troops, gave battle to<br>Falguna (Arjuna). And the fight that took place between Vrihanta and<br>Dhananjaya was terrible. It so happened that Vrihanta was unable to bear<br>the prowess of the son of Pandu. Then that invincible king of the<br>mountainous region regarding the son of Kunti irresistible, approached<br>him with all his wealth. Arjuna snatched out the kingdom from Vrihanta,<br>but having made peace with him marched, accompanied by that king, against<br>Senavindu whom he soon expelled from his kingdom. After this he<br>subjugated Modapura, Vamadeva, Sudaman, Susankula, the Northern Ulukas,<br>and the kings of those countries and peoples. Hereafter at the command of<br>Yudhishthira, O monarch, Arjuna, did not move from the city of Senavindu<br>but sent his troops only and brought under his sway those five countries<br>and peoples. For Arjuna, having arrived at Devaprastha, the city of<br>Senavindu, took up his quarters there with his army consisting of four<br>kinds of forces. Thence, surrounded by the kings and the peoples he had<br>subjugated, the hero marched against king Viswagaswa&#8212;that bull of Puru's<br>race. Having vanquished in battle the brave mountaineers, who were all<br>great warriors, the son of Pandu, O king, then occupied with the help of<br>his troops, the town protected by the Puru king. Having vanquished in<br>battle the Puru king, as also the robber tribes, of the mountains, the<br>son of Pandu brought under his sway the seven tribes called<br>Utsava-sanketa. That bull of the Kshatriya race then defeated the brave<br>Kshatriyas of Kashmira and also king Lohita along with ten minor chiefs.<br>Then the Trigartas, the Daravas, the Kokonadas, and various other<br>Kshatriyas, O king, advanced against the son of Pandu. That Prince of the<br>Kuru race then took the delightful town of Avisari, and then brought<br>under his sway Rochamana ruling in Uraga. Then the son of Indra (Arjuna),<br>putting forth his might, pressed the delightful town of Singhapura that<br>was well-protected with various weapons. Then Arjuna, that bull amongst<br>the son of Pandu, at the head of all his troops, fiercely attacked the<br>regions called Suhma and Sumala. Then the son of Indra, endued with great<br>prowess, after pressing them with great force, brought the Valhikas<br>always difficult of being vanquished, under his sway. Then Falguna, the<br>son of Pandu, taking with him a select force, defeated the Daradas along<br>with the Kambojas. Then the exalted son of Indra vanquished the robber<br>tribes that dwelt in the north-eastern frontier and those also that dwelt<br>in the woods. And, O great king, the son of Indra also subjugated the<br>allied tribes of the Lohas, the eastern Kambojas, and northern Rishikas.<br>And the battle with the Rishikas was fierce in the extreme. Indeed, the<br>fight that took place between them and the son of Pritha was equal to<br>that between the gods and the Asuras in which Taraka (the wife of<br>Vrihaspati) had become the cause of so much slaughter. And defeating, O<br>king, the Rishikas in the field of battle, Arjuna took from them as<br>tribute eight horses that were of the colour of the parrot's breast, as<br>also other horses of the hues of the peacock, born in northern and other<br>climes and endued with high speed. At last having conquered all the<br>Himalayas and the Nishkuta mountains, that bull among men, arriving at<br>the White mountains, encamped on its breast."
