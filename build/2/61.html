                            Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"During the course of this gambling, certain to bring<br>about utter ruin (on Yudhishthira), Vidura, that dispeller of all doubts,<br>(addressing Dhritarashtra) said, 'O great king, O thou of the Bharata<br>race, attend to what I say, although my words may not be agreeable to<br>thee, like medicine to one that is ill and about to breathe his last.<br>When this Duryodhana of sinful mind had, immediately after his birth,<br>cried discordantly like a jackal, it was well known that he had been<br>ordained to bring about the destruction of the Bharata race. Know, O<br>king, that he will be the cause of death of ye all. A jackal is living in<br>thy house, O king, in the form of Duryodhana. Thou knowest it not in<br>consequence of thy folly. Listen now to the words of the Poet (Sukra)<br>which I will quote. They that collect honey (in mountains), having<br>received what they seek, do not notice that they are about to fall.<br>Ascending dangerous heights, abstracted in the pursuit of what they seek,<br>they fall down and meet with destruction. This Duryodhana also, maddened<br>with the play at dice, like the collector of honey, abstracted in what he<br>seeketh, marketh not the consequences. Making enemies of these great<br>warriors, he beholdeth not the fall that is before him. It is known to<br>thee, O thou of great wisdom, that amongst the Bhojas, they abandoned,<br>for the good of the citizens a son that was unworthy of their race. The<br>Andhakas, the Yadavas, and the Bhojas uniting together, abandoned Kansa.<br>And afterwards, when at the command of the whole tribe, the same Kansa<br>had been slain by Krishna that slayer of foes, all the men of the tribe<br>became exceedingly happy for a hundred years. So at thy command, let<br>Arjuna slay this Suyodhana. And in consequence of the slaying of this<br>wretch, let the Kurus be glad and pass their days in happiness. In<br>exchange of a crow, O great king, buy these peacocks&#8212;the Pandavas; and<br>in exchange of a jackal, buy these tigers. For the sake of a family a<br>member may be sacrificed; for the sake of a village a family may be<br>sacrificed, for the sake of a province a village may be sacrificed and<br>for the sake of one's own soul the whole earth may be sacrificed. Even<br>this was what the omniscient Kavya himself, acquainted with the thoughts<br>of every creature, and a source of terror unto all foes, said unto the<br>great Asuras to induce them to abandon Jambha at the moment of his birth.<br>It is said that a certain king, having caused a number of wild birds that<br>vomited gold to take up their quarters in his own house, afterwards<br>killed them from temptation. O slayer of foes, blinded by temptation and<br>the desire of enjoyment, for the sake of gold, the king destroyed at the<br>same time both his present and future gains. Therefore, O king, prosecute<br>not the Pandavas from desire of profit, even like the king in story. For<br>then, blinded by folly thou wilt have to repent afterwards, even like the<br>person that killed the birds. Like a flower-seller that plucketh (many<br>flowers) in the garden from trees that he cherisheth with affection from<br>day to day, continue, O Bharata, to pluck flowers day by day from the<br>Pandavas. Do not scorch them to their roots like a fire-producing breeze<br>that reduceth everything to black charcoal. Go not, O king, unto the<br>region of Yama, with thy sons and troops, for who is there that is<br>capable of fighting with the sons of Pritha, together? Not to speak of<br>others, is the chief of the celestials at the head of the celestials<br>themselves, capable of doing so?"
