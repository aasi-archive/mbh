                            (Digvijaya Parva)<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;Arjuna, having obtained that best of bows and that<br>couple of inexhaustible quivers and that car and flag-staff, as also that<br>assembly-house, addressing Yudhisthira said,&#8212;Bow, weapons, great energy,<br>allies, territory, fame, army-those, O king, difficult of acquisition<br>however desirable, have all been obtained by me. I think, therefore, that<br>what should now be done is for the swelling up of our treasury. I desire,<br>O best of monarchs, to make the kings (of the earth) pay tributes to us.<br>I desire to set out, in an auspicious moment of a holy day of the moon<br>under a favourable constellation for the conquest of the direction that<br>is presided over by the Lord of treasures (viz. the North)."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"King Yudhisthira the just, hearing these words<br>of Dhananjaya, replied unto him in a grave and collected tone, saying,&#8212;O<br>bull of the Bharata race, set thou out, having made holy Brahmanas utter<br>benedictions on thee, to plunge thy enemies in sorrow and to fill thy<br>friend with joy. Victory, O son of Pritha, will surely be thine, and thou<br>wilt surely obtain thy desires fulfilled.<br><br>"Thus addressed, Arjuna, surrounded by a large host, set out in that<br>celestial car of wonderful achievements he had obtained from Agni. And<br>Bhimasena also, and those bull among men, the twins, dismissed with<br>affection by Yudhishthira the just set out, each at the head of a large<br>army. And Arjuna, the son of the chastiser of Paka then brought under<br>subjugation that direction (the North) which was presided over by the<br>Lord of treasures. And Bhimasena overcome by force the East and Sahadeva<br>the South, and Nakula, O king, acquainted with all the weapons, conquered<br>the West. Thus while his brothers were so employed, the exalted king<br>Yudishthira the just stayed within Khandavaprastha in the enjoyment of<br>great affluence in the midst of friends and relatives."<br><br>"Bhagadatta, hearing this, said,&#8212;'O thou who hast Kunto for thy mother,<br>as thou art to me, so is Yudhishthira also. I shall do all this. Tell me,<br>what else I may do for thee."
