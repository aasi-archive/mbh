                            (Sabhakriya Parva)<br><br>Om! After having bowed down to Narayana, and Nara, the most exalted male<br>being, and also to the goddess Saraswati, must the word Jaya be uttered.<br><br>"Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Then, in the presence of Vasudeva, Maya Danava,<br>having worshipped Arjuna, repeatedly spoke unto him with joined hands and<br>in amiable words,&#8212;'O son of Kunti, saved have I been by thee from this<br>Krishna in spate and from Pavaka (fire) desirous of consuming me. Tell me<br>what I have to do for thee.<br><br>"Arjuna said,&#8212;'O great Asura, everything hath already been done by thee<br>(even by this offer of thine). Blest be thou. Go whithersoever thou<br>likest. Be kind and well-disposed towards me, as we are even kind to and<br>well-pleased with thee!'<br><br>"Maya said,&#8212;'O bull amongst men, what thou hast said is worthy of thee,<br>O exalted one. But O Bharata, I desire to do something for thee<br>cheerfully. I am a great artist, a Viswakarma among the Danavas. O son of<br>Pandu, being what I am, I desire to do something for thee.'<br><br>"Arjuna said,&#8212;'O sinless one, thou regardest thyself as saved (by me)<br>from imminent death. Even if it hath been so, I cannot make thee do<br>anything for me. At the same time, O Danava, I do not wish to frustrate<br>thy intentions. Do thou something for Krishna. That will be a sufficient<br>requital for my services to thee.'<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Then, O bull of the Bharata race, urged by Maya,<br>Vasudeva reflected for a moment as to what he should ask Maya to<br>accomplish. Krishna, the Lord of the universe and the Creator of every<br>object, having reflected in his mind, thus commanded Maya,&#8212;'Let a<br>palatial sabha (meeting hall) as thou choosest, be built (by thee), if<br>thou, O son of Diti, who art the foremost of all artists, desirest to do<br>good to Yudhishthira the just. Indeed, build thou such a palace that<br>persons belonging to the world of men may not be able to imitate it even<br>after examining it with care, while seated within. And, O Maya, build<br>thou a mansion in which we may behold a combination of godly, asuric and<br>human designs.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Having heard those words, Maya became<br>exceedingly glad. And he forthwith built a magnificent palace for the son<br>of Pandu like unto the palace of the celestials themselves. Then Krishna<br>and Partha (Arjuna) after having narrated everything unto king<br>Yudhishthira the just, introduced Maya unto him. Yudhishthira received<br>Maya with respect, offering him the honour he deserved. And, O Bharata,<br>Maya accepted that honour thinking highly of it. O monarch of the Bharata<br>race, that great son of Diti then recited unto the sons of Pandu the<br>history of the Danava Vrisha-parva, and that foremost of artists then,<br>having rested awhile, set himself after much thoughtful planning to build<br>a palace for the illustrious sons of Pandu. Agreeably to the wishes of<br>both Krishna and the sons of Pritha, the illustrious Danava of great<br>prowess, having performed on an auspicious day the initial propitiatory<br>rites of foundation and having also gratified thousands of well-versed<br>Brahmanas with sweetened milk and rice and with rich presents of various<br>kinds, measured out a plot of land five thousand cubits square, which was<br>delightful and exceedingly handsome to behold and which was favourable<br>for construction of a building well-suited to the exigencies of every<br>season."
