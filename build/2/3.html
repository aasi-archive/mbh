                            "Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Then Maya Danava addressed Arjuna, that foremost of<br>successful warriors, saying,&#8212;'I now go with thy leave, but shall come<br>back soon. On the north of the Kailasa peak near the mountains of<br>Mainaka, while the Danavas were engaged in a sacrifice on the banks of<br>Vindu lake, I gathered a huge quantity of delightful and variegated vanda<br>(a kind of rough materials) composed of jewels and gems. This was placed<br>in the mansion of Vrishaparva ever devoted to truth. If it be yet<br>existing, I shall come back, O Bharata, with it. I shall then commence<br>the construction of the delightful palace of the Pandavas, which is to be<br>adorned with every kind of gems and celebrated all over the world. There<br>is also, I think, O thou of the Kuru race, a fierce club placed in the<br>lake Vindu by the King (of the Danavas) after slaughtering therewith all<br>his foes in battle. Besides being heavy and strong and variegated with<br>golden knobs, it is capable of bearing great weight, and of slaying all<br>foes, and is equal in strength unto an hundred thousand clubs. It is a<br>fit weapon for Bhima, even as the Gandiva is for thee. There is also (in<br>that lake) a large conch-shell called Devadatta of loud sound, that came<br>from Varuna. I shall no doubt give all these to thee. Having spoken thus<br>unto Partha, the Asura went away in a north-easterly direction. On the<br>north of Kailasa in the mountains of Mainaka, there is a huge peak of<br>gems and jewels called Hiranya-sringa. Near that peak is a delightful<br>lake of the name of Vindu. There, on its banks, previously dwelt king<br>Bhagiratha for many years, desiring to behold the goddess Ganga, since<br>called Bhagirathee after that king's name. And there, on its banks, O<br>thou best of the Bharatas, Indra the illustrious lord of every created<br>thing, performed one hundred great sacrifices. There, for the sake of<br>beauty, though not according to the dictates of the ordinance, were<br>placed sacrificial stakes made of gems and altars of gold. There, after<br>performing those sacrifices, the thousand-eyed lord of Sachi became<br>crowned with success. There the fierce Mahadeva, the eternal lord of<br>every creature, has taken up his abode after having created all the<br>worlds and there he dwelleth, worshipped with reverence by thousands of<br>spirits. There Nara and Narayana, Brahma and Yama and Sthanu the fifth,<br>perform their sacrifices at the expiration of a thousand yugas. There,<br>for the establishment of virtue and religion, Vasudeva, with pious<br>devotion, performed his sacrifices extending for many, many long years.<br>There were placed by Keshava thousands and tens of thousands of<br>sacrificial stakes adorned with golden garlands and altars of great<br>splendour. Going thither, O Bharata, Maya brought back the club and the<br>conch-shell and the various crystalline articles that had belonged to<br>king Vrishaparva. And the great Asura, Maya, having gone thither,<br>possessed himself of the whole of the great wealth which was guarded by<br>Yakshas and Rakshasas. Bringing them, the Asura constructed therewith a<br>peerless palace, which was of great beauty and of celestial make,<br>composed entirely of gems and precious stones, and celebrated throughout<br>the three worlds. He gave unto Bhimasena that best of clubs, and unto<br>Arjuna the most excellent conch-shell at whose sound all creatures<br>trembled in awe. And the palace that Maya built consisted of columns of<br>gold, and occupied, O monarch, an area of five thousand cubits. The<br>palace, possessing an exceedingly beautiful form, like unto that of Agni<br>or Suryya, or Soma, shone in great splendour, and by its brilliance<br>seemed to darken even the bright rays of the sun. And with the effulgence<br>it exhibited, which was a mixture of both celestial and terrestrial<br>light, it looked as if it was on fire. Like unto a mass of new clouds<br>conspicuous in the sky, the palace rose up coming into view of all.<br>Indeed, the palace that the dexterous Maya built was so wide, delightful,<br>and refreshing, and composed of such excellent materials, and furnished<br>with such golden walls and archways, and adorned with so many varied<br>pictures, and was withal so rich and well-built, that in beauty it far<br>surpassed Sudharma of the Dasarha race, or the mansion of Brahma himself.<br>And eight thousand Rakshasas called Kinkaras, fierce, huge-bodied and<br>endued with great strength, of red coppery eyes and arrowy ears,<br>well-armed and capable of ranging through the air, used to guard and<br>protect that palace. Within that palace Maya placed a peerless tank, and<br>in that tank were lotuses with leaves of dark-coloured gems and stalks of<br>bright jewels, and other flowers also of golden leaves. And aquatic fowls<br>of various species sported on its bosom. Itself variegated with<br>full-blown lotuses and stocked with fishes and tortoises of golden hue,<br>its bottom was without mud and its water transparent. There was a flight<br>of crystal stairs leading from the banks to the edge of the water. The<br>gentle breezes that swept along its bosom softly shook the flowers that<br>studded it. The banks of that tank were overlaid with slabs of costly<br>marble set with pearls. And beholding that tank thus adorned all around<br>with jewels and precious stones, many kings that came there mistook it<br>for land and fell into it with eyes open. Many tall trees of various<br>kinds were planted all around the palace. Of green foliage and cool<br>shade, and ever blossoming, they were all very charming to behold.<br>Artificial woods were laid around, always emitting a delicious fragrance.<br>And there were many tanks also that were adorned with swans and<br>Karandavas and Chakravakas (Brahminy ducks) in the grounds lying about<br>the mansion. And the breeze bearing the fragrance of lotuses growing in<br>water and (of those growing on land) ministered unto the pleasure and<br>happiness of the Pandavas. And Maya having constructed such a palatial<br>hall within fourteen months, reported its completion unto Yudhishthira."
