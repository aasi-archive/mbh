                            Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"As soon as Vidura endued with great foresight came<br>unto him king Dhritarashtra, the son of Amvika, timidly asked his<br>brother,&#8212;'How doth Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma, proceed along? And<br>how Arjuna? And how the twin sons of Madri? And how, O Kshatta, doth<br>Dhaumya proceed along? And how the illustrious Draupadi? I desire to hear<br>everything, O Kshatta; describe to me all their acts.'<br><br>Vidura replied,&#8212;'Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, hath gone away covering<br>his face with his cloth. And Bhima, O king, hath gone away looking at his<br>own mighty arms. And Jishnu (Arjuna) hath gone away, following the king<br>spreading sand-grains around. And Sahadeva, the son of Madri, hath gone<br>away besmearing his face, and Nakula, the handsomest of men, O king, hath<br>gone away, staining himself with dust and his heart in great affliction.<br>And the large-eyed and beautiful Krishna hath gone away, covering her<br>face with her dishevelled hair following in the wake of the king, weeping<br>and in tears. And O monarch, Dhaumya goeth along the road, with kusa<br>grass in hand, and uttering the aweful mantras of Sama Veda that relate<br>to Yama.'<br><br>Dhritarashtra asked,&#8212;"Tell me, O Vidura, why is it that the Pandavas are<br>leaving Hastinapore in such varied guise."<br><br>"Vidura replied,&#8212;'Though persecuted by thy sons and robbed of his<br>kingdom and wealth the mind of the wise king Yudhishthira the just hath<br>not yet deviated from the path of virtue. King Yudhishthira is always<br>kind, O Bharata, to thy children. Though deprived (of his kingdom and<br>possessions) by foul means, filled with wrath as he is, he doth not open<br>eyes. 'I should not burn the people by looking at them with angry<br>eyes,'&#8212;thinking so, the royal son of Pandu goeth covering his face.<br>Listen to me as I tell thee, O bull of the Bharata race, why Bhima goeth<br>so. 'There is none equal to me in strength of arms,' thinking so Bhima<br>goeth repeatedly stretching forth his mighty arms. And, O king, proud of<br>the strength of his arms, Vrikodara goeth, exhibiting them and desiring<br>to do unto his enemies deeds worthy of those arms. And Arjuna the son of<br>Kunti, capable of using both his arms (in wielding the Gandiva) followeth<br>the footsteps of Yudhishthira, scattering sand-grains emblematical of the<br>arrows he would shower in battle. O Bharata, he indicateth that as the<br>sand-grains are scattered by him with ease, so will he rain arrows with<br>perfect ease on the foe (in time of battle). And Sahadeva goeth<br>besmearing his lace, thinking 'None may recognise me in this day of<br>trouble.' And, O exalted one, Nakula goeth staining himself with dust<br>thinking, 'Lest otherwise I steal the hearts of the ladies that may look<br>at me.' And Draupadi goeth, attired in one piece of stained cloth, her<br>hair dishevelled, and weeping, signifying&#8212;'The wives of those for whom I<br>have been reduced to such a plight, shall on the fourteenth year hence be<br>deprived of husbands, sons and relatives and dear ones and smeared all<br>over with blood, with hair dishevelled and all in their feminine seasons<br>enter Hastinapore having offered oblations of water (unto the manes of<br>those they will have lost). And O Bharata, the learned Dhaumya with<br>passions under full control, holding the kusa grass in his hand and<br>pointing the same towards the south-west, walketh before, singing the<br>mantras of the Sama Veda that relate to Yama. And, O monarch, that<br>learned Brahamana goeth, also signifying, 'When the Bharatas shall be<br>slain in battle, the priests of the Kurus will thus sing the Soma mantras<br>(for the benefit of the deceased).' And the citizens, afflicted with<br>great grief, are repeatedly crying out, 'Alas, alas, behold our masters<br>are going away! O fie on the Kuru elders that have acted like foolish<br>children in thus banishing heirs of Pandu from covetousness alone. Alas,<br>separated from the son of Pandu we all shall become masterless. What love<br>can we bear to the wicked and avaricious Kurus? Thus O king, have the<br>sons of Kunti, endued with great energy of mind, gone away,&#8212;indicating,<br>by manner and signs, the resolutions that are in their hearts. And as<br>those foremost of men had gone away from Hastinapore, flashes of<br>lightning appeared in the sky though without clouds and the earth itself<br>began to tremble. And Rahu came to devour the Sun, although it was not<br>the day of conjunction And meteors began to fall, keeping the city to<br>their right. And jackals and vultures and ravens and other carnivorous<br>beasts and birds began to shriek and cry aloud from the temples of the<br>gods and the tops of sacred trees and walls and house-tops. And these<br>extraordinary calamitous portents, O king, were seen and heard,<br>indicating the destruction of the Bharatas as the consequence of thy evil<br>counsels."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"And, O monarch, while king Dhritarashtra and<br>the wise Vidura were thus talking with each other, there appeared in that<br>assembly of the Kauravas and before the eyes of all, the best of the<br>celestial Rishis. And appealing before them all, he uttered these<br>terrible words, On the fourteenth year hence, the Kauravas, in<br>consequence of Duryodhana's fault, will all be destroyed by the might of<br>Bhima and Arjuna'. And having said this, that best of celestial Rishis,<br>adorned with surpassing Vedic grace, passing through the skies,<br>disappeared from the scene. Then Duryodhana and Karna and Sakuni, the son<br>of Suvala regarding Drona as their sole refuge, offered the kingdom to<br>him. Drona then, addressing the envious and wrathful Duryodhana and<br>Dussasana and Karna and all the Bharata, said, 'The Brahamanas have said<br>that the Pandavas being of celestial origin are incapable of being slain.<br>The sons of Dhritarashtra, however, having, with all the kings, heartily<br>and with reverence sought my protection, I shall look after them to the<br>best of my power. Destiny is supreme, I cannot abandon them. The sons of<br>Pandu, defeated at dice, are going into exile in pursuance of their<br>promise. They will live in the woods for twelve years. Practising the<br>Brahmacharyya mode of life for this period, they will return in anger and<br>to our great grief take the amplest vengeance on their foes. I had<br>formerly deprived Drupada of his kingdom in a friendly dispute. Robbed of<br>his kingdom by me, O Bharata, the king performed a sacrifice for<br>obtaining a son (that should slay me). Aided by the ascetic power of Yaja<br>and Upayaja, Drupada obtained from the (sacrificial) fire a son named<br>Dhrishtadyumna and a daughter, viz., the faultless Krishna, both risen<br>from the sacrificial platform. That Dhrishtadyumna is the brother-in-law<br>of the sons of Pandu by marriage, and dear unto them. It is for him,<br>therefore that I have much fear. Of celestial origin and resplendent as<br>the fire, he was born with bow, arrows, and encased in mail. I am a being<br>that is mortal. Therefore it is for him that I have great fear. That<br>slayer of all foes, the son of Parshatta, hath taken the side of the<br>Pandavas. I shall have to lose my life, if he and I ever encounter each<br>other in battle. What grief can be greater to me in this world than this,<br>ye Kauravas that Dhrishtadyumna is the destined slayer of Drona&#8212;this<br>belief is general. That he hath been born for slaying me hath been heard<br>by me and is widely known also in the world. For thy sake, O Duryodhana,<br>that terrible season of destruction is almost come. Do without loss of<br>time, what may be beneficial unto thee. Think not that everything hath<br>been accomplished by sending the Pandavas into exile. This thy happiness<br>will last for but a moment, even as in winter the shadow of the top of<br>the palm tree resteth (for a short time) at its base. Perform various<br>kinds of sacrifices, and enjoy, and give O Bharata, everything thou<br>likest. On the fourteenth year hence, a great calamity will overwhelm<br>thee.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Hearing these words of Drona, Dhritarashtra<br>said,&#8212;'O Kshatta, the preceptor hath uttered what is true. Go thou and<br>bring back the Pandavas. If they do not come back, let them go treated<br>with respect and affection. Let those my sons go with weapons, and cars,<br>and infantry, and enjoying every other good thing.'"
