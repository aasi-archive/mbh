                            "Bhima said, &#8212;'O Yudhishthira, gamblers have in their houses many women <br>of loose character. They do not yet stake those women having kindness for <br>them even. Whatever wealth and other excellent articles the king of Kasi <br>gave, whatever, gems, animals, wealth, coats of mail and weapons that <br>other kings of the earth gave, our kingdom, thyself and ourselves, have <br>all been won by the foes. At all this my wrath was not excited for thou <br>art our lord. This, however, I regard as a highly improper act&#8212;this <br>act of staking Draupadi. This innocent girl deserveth not this treatment. <br>Having obtained the Pandavas as her lords, it is for thee alone that she <br>is being thus persecuted by the low, despicable, cruel, and mean-minded <br>Kauravas. It is for her sake, O king, that my anger falleth on thee. <br>I shall burn those hands of thine. Sahadeva, bring some fire."<br><br>'Arjuna hearing this, said,&#8212;'Thou hast never, O Bhimasena, before this <br>uttered such words as these. Assuredly thy high morality hath been destroyed <br>by these cruel foes. Thou shouldst not fulfil the wishes of the enemy. <br>Practise thou the highest morality. Whom doth it behave to transgress his <br>virtuous eldest brother? The king was summoned by the foe, and remembering <br>the usage of the Kshatriyas, he played at dice against his will. That <br>is certainly conducive to our great fame.<br><br>'Bhima said,&#8212;'If I had not known, O Dhananjaya, that the king had acted <br>according to Kshatriya usage, then I would have, taking his hands <br>together by sheer force, burnt them in a blazing fire."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Beholding the Pandavas thus distressed <br>and the princess of Panchala also thus afflicted, Vikarna the <br>son of Dhritarashtra said&#8212;'Ye kings, answer ye the question <br>that hath been asked by Yajnaseni. If we do not judge a matter <br>referred to us, all of us will assuredly have to go to hell without <br>delay. How is that Bhishma and Dhritarashtra, both of whom are the <br>oldest of the Kurus, as also the high-souled Vidura, do not say anything! <br>The son of Bharadwaja who is the preceptor of us, as also Kripa, <br>is here. Why do not these best of regenerate ones answer the question? <br>Let also those other kings assembled here from all directions answer <br>according to their judgment this question, leaving aside all motives <br>of gain and anger. Ye kings, answer ye the question that hath been <br>asked by this blessed daughter of king Drupada, and declare after <br>reflection on which side each of ye is.' Thus did Vikarna repeatedly <br>appeal to those that were in that assembly. But those kings answered <br>him not one word, good or ill. And Vikarna having repeatedly appealed <br>to all the kings began to rub his hands and sigh like a snake. And at <br>last the prince said&#8212;'Ye kings of the earth, ye Kauravas, whether <br>ye answer this question or not, I will say what I regard as just and <br>proper. Ye foremost of men, it hath been said that hunting, drinking, <br>gambling, and too much enjoyment of women, are the four vices of kings. <br>The man, that is addicted to these, liveth forsaking virtue. And people <br>do not regard the acts done by a person who is thus improperly engaged, <br>as of any authority. This son of Pandu, while deeply engaged in one of <br>these vicious acts, urged thereto by deceitful gamblers, made Draupadi <br>a stake. The innocent Draupadi is, besides, the common wife of all the <br>sons of Pandu. And the king, having first lost himself offered her as a <br>stake. And Suvala himself desirous of a stake, indeed prevailed upon the <br>king to stake this Krishna. Reflecting upon all these circumstances, I <br>regard Draupadi as not won."<br><br>"Hearing these words, a loud uproar rose from among those present in that <br>assembly. And they all applauded Vikarna and censured the son of Suvala. <br>And at that sound, the son of Radha, deprived of his senses by anger, <br>waving his well-shaped arms, said these words,&#8212;'O Vikarna, many opposite <br>and inconsistent conditions are noticeable in this assembly. Like fire produced <br>from a faggot, consuming the faggot itself, this thy ire will consume thee. <br>These personages here, though urged by Krishna, have not uttered a word. They <br>all regard the daughter of Drupada to have been properly won. Thou alone, O <br>son of Dhritarashtra in consequence of thy immature years, art bursting with <br>wrath, for though but a boy thou speakest in the assembly as if thou wert old. <br>O younger brother of Duryodhana, thou dost not know what morality truly is, <br>for thou sayest like a fool that this Krishna who hath been (justly) won as <br>not won at all. O son of Dhritarashtra, how dost thou regard Krishna as not won,<br>when the eldest of the Pandavas before this assembly staked all his possessions? <br>O bull of the Bharata race, Draupadi is included in all the possessions (of Yudhishthira). <br>Therefore, why regardest thou Krishna who hath been justly won as not won? Draupadi <br>had been mentioned (by Suvala) and approved of as a stake by the Pandavas. <br>For what reason then dost thou yet regard her as not won? Or, if thou <br>thinkest that bringing her hither attired in a single piece of cloth, <br>is an action of impropriety, listen to certain excellent reasons I will <br>give. O son of the Kuru race, the gods have ordained only one husband for <br>one woman. This Draupadi, however, hath many husbands. Therefore, certain <br>it is that she is an unchaste woman. To bring her, therefore, into this <br>assembly attired though she be in one piece of cloth&#8212;even to uncover her <br>is not at all an act that may cause surprise. Whatever wealth the Pandavas <br>had&#8212;she herself and these Pandavas themselves,&#8212;have all been justly won <br>by the son of Suvala. O Dussasana, this Vikarna speaking words of (apparent) <br>wisdom is but a boy. Take off the robes of the Pandavas as also the attire of <br>Draupadi. Hearing these words the Pandavas, O Bharata, took of their upper <br>garments and throwing them down sat in that assembly. Then Dussasana, O king, <br>forcibly seizing Draupadi's attire before the eyes of all, began to drag it off her person."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"When the attire of Draupadi was being thus dragged, <br>the thought of Hari, (And she herself cried aloud, saying), 'O Govinda, <br>O thou who dwellest in Dwaraka, O Krishna, O thou who art fond of cow-herdesses <br>(of Vrindavana). O Kesava, seest thou not that the Kauravas are humiliating me. <br>O Lord, O husband of Lakshmi, O Lord of Vraja (Vrindavana), O destroyer of <br>all afflictions, O Janarddana, rescue me who am sinking in the Kaurava Ocean. <br>O Krishna, O Krishna, O thou great yogin, thou soul of the universe, Thou <br>creator of all things, O Govinda, save me who am distressed,&#8212;who am losing my <br>senses in the midst of the Kurus.' Thus did that afflicted lady resplendent <br>still in her beauty, O king covering her face cried aloud, thinking of <br>Krishna, of Hari, of the lord of the three worlds. Hearing the words of <br>Draupadi, Krishna was deeply moved. And leaving his seat, the benevolent one <br>from compassion, arrived there on foot. And while Yajnaseni was crying aloud <br>to Krishna, also called Vishnu and Hari and Nara for protection, the illustrious <br>Dharma, remaining unseen, covered her with excellent clothes of many hues. And, <br>O monarch as the attire of Draupadi was being dragged, after one was taken off, <br>another of the same kind, appeared covering her. And thus did it continue till <br>many clothes were seen. And, O exalted on, owing to the protection of Dharma, <br>hundreds upon hundreds of robes of many hues came off Draupadi's person. And there <br>arose then a deep uproar of many many voices. And the kings present in that assembly <br>beholding that most extraordinary of all sights in the world, began to applaud <br>Draupadi and censure the son of Dhritarashtra. And Bhima then, squeezing his <br>hands, with lips quivering in rage, swore in the midst of all those kings a terrible <br>oath in a loud voice.<br><br>"And Bhima said,&#8212;Hear these words of mine, ye Kshatriyas of the world. Words such <br>as these were never before uttered by other men, nor will anybody in the future <br>ever utter them. Ye lords of earth, if having spoken these words I do not accomplish them <br>hereafter, let me not obtain the region of my deceased ancestors. Tearing open in <br>battle, by sheer force, the breast of this wretch, this wicked-minded scoundrel <br>of the Bharata race, if I do not drink his life-blood, let me not obtain the region <br>of my ancestors."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Hearing these terrible words of Bhima that made the down of <br>the auditors to stand on end, everybody present there applauded him and censured <br>the son of Dhritarashtra. And when a mass of clothes had been gathered in that <br>assembly, all dragged from the person of Draupadi, Dussasana, tired and ashamed, <br>sat down. And beholding the sons of Kunti in that state, the persons&#8212;those gods <br>among men&#8212;that were in that assembly all uttered the word 'Fie!' (on the son of Dhritarashtra). <br>And the united voices of all became so loud that they made the down of anybody who heard them <br>stand on end. And all the honest men that were in that assembly began to say,&#8212;'Alas! <br>the Kauravas answer not the question that hath been put to them by Draupadi. And all <br>censuring Dhritarashtra together, made a loud clamour. Then Vidura, that master of the <br>science of morality, waving his hands and silencing every one, spake these words;&#8212;<br>'Ye that are in this assembly, Draupadi having put her question is weeping helplessly. <br>Ye are not answering her. Virtue and morality are being persecuted by such conduct. <br>An afflicted person approacheth an assembly of good men, like one that is being consumed by fire. <br>They that are in the assembly quench that fire and cool him by means of truth and <br>morality. The afflicted person asketh the assembly about his rights, as <br>sanctioned by morality. They that are in the assembly should, unmoved by <br>interest and anger, answer the question. Ye kings, Vikarna hath answered <br>the question, according to his own knowledge and judgment. Ye should also <br>answer it as ye think proper. Knowing the rules of morality, and having <br>attended an assembly, he that doth not answer a query that is put, <br>incurreth half the demerit that attacheth to a lie. He, on the other hand, <br>who, knowing the rules of morality and having joined an assembly answereth <br>falsely, assuredly incurreth the sin of a lie. The learned quote as an example <br>in this connection the old history of Prahlada and the son of Angirasa.<br><br>"There was of old a chief of the Daityas of the name Prahlada. He had a son <br>named Virochana. And Virochana, for the sake of obtaining a bride, quarrelled <br>with Sudhanwan, the son of Angiras. It hath been heard by us that they mutually <br>wagered their lives, saying&#8212;I am superior,&#8212;I am superior,&#8212;for the sake of <br>obtaining a bride. And after they had thus quarrelled with each other, they <br>both made Prahlada the arbitrator to decide between them. And they asked him, <br>saying;&#8212;Who amongst us is superior (to the other)? Answer this question. <br>Speak not falsely. Frightened at this quarrel, Prahlada cast his eyes upon <br>Sudhanwan. And Sudhanwan in rage, burning like unto the mace of Yama, told <br>him,&#8212;If thou answerest falsely, or dost not answer at all thy head will <br>then be split into a hundred pieces by the wielder of the thunderbolt with <br>that bolt of his.&#8212;Thus addressed by Sudhanwan, the Daitya, trembling like a <br>leaf of the fig tree, went to Kasyapa of great energy, for taking counsel with <br>him. And Prahlada said,&#8212;'Thou art, O illustrious and exalted one, fully <br>conversant with the rules of morality that should guide both the gods and <br>the Asuras and the Brahmanas as well. Here, however, is a situation of great <br>difficulty in respect of duty. Tell me, I ask thee, what regions are obtainable <br>by them who upon being asked a question, answer it not, or answer it falsely. <br>Kasyapa thus asked answered.&#8212;'He that knoweth, but answereth not a question <br>from temptation, anger or fear, casteth upon himself a thousand nooses of <br>Varuna. And the person who, cited as a witness with respect to any matter <br>of ocular or auricular knowledge, speaketh carelessly, casteth a thousand <br>nooses of Varuna upon his own person. On the completion of one full year, <br>one such noose is loosened. Therefore, he that knoweth, should speak the <br>truth without concealment. If virtue, pierced by sin, repaireth to an <br>assembly (for aid), it is the duty of every body in the assembly to take <br>off the dart, otherwise they themselves would be pierced with it. In an <br>assembly where a truly censurable act is not rebuked, half the demerit <br>of that act attacheth to the head of that assembly, a fourth to the <br>person acting censurably and a fourth unto those others that are there. <br>In that assembly, on the other hand, when he that deserveth censure is <br>rebuked, the head of the assembly becometh freed from all sins, and the <br>other members also incur none. It is only the perpetrator himself of the <br>act that becometh responsible for it. O Prahlada, they who answer falsely <br>those that ask them about morality destroy the meritorious acts of their <br>seven upper and seven lower generations. The grief of one who hath lost all <br>his wealth, of one who hath lost a son, of one who is in debt, of one who <br>is separated from his companions, of a woman who hath lost her husband, of <br>one that hath lost his all in consequence of the king's demand, of a woman <br>who is sterile, of one who hath been devoured by a tiger (during his last <br>struggles in the tiger's claws), of one who is a co-wife, and of one who <br>hath been deprived of his property by false witnesses, have been said by the<br>gods to be uniform in degree. These different sorts of grief are his who speaketh <br>false. A person becometh a witness in consequence of his having seen, heard, <br>and understood a thing. Therefore, a witness should always tell the truth. <br>A truth-telling witness never loseth his religious merits and earthly possessions <br>also.' Hearing these words of Kasyapa, Prahlada told his son, "Sudhanwan is superior <br>to thee, as indeed, (his father) Angiras is superior to me. The mother also of Sudhanwan <br>is superior to thy mother. Therefore, O Virochana, this Sudhanwan is now the lord of the <br>life." At these words of Prahlada, Sudhanwan said, "Since unmoved by affection for thy <br>child, thou hast adhered to virtue, I command, let this son of thine live for a hundred <br>years."<br><br>"Vidura continued,&#8212;Let all the persons, therefore, present in this assembly hearing <br>these high truths of morality, reflect upon what should be the answer to the question <br>asked by Draupadi".<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"The kings that were there hearing these words of Vidura, <br>answered not a word, yet Karna alone spoke unto Dussasana, telling him. Take away <br>this serving-woman Krishna into the inner apartments. And thereupon Dussasana began <br>to drag before all the spectators the helpless and modest Draupadi, trembling and <br>crying piteously unto the Pandavas her lords."
