                            "Yudhishthira said,&#8212;'Desirous of the imperial dignity but acting from<br>selfish motives and relying upon courage alone, how, O Krishna, can I<br>despatch ye (unto Jarasandha)? Both Bhima and Arjuna, I regard as my<br>eyes, and thee, O Janardana as my mind. How shall I live, deprived of my<br>eyes and mind. Yama himself cannot vanquish in battle the mighty host of<br>Jarasandha that is endued, besides, with terrible valour. What valour can<br>ye exhibit against it. This affair that promises to terminate otherwise<br>may lead to great mischief. It is my opinion, therefore, that the<br>proposed task should not be undertaken. Listen, O Krishna, to what I for<br>one think. O Janardana, desisting from this act seemeth to me to be<br>beneficial. My heart to-day is afflicted. The Rajasuya appeareth to me<br>difficult of accomplishment.'"<br><br>"Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Arjuna who had obtained that excellent of bows and<br>that couple of inexhaustible quivers, and that car with that banner, as<br>also that assembly room, now addressed Yudhishthira and said,&#8212;'I have<br>obtained, O king, a bow and weapons and arrows and energy and allies and<br>dominions and fame and strength. Those are always difficult of<br>acquisition, however much they may be desired. Learned men of repute<br>always praise in good society nobleness of descent. But nothing is equal<br>to might. Indeed, O monarch, there is nothing I like more than prowess.<br>Born in a race noted for its valour, one that is without valour is<br>scarcely worthy of regard. One, however, possessed of valour, that is<br>born in a race not noted for it, is much superior to the former. He, O<br>king, is a Kshatriya in every thing who increaseth his fame and<br>possessions by the subjugation of his enemies. And he that is possessed<br>of valour, though destitute of all (other) merits, will vanquish his<br>foes. One, however, that is destitute of valour, though possessed of<br>every (other) merit, can scarcely accomplish anything. Every merit exists<br>by the side of valour in an incipient state. Concentration of attention,<br>exertion and destiny exist as the three causes of victory. One, however,<br>that is possessed of valour doth not yet deserve success if he acts<br>carelessly. It is for this that an enemy endued with strength sometimes<br>suffers death at the hands of his foes. As meanness overtakes the weak,<br>so folly sometimes overtakes the strong. A king, therefore, that is<br>desirous of victory, should avoid both these causes of destruction. If,<br>for the purpose of our sacrifice, we endeavour to slay Jarasandha and<br>rescue the kings kept by him for a cruel purpose, there is no higher act<br>which we could employ ourselves in. If, however, we do not undertake the<br>task, the world will always think us incompetent. We have certainly the<br>competence, O king! Why should you, therefore, regard us as incompetent?<br>Those that have become Munis desirous of achieving tranquillity of souls,<br>obtain yellow robes with ease. So if we vanquish the foe, the imperial<br>dignity will easily be ours. We shall, therefore fight the foe."
