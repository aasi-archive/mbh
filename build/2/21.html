                            "Vasudeva said,&#8212;'behold, O Partha, the great capital of Magadha,<br>standing in all its beauty. Filled with flocks and herds and its stock of<br>water never exhausted, and adorned also with fine mansions standing in<br>excellent array, it is free from every kind of calamity. The five large<br>hills of Vaihara, Varaha, Vrishava, Rishigiri, and the delightful<br>Chaitya, all of high peaks and overgrown with tall trees of cool shade<br>and connected with one another, seem to be jointly protecting the city of<br>Girivraja. The breasts of the hills are concealed by forests of<br>delightful and fragrant Lodhras having the ends of their branches covered<br>with flowers. It was here that the illustrious Gautama of rigid vows<br>begat on the Sudra woman Ausinari (the daughter of Usinara) Kakshivat and<br>other celebrated sons. That the race sprung from Gautama doth yet live<br>under the sway of an ordinary human race (of monarchs) is only evidence<br>of Gautama's kindness to kings. And, O Arjuna, it was here that in olden<br>times the mighty monarchs of Anga, and Vanga and other countries, came to<br>the abode of Gautama, and passed their days in joy and happiness. Behold,<br>O Partha, those forests of delightful Pippalas and beautiful Lodhras<br>standing near the side of Gautama's abode. There dwelt in old days those<br>Nagas, Arvuda and Sakravapin, those persecutors of all enemies, as also<br>the Naga Swastika and that other excellent Naga called Manu. Manu himself<br>had ordered the country of the Magadhas to be never afflicted with<br>drought, and Kaushika and Manimat also have favoured the country. Owning<br>such a delightful and impregnable city, Jarasandha is ever bent on<br>seeking the fruition of his purposes unlike other monarchs. We shall,<br>however, by slaying him to-day humble his pride."<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;Thus saying those brothers of abundant energy, viz.,<br>he of the Vrishni race and the two Pandavas entered the city of Magadha.<br>They then approached towards the impregnable city of Girivraja that was<br>full of cheerful and well-fed inhabitants belonging to all the four<br>orders, and where festivities were perennial. On arriving then at the<br>gate of the city, the brothers (instead of passing through it) began to<br>pierce (with their shafts) the heart of the high Chaityaka peak that was<br>worshipped by the race of Vrihadratha, as also by the citizens and which<br>delighted the hearts of all the Magadhas. There Vrihadratha had slain a<br>cannibal called Rishava and having slain the monster made of his hide<br>three drums which he placed in his own city. And those drums were such<br>that once beaten their sound lasted one full month. And the brothers<br>broke down the Chaityaka peak that was delightful to all the Magadhas, at<br>that point where those drums covered with celestial flowers used to yield<br>their continuous sound. And desirous of slaying Jarasandha they seemed by<br>that act of theirs to place their feet upon the head of their foe. And<br>attacking with their mighty arms that immovable and huge and high and old<br>and celebrated peak always worshipped with perfumes and floral wreaths,<br>those heroes broke it down. And with joyful hearts they then entered the<br>city. And it so happened that the learned Brahmanas residing within the<br>city saw many evil omens which they reported to Jarasandha. And the<br>priest making the king mount an elephant whirled lighted brands about<br>him. And king Jarasandha also, possessed of great prowess, with a view to<br>warding of those evils, entered upon the celebration of a sacrifice, with<br>proper vows and fasts. Meanwhile, O Bharata, the brothers unarmed, or<br>rather with their bare arms as their only weapons, desirous of fighting<br>with Jarasandha, entered the capital in the guise of Brahmanas. They<br>beheld the extraordinary beauty of the shops full of various edibles and<br>floral wreaths, and supplied with articles of every variety of various<br>qualities that man can desire. Those best of men, Krishna, Bhima, and<br>Dhananjaya, beholding in those shops their affluence, passed along the<br>public road. And endued with great strength they snatched forcibly from<br>the flower-vendors the garlands they had exposed for sale. And attired in<br>robes of various colours and decked in garlands and ear-rings the heroes<br>entered the abode of Jarasandha possessed of great intelligence, like<br>Himalayan lions eyeing cattle-folds. And the arms of those warriors, O<br>king, besmeared with sandal paste, looked like the trunks of sala trees.<br>The people of Magadha, beholding those heroes looking like elephants,<br>with necks broad like those of trees and wide chests, began to wonder<br>much. Those bull among men, passing through three gates that were crowded<br>with men, proudly and cheerfully approached the king. And Jarasandha<br>rising up in haste received them with water to wash their feet with, and<br>honey and the other ingredients of the Arghya&#8212;with gifts of kine, and<br>with other forms of respect. The great king addressing them said,&#8212;'Ye<br>are welcome'! And, O Janamejaya, both Partha and Bhima remained silent at<br>this. And addressing the monarch Krishna said,&#8212;'O king of kings these<br>two are now in the observance of a vow. Therefore they will not speak.<br>Silent they will remain till midnight After that hour they will speak<br>with thee!' The king then quartering his guests in the sacrificial<br>apartments retired into his private chambers. And when midnight arrived,<br>the monarch arrived at the place where his guests attired as Brahmanas<br>were. For, O King, that ever victorious monarch observed this vow which<br>was known throughout the Worlds that as soon as he should hear of the<br>arrival of Snataka Brahmanas at his place, should it be even at midnight,<br>he would immediately, O Bharata, come out and grant them an audience.<br>Beholding the strange attire of his guests that best of kings wondered<br>much. For all that, however, he waited on them respectfully. Those bulls<br>among men, those slayers of all foes, on the other hand, O thou best of<br>the Bharata race, beholding king Jarasandha, said,&#8212;'Let salvation be<br>attained by thee, O king, without difficulty.' And, O tiger among kings,<br>having said this unto the monarch, they stood looking at each other. And,<br>O king of kings, Jarasandha then said unto those sons of Pandu and him of<br>the Yadu race, all disguised as Brahmanas&#8212;'Take your seats.' And those<br>bulls among men sat themselves down, and like the three priests of a<br>great sacrifice blazed forth in their beauty. And king Jarasandha, O thou<br>of the Kuru race, firmly devoted to truth, censuring the disguised<br>guests, said unto them,&#8212;'It is well known to me that in the whole world<br>Brahmanas in the observance of Snataka vow never deck their persons with<br>garlands and fragrant paste unseasonably. Who are ye, therefore, thus<br>decked with flowers, and with hands bearing the marks of the bow-string?<br>Attired in coloured robes and decked unseasonably with flowers and paste,<br>ye give me to understand that ye are Brahmanas, although ye bear<br>Kshatriya energy. Tell me truly who ye are. Truth decks even kings.<br>Breaking down the peak of the Chaityaka hill, why have ye, in disguise,<br>entered (the city) by an improper gate without fear of the royal wrath?<br>The energy of a Brahmana dwelleth in his speech, (not in act). This your<br>feat is not suited to the order to which ye profess to belong. Tell us<br>therefore, the end ye have in view. Arrived here by such an improper way,<br>why accept ye not the worship I offer? What is your motive for coming to<br>me? Thus addressed by the king, the high-souled Krishna, well-skilled in<br>speech, thus replied unto the monarch in a calm and grave voice.<br><br>"Krishna said,&#8212;'O king, know us for Snataka Brahmanas. Brahmanas and<br>Kshatriyas and Vaishyas are all, O monarch, competent to observe the vow<br>of Snataka. This vow, besides, hath (many) especial and general rules. A<br>Kshatriya observing this vow with especial rules always achieve<br>prosperity. Therefore, have we decked ourselves with flowers. Kshatriyas<br>again, O king, exhibit their energy by their arms and not in speech. It<br>is, therefore, O son of Vrihadratha, that the speeches uttered by a<br>Kshatriya are never audacious. O monarch, the creator hath planted his<br>own energy in the aim of the Kshatriya. If thou wishest to behold it,<br>thou shalt certainly behold it today. These are the rules of the<br>ordinance, viz., that an enemy's abode should be entered through a wrong<br>gate and a friend's abode through the right one. And know, O monarch,<br>that this also is our eternal vow that having entered the foe's abode for<br>the accomplishment of our purpose, we accept not the worship offered to<br>us!"
