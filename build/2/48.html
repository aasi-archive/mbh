                            Vaisampayana said&#8212;"O king, impressed with the great Rajasuya sacrifice<br>of king Yudhishthira, Sakuni, the son of Suvala, having learnt before the<br>intentions of Duryodhana, while accompanying him in the way from the<br>assembly house, and desirous of saying what was agreeable to him,<br>approached Dhritarashtra endued with great wisdom, and finding the<br>monarch deprived of his eye seated (in his throne), told him these<br>words,&#8212;'Know, O great king, O bull of the Bharata race, that Duryodhana,<br>having lost colour, hath become pale and emaciated and depressed and a<br>prey to anxiety. Why dost thou not, after due enquiry, ascertain the<br>grief that is in the heart of thy eldest son, the grief that is caused by<br>the foe?'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;'Duryodhana, what is the reason of thy great<br>affliction. O son of the Kuru race? If it is fit for me to hear it, then<br>tell me the reason. This Sakuni here says that thou hast lost colour,<br>become pale and emaciated, and a prey to anxiety. I do not know what can<br>be the reason of the sorrow. This vast wealth of mine is at thy control.<br>Thy brothers and all our relations never do anything that is disagreeable<br>to thee. Thou wearest the best apparel and eatest the best food that is<br>prepared with meat. The best of horse carries thee. What it is,<br>therefore, that hath made thee pale and emaciated? Costly beds, beautiful<br>damsels, mansions decked with excellent furniture, and sport of the<br>delightful kind, without doubt these all wait but at thy command, as in<br>the case of the gods themselves Therefore, O proud one, why dost thou<br>grieve, O son, as if thou wert destitute.'<br><br>"Duryodhana said,&#8212;'I eat and dress myself like a wretch and pass my time<br>all the while a prey to fierce jealousy. He indeed is a man, who<br>incapable of bearing the pride of the foe, liveth having vanquished that<br>foe with the desire of liberating his own subjects from the tyranny of<br>the foe. Contentment, as also pride, O Bharata, are destructive of<br>prosperity; and those other two qualities also, viz., compassion and<br>fear. One who acteth under the influence of these, never obtaineth<br>anything high. Having beheld Yudhishthira's prosperity, whatever I enjoy<br>brings me no gratification. The prosperity of Kunti's son that is<br>possessed of such splendour maketh me pale. Knowing the affluence of the<br>foe and my own destitution, even though that affluence is not before me,<br>I yet see it before me. Therefore, have I lost colour and become<br>melancholy, pale and emaciated. Yudhishthira supporteth eighty-eight<br>thousand Snataka Brahmanas leading domestic lives, giving unto each of<br>them thirty slave-girls. Beside this, thousand other Brahmanas daily eat<br>at his palace the best of food on golden plates. The king of Kambhoja<br>sent unto him (as tribute) innumerable skins, black, darkish, and red, of<br>the deer Kadali, as also numberless blankets of excellent textures. And<br>hundreds and thousands and thousands of she-elephants and thirty thousand<br>she-camels wander within the palace, for the kings of the earth brought<br>them all as tribute to the capital of the Pandavas. And, O lord of earth,<br>the kings also brought unto this foremost of sacrifices heaps upon heaps<br>of jewels and gems for the son of Kunti. Never before did I see or hear<br>of such enormous wealth as was brought unto the sacrifice of the<br>intelligent sons of Pandu. And, O king, beholding that enormous<br>collection of wealth belonging to the foe, I can not enjoy peace of mind.<br>Hundreds of Brahmanas supported by the grants that Yudhishthira hath<br>given them and possessing wealth of kine, waited at the palace gate with<br>three thousands of millions of tribute but were prevented by the keepers<br>from entering the mansion. Bringing with them clarified butter in<br>handsome Kamandalus made of gold, they did not obtain admission into the<br>palace, and Ocean himself brought unto him in vessels of white copper the<br>nectar that is generated within his waters and which is much superior to<br>that which flowers and annual plants produce for Sakra. And Vasudeva (at<br>the conclusion of the sacrifice) having brought an excellent conch bathed<br>the Sun of Pritha with sea water brought in thousand jars of gold, all<br>well adorned with numerous gems. Beholding all this I became feverish<br>with jealousy. Those jars had been taken to the Eastern and the Southern<br>oceans. And they had also been taken on the shoulders of men to the<br>Western ocean, O bull among men. And, O father, although none but birds<br>only can go to the Northern region Arjuna, having gone thither, exacted<br>as tribute a vast quantity of wealth. There is another wonderful incident<br>also which I will relate to thee. O listen to me. When a hundred thousand<br>Brahmanas were fed, it had been arranged that to notify this act every<br>day conches would be blown in a chorus. But, O Bharata, I continually<br>heard conches blown there almost repeatedly. And hearing those notes my<br>hair stood on end. And, O great king, that palatial compound, filled with<br>innumerable monarchs that came there as spectators, looked exceedingly<br>handsome like the cloudless firmament with stars. And, O king of men, the<br>monarchs came into that sacrifice of the wise son of Pandu bringing with<br>them every kind of wealth. And the kings that came there became like<br>Vaisyas the distributors of food unto the Brahmanas that were fed. And O<br>king, the prosperity that I beheld of Yudhishthira was such that neither<br>the chief himself of the celestials, nor Yama or Varuna, nor the lord of<br>the Guhyakas owneth the same. And beholding that great prosperity of the<br>son of Pandu, my heart burneth and I cannot enjoy peace.<br><br>"Hearing these words of Duryodhana, Sakuni replied,&#8212;'Hear how thou<br>mayest obtain this unrivalled prosperity that thou beholdest in the son<br>of Pandu, O thou that hast truth for thy prowess. O Bharata, I am an<br>adept at dice, superior to all in the world. I can ascertain the success<br>or otherwise of every throw, and when to stake and when not. I have<br>special knowledge of the game. The Son of Kunti also is fond of dice<br>playing though he possesseth little skill in it. Summoned to play or<br>battle, he is sure to come forward, and I will defeat him repeatedly at<br>every throw by practising deception. I promise to win all that wealth of<br>his, and thou, O Duryodhana, shalt then enjoy the same.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"King Duryodhana, thus addressed by Sakuni,<br>without allowing a moment to elapse, said unto Dhritarashtra,&#8212;'This,<br>Sakuni, an adept at dice, is ready to win at dice, O king, the wealth of<br>the sons of Pandu. It behoveth thee to grant him permission to do so.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra replied,&#8212;'I always follow the counsels of Kshatta, my<br>minister possessed of great wisdom. Having consulted with him, I will<br>inform thee what my judgment is in respect of this affair. Endued with<br>great foresight, he will, keeping morality before his eyes, tell us what<br>is good and what is proper for both parties, and what should be done in<br>this matter.'<br><br>"Duryodhana said,&#8212;'If thou consultest with Kshatta he will make thee<br>desist. And if thou desist, O king, I will certainly kill myself. And<br>when I am dead, O king, thou wilt become happy with Vidura. Thou wilt<br>then enjoy the whole earth; what need hast thou with me?'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Dhritarashtra, hearing these words of<br>affliction uttered by Duryodhana from mixed feeling, himself ready to<br>what Duryodhana had dictated, commanded his servant, saying,&#8212;'Let<br>artificers be employed to erect without delay a delightful and handsome<br>and spacious palace with an hundred doors and a thousand columns. And<br>having brought carpenters and joiners, set ye jewels and precious stones<br>all over the walls. And making it handsome and easy of access, report to<br>me when everything is complete. And, O monarch, king Dhritarashtra having<br>made this resolution for the pacification of Duryodhana, sent messengers<br>unto Vidura for summoning him. For without taking counsel with Vidura<br>never did the monarch form any resolution. But as regards the matter at<br>hand, the king although he knew the evils of gambling, was yet attracted<br>towards it. The intelligent Vidura, however, as soon as he heard of it,<br>knew that the arrival of Kali was at hand. And seeing that the way to<br>destruction was about to open, he quickly came to Dhritarashtra. And<br>Vidura approaching his illustrious eldest brother and bowing down unto<br>his feet, said these words:<br><br>'O exalted king, I do not approve of this resolution that thou hast<br>formed. It behave thee, O king, to act in such a way that no dispute may<br>arise between thy children on account of this gambling match.'<br><br>Dhritarashtra replied,&#8212;'O Kshatta, if the gods be merciful unto us,<br>assuredly no dispute will ever arise amongst my sons. Therefore,<br>auspicious or otherwise, beneficial or otherwise, let this friendly<br>challenge at dice proceed. Even this without doubt is what fate hath<br>ordained for us. And, O son of the Bharata race, when I am near, and<br>Drona and Bhishma and thou too, nothing evil that even Fate might have<br>ordained is likely to happen. Therefore, go thou on a car yoking thereto<br>horses endued with the speed of the wind, so that thou mayest reach<br>Khandavaprastha even today and bring thou Yudhishthira with thee. And, O<br>Vidura, I tell that even this is my resolution. Tell me nothing. I regard<br>Fate as supreme which bringeth all this.' Hearing these words of<br>Dhritarashtra and concluding that his race was doomed, Vidura in great<br>sorrow went unto Bhishma with great wisdom."
