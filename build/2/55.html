                            "Sakuni said,&#8212;O thou foremost of victorious persons, I will snatch (for<br>thee) this prosperity of Yudhishthira, the son of Pandu, at the sight of<br>which thou grievest so. Therefore, O king, let Yudhishthira the son of<br>Kunti be summoned. By throwing dice a skilful man, himself uninjured, may<br>vanquish one that hath no skill. Know, O Bharata, that betting is my bow,<br>the dice are my arrows, the marks on them my bow-string, and the<br>dice-board my car.<br><br>"Duryodhana said,&#8212;'This Sukuni skilled at dice, is ready, O king, to<br>snatch the prosperity of the son of Pandu by means of dice. It behoveth<br>thee to give him permission.<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;'I am obedient to the counsels of my brother, the<br>illustrious Vidura. Consulting with him, I shall tell what should be done<br>in this matter.<br><br>"Duryodhana said,&#8212;'Vidura is always engaged in doing good to the sons of<br>Pandu. O Kaurava, his feelings towards us are otherwise. He will,<br>therefore, without doubt, withdraw thy heart from the proposed act. No<br>man should set himself to any task depending upon the counsels of<br>another, for, O son of Kuru's race, the minds of two persons seldom agree<br>in any particular act. The fool that liveth shunning all causes of fear<br>wasteth himself like an insect in the rainy season. Neither sickness nor<br>Yama waiteth till one is in prosperity. So long, therefore, as there is<br>life and health, one should (without waiting for prosperity) accomplish<br>his purpose.'<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;'O son, hostility with those that are strong, is<br>what never recommendeth itself to me. Hostility bringeth about a change<br>of feelings, and that itself is a weapon though not made of steel. Thou<br>regardest, O Prince, as a great blessing what will bring in its train the<br>terrible consequences of war. What is really fraught with mischief. If<br>once it beginneth, it will create sharp swords and pointed arrows.'<br><br>"Duryodhana replied,&#8212;'Men of the most ancient times invented the use of<br>dice. There is no destruction in it, nor is there any striking with,<br>weapons. Let the words of Sakuni, therefore, be acceptable to thee, and<br>let thy command be issued for the speedy construction of the assembly<br>house. The door of heaven, leading us to such happiness, will be opened<br>to us by gambling. Indeed, they that betake to gambling (with such aid)<br>deserve such good fortune. The Pandavas then will become thy equals<br>(instead of, as now, superiors); therefore, gamble thou with the Pandavas.<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said.&#8212;'The words uttered by thee do not recommend<br>themselves to me. Do what may be agreeable to thee, O ruler of men. But<br>thou shall have to repent for acting according to these words; for, words<br>that are fraught with such immorality can never bring prosperity in the<br>future. Even this was foreseen by the learned Vidura ever treading the<br>path of truth and wisdom. Even the great calamity, destructive of the<br>lives of the Kshatriyas, cometh as destined by fate.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued&#8212;"Having said this, the weak-minded Dhritarashtra<br>regarded fate as supreme and unavoidable. And the king deprived of reason<br>by Fate, and obedient to the counsels of his son, commanded his men in<br>loud voice, saying&#8212;'Carefully construct, without loss of time, an<br>assembly house of the most beautiful description, to be called the<br>crystal-arched palace with a thousand columns, decked with gold and lapis<br>lazuli, furnished with a hundred gates, and full two miles in length and<br>in breadth the same.' Hearing those words of his, thousands of artificers<br>endued with intelligence and skill soon erected the palace with the<br>greatest alacrity, and having erected it brought thither every kind of<br>article. And soon after they cheerfully represented unto the king that<br>the palace had been finished, and that it as delightful and handsome and<br>furnished with every kind of gems and covered with many-coloured carpets<br>inlaid with gold. Then king Dhritarashtra, possessed of learning,<br>summoning Vidura the chief of his ministers, said:&#8212;'Repairing, (to<br>Khandavaprastha), bring prince Yudhishthira here without loss of time.<br>Let him come hither with his brothers, and behold his handsome assembly<br>house of mine, furnished with countless jewels and gems, and costly beds<br>and carpets, and let a friendly match at dice commence here.'"
