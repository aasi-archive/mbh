                            Vaisampayana said,&#8212;in the meantime, Bhimasena also endued with great<br>energy, having obtained the assent of Yudhishthira the just marched<br>towards the eastern direction. And the tiger among the Bharatas,<br>possessed of great valour and ever increasing the sorrows of his foes,<br>was accompanied by a mighty host with the full complement of elephants<br>and horses and cars, well-armed and capable of crushing all hostile<br>kingdoms. That tiger among men, the son of Pandu, going first into the<br>great country of the Panchalas, began by various means to conciliate that<br>tribe. Then that hero, that bull of the Bharata race, within a short<br>time, vanquished the Gandakas and the Videhas. That exalted one then<br>subjugated the Dasarnas. There in the country of the Dasarnas, the king<br>called Sudharman with his bare arms fought a fierce battle with<br>Bhimasena. And Bhimasena, beholding that feat of the illustrious king,<br>appointed the mighty Sudharman as the first in command of his forces.<br>Then Bhima of terrible prowess marched towards the east, causing the<br>earth itself to tremble with the tread of the mighty host that followed<br>him. Then that hero who in strength was the foremost of all strong men<br>defeated in battle Rochamana, the king of Aswamedha, at the head of all<br>his troops. And the son of Kunti, having vanquished that monarch by<br>performing feats that excelled in fierceness, subjugated the eastern<br>region. Then that prince of the Kuru race, endued with great prowess<br>going into the country of Pulinda in the south, brought Sukumara and the<br>king Sumitra under his sway. Then, O Janamejaya, that bull in the Bharata<br>race, at the command of Yudhishthira the just marched against Sisupala of<br>great energy. The king of Chedi, hearing of the intentions of the son of<br>Pandu, came out of his city. And that chastiser of all foes then received<br>the son of Pritha with respect. Then, O king, those bulls of the Chedi<br>and the Kuru lines, thus met together, enquired after each other's<br>welfare. Then, O monarch, the king of Chedi offered his kingdom unto<br>Bhima and said smilingly,&#8212;'O sinless one, upon what art thou bent?' And<br>Bhima thereupon represented unto him the intentions of king Yudhishthira.<br>And Bhima dwelt there, O king, for thirty nights, duly entertained by<br>Sisupala. And after this he set out from Chedi with his troops and<br>vehicles."
