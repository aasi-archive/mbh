                            "Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Janardana deserving the worship of all, having<br>lived happily at Khandavaprastha for some time, and having been treated<br>all the while with respectful love and affection by the sons of Pritha,<br>became desirous one day of leaving Khandavaprastha to behold his father.<br>That possessor of large eyes, unto whom was due the obeisance of the<br>universe, then saluted both Yudhishthira and Pritha and made obeisance<br>with his head unto the feet of Kunti, his father's sister. Thus revered<br>by Kesava, Pritha smelt his head and embraced him. The illustrious<br>Hrishikesa approached his own sister Subhadra affectionately, with his<br>eyes filled with tears, and spoke unto her words of excellent import and<br>truth, terse proper, unanswerable and fraught with good. The<br>sweet-speeched Subhadra also, saluting him in return and worshipping him<br>repeatedly with bent head, told him all that she wished to be conveyed to<br>her relatives on the paternal side. And bidding her farewell and uttering<br>benedictions on his handsome sister, he of the Vrishni race, next saw<br>Draupadi and Dhaumya. That best of men duly made obeisance unto Dhaumya,<br>and consoling Draupadi obtained leave from her. Then the learned and<br>mighty Krishna, accompanied by Partha, went to his cousins. And<br>surrounded by the five brothers, Krishna shone like Sakra in the midst of<br>the celestials. He whose banner bore the figure of Garuda, desirous of<br>performing the rites preparatory to the commencement of a journey,<br>purified himself by a bath and adorned his person with ornaments. The<br>bull of the Yadu race then worshipped the gods and Brahmanas with floral<br>wreaths, mantras, bows of the head, and excellent perfumes. Having<br>finished all these rites, that foremost of steady and virtuous persons<br>then thought of setting out. The chief of the Yadu race then came out of<br>the inner to the outer apartment, and issuing thence he made unto<br>Brahmanas, deserving of worship, offerings of vessel-fulls of curd and<br>fruits, and parched-grain and caused them to pronounce benedictions upon<br>him. And making unto them presents also of wealth, he went round them.<br>Then ascending his excellent car of gold endued with great speed and<br>adorned with banner bearing the figure of Tarkhya (Garuda) and furnished<br>also with mace, discus, sword, his bow Sharnga and other weapons, and<br>yoking thereunto his horses Saivya and Sugriva, he of eyes like lotuses<br>set out at an excellent moment of a lunar day of auspicious stellar<br>conjunction. And Yudhishthira, the king of the Kurus, from affection,<br>ascended the chariot after Krishna, and causing that best charioteer<br>Daruka to stand aside, himself took the reins. And Arjuna also, of long<br>arms, riding on that car, walked round Krishna and fanned him with a<br>white chamara furnished with a handle of gold. And the mighty Bhimasena<br>accompanied by the twin brothers Nakula and Sahadeva and the priests and<br>citizens all followed Krishna from behind. And Kesava, that slayer of<br>hostile heroes, followed by all the brothers, shone like a preceptor<br>followed by his favourite pupils. Then Govinda spoke unto Arjuna and<br>clasped him firmly, and worshipping Yudhisthira and Bhima, embraced the<br>twins. And embraced in return by the three elder Pandavas, he was<br>reverentially saluted by the twins. After having gone about half a Yojana<br>(two miles), Krishna, that subjugator of hostile towns, respectfully<br>addressed Yudhishthira and requested him, O Bharata, to stop following<br>him further. And Govinda, conversant with every duty, then reverentially<br>saluted Yudhishthira and took hold of his feet. But Yudhishthira soon<br>raised Kesava and smelt his head. King Yudhishthira the just, the son of<br>Pandu, having raised Krishna endued with eyes like lotus-petals and the<br>foremost of the Yadava race, gave him leave, saying,&#8212;'Good bye!' Then<br>the slayer of Madhu, making an appointment with them (about his return)<br>in words that were proper, and preventing with difficulty the Pandavas<br>from following him further on foot, gladly proceeded towards his own<br>city, like Indra going towards Amravati. Out of the love and affection<br>they bore him, the Pandavas gazed on Krishna as long as he was within<br>sight, and their minds also followed him when he got out of sight. And<br>Kesava of agreeable person soon disappeared from their sight, unsatiated<br>though their minds were with looking at him. Those bulls among men, the<br>sons of Pritha, with minds fixed on Govinda, desisted (from following him<br>further) and unwillingly returned to their own city in haste. And Krishna<br>in his car soon reached Dwaraka followed by that hero Satyaki. Then<br>Sauri, the son of Devaki, accompanied by his charioteer Daruka reached<br>Dwaraka with the speed of Garuda."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"Meanwhile king Yudhishthira of unfading glory,<br>accompanied by his brothers and surrounded by friends, entered his<br>excellent capital. And that tiger among men, dismissing all his<br>relatives, brothers, and sons, sought to make himself happy in the<br>company of Draupadi. And Kesava also, worshipped by the principal Yadavas<br>including Ugrasena, entered with a happy heart his own excellent city.<br>And worshipping his old father and his illustrious mother, and saluting<br>(his brother) Valadeva, he of eyes like lotus-petals took his seat.<br>Embracing Pradyumna, Shamva, Nishatha, Charudeshna, Gada, Aniruddha and<br>Bhanu, and obtaining the leave of all the elderly men, Janardana entered<br>the apartments of Rukmini."
