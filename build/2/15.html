                            "Yudhishthira said,&#8212;"Intelligent as thou art, thou hast said what none<br>else is capable of saying. There is none else on earth who is settler of<br>all doubts. Behold, there are kings in every province employed in<br>benefiting their respective selves. But no one amongst them hath been<br>able to achieve the imperial dignity. Indeed, the title emperor is<br>difficult of acquisition. He that knoweth the valour and strength of<br>others never applaudeth himself. He, indeed, is really worthy of applause<br>(worship) who, engaged in encounters with his enemies, beareth himself<br>commendably. O thou supporter of the dignity of the Vrishni race, man's<br>desires and propensities, like the wide earth itself adorned with many<br>jewels, are varied and extensive. As experience can seldom be gained but<br>by travelling in regions remote from one's home, so salvation can never<br>be attained except by acting according to principles that are very high,<br>compared with the ordinary level of our desire and propensities. I regard<br>peace of mind as the highest object here, for from that quality may<br>proceed my prosperity. In my judgment, if I undertake to celebrate this<br>sacrifice, I shall never win the highest reward. O Janardana, endued with<br>energy and intelligence, these that have been born in our race think that<br>some one amongst them will at one time become the foremost amongst all<br>Kshatriyas. But, O exalted one, we also were all frightened by the fear<br>of Jarasandha and, O sinless one, by the wickedness of that monarch. O<br>thou invincible in battle, the might of thy arm is my refuge. When,<br>therefore, thou taken fright at Jarasandha's might, how should I regard<br>myself strong in comparison with him? Madhava, O thou of the Vrishni<br>race, I am repeatedly depressed by the thought whether Jarasandha is<br>capable or not of being slain by thee, by Rama, by Bhimasena, or by<br>Arjuna. But what shall I say, O Keshava? Thou art my highest authority on<br>everything.'<br><br>"On hearing these words, Bhima well-skilled in speech said,&#8212;'That king<br>who is without exertion, or who being weak and without resources entereth<br>into hostility with one that is strong, perisheth like an ant-hill. It<br>may be generally seen, however, that even a king that is weak may<br>vanquish an enemy that is strong and obtain the fruition of all his<br>wishes, by wakefulness and by the application of policy. In Krishna is<br>policy, in myself strength, in Arjuna triumphs. So like the three<br>(sacrificial) fires that accomplish a sacrifice, we shall accomplish the<br>death of the king of Magadha."<br><br>"Krishna then said,&#8212;'One that is immature in understanding seeketh the<br>fruition of his desire without an eye to what may happen to him in<br>future. It is seen that no one forgiveth for that reason a foe that is of<br>immature understanding and inclined to serve his own interests. It hath<br>been heard by us that in the krita age, having brought every one under<br>their subjection, Yauvanaswin by the abolition of all taxes, Bhagiratha<br>by his kind treatment to his subjects, Kartavirya by the energy of his<br>asceticism, the lord Bharata by his strength and valour, and Maruta by<br>his prosperity, all these five became emperors. But, O Yudhishthira, thou<br>who covetest the imperial dignity deserves it, not by one but by all<br>these qualities, viz., victory, protection afforded to thy people,<br>virtue, prosperity, and policy. Know, O bull of the Kuru race, that<br>Jarasandha, the son of Vrihadratha, is even such (i.e., a candidate for<br>the imperial dignity). A hundred dynasties of kings have become unable to<br>oppose Jarasandha. He, therefore, may be regarded to be an emperor for<br>his strength. Kings that are wearers of jewels worship Jarasandha (with<br>presents of jewels). But, wicked from his childhood, he is scarcely<br>satisfied with such worship. Having become the foremost among all, he<br>attacketh yet with violence kings with crowns on their heads. Nor is<br>there seen any king from whom he taketh not tribute. Thus hath he brought<br>under his sway nearly a hundred kings. How can, O son of Pritha, any weak<br>monarch approach him with hostile intentions? Confined in the temple of<br>Shiva and offered as sacrifice unto him like so many animals, do not<br>these monarchs dedicated unto that god feel the most poignant misery, O<br>bull of the Bharata race? A Kshatriya that dieth in battle is ever<br>regarded with respect. Why shall we not, therefore, meet together and<br>oppose Jarsandha in battle? He hath already brought eighty-six kings;<br>fourteen only are wanting to complete one hundred. As soon as he<br>obtaineth those fourteen, he will begin his cruel act. He that shall be<br>to obstruct that act will surely win blazing renown. And he that will<br>vanquish Jarasandha will surely become the emperor of all the<br>Kshatriyas.'"
