                            "Sisupala said&#8212;'O thou of the Kuru race, this one of the Vrishni race<br>doth not deserve royal worship as if he were a king, in the midst of all<br>these illustrious monarchs. O son of Pandu, this conduct of thine in thus<br>willingly worshipping him with eyes like lotus-petals is not worthy of<br>the illustrious Pandavas. Ye sons of Pandu. Ye are children. Ye know not<br>what morality is, for that is very subtle. Bhishma, this son also of<br>Ganga is of little knowledge and hath transgressed the rules of morality<br>(by giving ye such counsel). And, O Bhishma, if one like thee, possessed<br>of virtue and morality acteth from motives of interest, he is deserving<br>of censure among the honest and the wise. How doth he of the Dasarha<br>race, who is not even a king, accept worship before these kings and how<br>is it that he hath been worshipped by ye? O bull of the Kuru race, if<br>thou regardest Krishna as the oldest in age, here is Vasudeva, and how<br>can his son be said so in his presence? Or, if thou regardest Vasudeva as<br>your well-wisher and supporter, here is Drupada; how then can Madhava<br>deserve the (first) worship? Or, O son of Kuru, regardest thou Krishna as<br>preceptor? When Drona is here, how hast thou worshipped him of the<br>Vrishni race? Or, O son of Kuru, regardest thou Krishna as the Ritwija?<br>When old Dwaipayana is here, how hath Krishna been worshipped by thee?<br>Again when old Bhishma, the son of Santanu, that foremost of men who is<br>not to die save at his own wish is here, why, O king, hath Krishna been<br>worshipped by thee? When the brave Aswatthaman, versed in every branch of<br>knowledge is here, why, O king, hath Krishna, O thou of the Kuru race,<br>been worshipped by thee? When that King of kings, Duryyodhana, that<br>foremost of men, is here, as also Kripa the preceptor of the Bharata<br>princes, why hath Krishna been worshipped by thee? How, O son of Pandu,<br>passing over Druma, the preceptor of the Kimpurusas, hast thou worshipped<br>Krishna? When the invincible Bhishmaka and king Pandya possessed of every<br>auspicious mark, and that foremost of kings&#8212;Rukmi and Ekalavya and<br>Salya, the king of the Madras, are here, how, O son of Pandu, hast thou<br>offered the first worship unto Krishna? Here also is Karna ever boasting<br>of his strength amongst all kings, and (really) endued with great might,<br>the favourite disciple of the Brahmana Jamadagnya, the hero who<br>vanquished in battle all monarchs by his own strength alone. How, O<br>Bharata, hast thou, passing him over, offered the first worship unto<br>Krishna? The slayer of Madhu is neither a sacrificial priest nor a<br>preceptor, nor a king. That thou hast notwithstanding all these<br>worshipped him, O chief of the Kurus, could only have been from motives<br>of gain. If, O Bharata, it was your wish to offer the first worship unto<br>the slayer of Madhu, why were these monarchs brought here to be insulted<br>thus? We have not paid tributes to the illustrious son of Kunti from<br>fear, from desire of gain, or from having been won over by conciliation.<br>On the other hand, we have paid him tribute simply because he hath been<br>desirous of the imperial dignity from motives of virtue. And yet he it is<br>that thus insulteth us. O king, from what else, save motives of insult,<br>could it have been that thou hast worshipped Krishna, who possesseth not<br>the insignia of royalty, with the Arghya in the midst of the assembled<br>monarchs? Indeed, the reputation for virtue that the son of Dharma hath<br>acquired, hath been acquired by him without cause, for who would offer<br>such undue worship unto one that hath fallen off from virtue. This wretch<br>born in the race of the Vrishnis unrighteously slew of old the<br>illustrious king Jarasandha. Righteousness hath today been abandoned by<br>Yudhishthira and meanness only hath been displayed by him in consequence<br>of his having offered the Arghya to Krishna. If the helpless sons of<br>Kunti were affrighted and disposed to meanness, thou, O Madhava, ought to<br>have enlightened them as to thy claims to the first worship? Why also, O<br>Janarddana, didst thou accept the worship of which thou art unworthy,<br>although it was offered unto thee by those mean-minded princes? Thou<br>thinkest much of the worship unworthily offered unto thee, like a dog<br>that lappeth in solitude a quantity of clarified butter that it hath<br>obtained. O Janarddana, this is really no insult offered unto the<br>monarchs; on the other hand it is thou whom the Kurus have insulted.<br>Indeed, O slayer of Madhu, as a wife is to one that is without virile<br>power, as a fine show is to one that is blind, so is this royal worship<br>to thee who art no king. What Yudhishthira is, hath been seen; what<br>Bhishma is, hath been seen; and what this Vasudeva is hath been seen.<br>Indeed, all these have been seen as they are!"<br><br>"Having spoken these words, Sisupala rose from his excellent seat, and<br>accompanied by the kings, went out of that assembly."
