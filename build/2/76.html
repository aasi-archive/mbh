                            Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Then the vanquished sons of Pritha prepared for<br>their exile into the woods. And they, one after another, in due order,<br>casting off their royal robes, attired themselves in deer-skins. And<br>Dussasana, beholding those chastisers of foes, dressed in deer-skins and<br>deprived of their kingdom and ready to go into exile, exclaimed 'The<br>absolute sovereignty of the illustrious king Duryodhana hath commenced.<br>The sons of Pandu have been vanquished, and plunged into great<br>affliction. Now have we attained the goal either by broad or narrow<br>paths. For today becoming superior to our foes in point of prosperity as<br>also of duration of rule have we become praiseworthy of men. The sons of<br>Pritha have all been plunged by us into everlasting hell. They have been<br>deprived of happiness and kingdom for ever and ever. They who, proud of<br>their wealth, laughed in derision at the son of Dhritarashtra, will now<br>have to go into the woods, defeated and deprived by us of all their<br>wealth. Let them now put off their variegated coats of mail, their<br>resplendent robes of celestial make, and let them all attire themselves<br>in deer-skins according to the stake they had accepted of the son of<br>Suvala. They who always used to boast that they had no equals in all the<br>world, will now know and regard themselves in this their calamity as<br>grains of sesame without the kernel. Although in this dress of theirs the<br>Pandavas seem like unto wise and powerful persons installed in a<br>sacrifice, yet they look like persons not entitled to perform sacrifices,<br>wearing such a guise. The wise Yajnasena of the Somake race, having<br>bestowed his daughter&#8212;the princess of Panchala&#8212;on the sons of Pandu,<br>acted most unfortunately for the husbands of Yajnaseni&#8212;these sons of<br>Pritha are as eunuchs. And O Yajnaseni, what joy will be thine upon<br>beholding in the woods these thy husbands dressed in skins and<br>thread-bare rags, deprived of their wealth and possessions. Elect thou a<br>husband, whomsoever thou likest, from among all these present here. These<br>Kurus assembled here, are all forbearing and self-controlled, and<br>possessed of great wealth. Elect thou one amongst these as thy lord, so<br>that these great calamity may not drag thee to wretchedness. 'The sons of<br>Pandu now are even like grains of sesame without the kernel, or like<br>show-animals encased in skins, or like grains of rice without the kernel.<br>Why shouldst thou then longer wait upon the fallen sons of Pandu? Vain is<br>the labour used upon pressing the sesame grain devoid of the kernel!'<br><br>"Thus did Dussasana, the son of Dhritarashtra, utter in the hearing of<br>the Pandavas, harsh words of the most cruel import. And hearing them, the<br>unforbearing Bhima, in wrath suddenly approaching that prince like a<br>Himalayan lion upon a jackal, loudly and chastisingly rebuked him in<br>these words,&#8212;Wicked-minded villain, ravest thou so in words that are<br>uttered alone by the sinful? Boastest thou thus in the midst of the<br>kings, advanced as thou art by the skill of the king of Gandhara. As thou<br>piercest our hearts hear with these thy arrowy words, so shall I pierce<br>thy heart in battle, recalling all this to thy mind. And they also who<br>from anger or covetousness are walking behind thee as thy<br>protectors,&#8212;them also shall I send to the abode of Yama with their<br>descendants and relatives."<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;Unto Bhima dressed in deer-skins and uttering<br>these words of wrath without doing any thing, for he could not deviate<br>from the path of virtue, Dussasana abandoning all sense of shame, dancing<br>around the Kurus, loudly said, 'O cow! O cow!'<br><br>Bhima at this once more said,&#8212;Wretch darest thou, O Dussasana, use harsh<br>words as these? Whom doth it behove to boast, thus having won wealth by<br>foul means? I tell thee that if Vrikodara, the son of Pritha, drinketh<br>not thy life-blood, piercing open thy breast in battle, let him not<br>attain to regions of blessedness, I tell thee truly that by slaying the<br>sons of Dhritarashtra in battle, before the very eyes of all the<br>warriors, I shall pacify this wrath of mine soon enough.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"And as the Pandavas were going away from the<br>assembly, the wicked king Duryodhana from excess of joy mimiced by his<br>own steps the playful leonine trade of Bhima. Then Vrikodara, half<br>turning towards the king said, Think not ye fool that by this thou<br>gainest any ascendency over me slay thee shall I soon with all thy<br>followers, and answer thee, recalling all this to thy mind. And beholding<br>this insult offered to him, the mighty and proud Bhima, suppressing his<br>rising rage and following the steps of Yudhishthira, also spake these<br>words while going out of the Kaurava court, 'I will slay Duryodhana, and<br>Dhananjaya will slay Karna, and Sahadeva will slay Sakuni that gambler<br>with dice. I also repeat in this assembly these proud words which the<br>gods will assuredly make good, if ever we engage in battle with the<br>Kurus, I will slay this wretched Duryodhana in battle with my mace, and<br>prostrating him on the ground I will place my foot on his head. And as<br>regards this (other) wicked person&#8212;Dussasana who is audacious in speech,<br>I will drink his blood like a lion.<br><br>"And Arjuna said,&#8212;O Bhima, the resolutions of superior men are not known<br>in words only. On the fourteenth year from this day, they shall see what<br>happeneth.<br><br>"And Bhima again said,&#8212;'The earth shall drink the blood of Duryodhana,<br>and Karna, and the wicked Sakuni, and Dussasana that maketh the fourth.'<br><br>"And Arjuna said,&#8212;'O Bhima, I will, as thou directest, slay in battle<br>this Karna so malicious and jealous and harsh-speeched and vain. For<br>doing what is agreeable to Bhima, Arjuna voweth that he will slay in<br>battle with his arrows this Karna with all his followers. And I will send<br>unto the regions of Yama also all those other kings that will from<br>foolishness fight against me. The mountains of Himavat might be removed<br>from where they are, the maker of the day lose his brightness, the moon<br>his coldness, but this vow of mine will ever be cherished. And all this<br>shall assuredly happen if on the fourteenth year from this, Duryodhana<br>doth not, with proper respect, return us our kingdom.'"<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"After Arjuna had said this, Sahadeva the<br>handsome son of Madri, endued with great energy, desirous of slaying<br>Sakuni, waving his mighty arms and sighing like snake, exclaimed, with<br>eyes red with anger&#8212;'Thou disgrace of the Gandhara kings, those whom<br>thou thinkest as defeated are not really so. Those are even sharp-pointed<br>arrows from whose wounds thou hast run the risk in battle. I shall<br>certainly accomplish all which Bhima hath said adverting to thee with all<br>thy followers. If therefore thou hast anything to do, do it before that<br>day cometh. I shall assuredly slay thee in battle with all thy followers<br>soon enough, it thou, O son of Suvala, stayest in the light pursuant to<br>the Kshatriya usage.'<br><br>"'Then, O monarch hearing these words of Sahadeva, Nakula the handsomest<br>of men spake these words,&#8212;'I shall certainly send unto the abode of Yama<br>all those wicked sons of Dhritarashtra, who desirous of death and<br>impelled by Fate, and moved also by the wish of doing what is agreeable<br>to Duryodhana, have used harsh and insulting speeches towards this<br>daughter o Yajnasena at the gambling match. Soon enough shall I, at the<br>command of Yudhishthira and remembering the wrongs to Draupadi, make the<br>earth destitute of the sons of Dhritarashtra.'<br><br>Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;"And those tigers among men, all endued with<br>long arms, having thus pledged themselves to virtuous promises approached<br>king Dhritarashtra."
