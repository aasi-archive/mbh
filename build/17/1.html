                            Om! Having bowed down unto Narayana, and to Nara, the foremost of men, as<br>also to the goddess Sarasvati, should the word "Jaya" be uttered.<br><br>Janamejaya said: "Having heard of that encounter with iron bolts between<br>the heroes of the Vrishni and the Andhaka races, and having been informed<br>also of Krishnas ascension to Heaven, what did the Pandavas do?"<br><br>Vaishampayana said: "Having heard the particulars of the great slaughter<br>of the Vrishnis, the Kaurava king set his heart on leaving the world. He<br>addressed Arjuna, saying, O thou of great intelligence, it is Time that<br>cooks every creature (in his cauldron). I think that what has happened is<br>due to the cords of Time (with which he binds us all). It behoveth thee<br>also to see it.<br><br>"Thus addressed by his brother, the son of Kunti only repeated the word<br>Time, Time! and fully endorsed the view of his eldest brother gifted with<br>great intelligence. Ascertaining the resolution of Arjuna, Bhimasena and<br>the twins fully endorsed the words that Arjuna had said. Resolved to<br>retire from the world for earning merit, they brought Yuyutsu before<br>them. Yudhishthira made over the kingdom to the son of his uncle by his<br>Vaisya wife. Installing Parikshit also on their throne, as king, the<br>eldest brother of the Pandavas, filled with sorrow, addressed Subhadra,<br>saying, This son of thy son will be the king of the Kurus. The survivor<br>of the Yadus, Vajra, has been made a king. Parikshit will rule in<br>Hastinapura, while the Yadava prince, Vajra, will rule in Shakraprastha.<br>He should be protected by thee. Never set thy heart on unrighteousness.<br><br>"Having said these words, king Yudhishthira the just, along with his<br>brothers, promptly offered oblations of water unto Vasudeva of great<br>intelligence, as also unto his old maternal uncle and Rama and others. He<br>then duly performed the Sraddhas of all those deceased kinsmen of his.<br>The king, in honour of Hari and naming him repeatedly, fed the<br>Island-born Vyasa, and Narada, and Markandeya possessed of wealth of<br>penances, and Yajnavalkya of Bharadwajas race, with many delicious<br>viands. In honour of Krishna, he also gave away many jewels and gems, and<br>robes and clothes, and villages, and horses and cars, and female slaves<br>by hundreds and thousands unto foremost of Brahmanas. Summoning the<br>citizens. Kripa was installed as the preceptor and Parikshit was made<br>over to him as his disciple, O chief of Bharatas race.<br><br>"Then Yudhishthira once more summoned all his subjects. The royal sage<br>informed them of his intentions. The citizens and the inhabitants of the<br>provinces, hearing the kings words, became filled with anxiety and<br>disapproved of them. This should never be done, said they unto the king.<br>The monarch, well versed with the changes brought about by time, did not<br>listen to their counsels. Possessed of righteous soul, he persuaded the<br>people to sanction his views. He then set his heart on leaving the world.<br>His brothers also formed the same resolution. Then Dharmas son,<br>Yudhishthira, the king of the Kurus, casting off his ornaments, wore<br>barks of trees. Bhima and Arjuna and the twins, and Draupadi also of<br>great fame, similarly clad themselves in bark of trees, O king. Having<br>caused the preliminary rites of religion, O chief of Bharatas race, which<br>were to bless them in the accomplishment of their design, those foremost<br>of men cast off their sacred fires into the water. The ladies, beholding<br>the princes in that guise, wept aloud. They seemed to look as they had<br>looked in days before, when with Draupadi forming the sixth in number<br>they set out from the capital after their defeat at dice. The brothers,<br>however, were all very cheerful at the prospect of retirement.<br>Ascertaining the intentions of Yudhishthira and seeing the destruction of<br>the Vrishnis, no other course of action could please them then.<br><br>"The five brothers, with Draupadi forming the sixth, and a dog forming<br>the seventh, set out on their journey. Indeed, even thus did king<br>Yudhishthira depart, himself the head of a party of seven, from the city<br>named after the elephant. The citizen and the ladies of the royal<br>household followed them for some distance. None of them, however, could<br>venture to address the king for persuading him to give up his intention.<br>The denizens of the city then returned; Kripa and others stood around<br>Yuyutsu as their centre. Ulupi, the daughter of the Naga chief, O thou of<br>Kuntis race, entered the waters of Ganga. The princess Chitrangada set<br>out for the capital of Manipura. The other ladies who were the<br>grandmothers of Parikshit centered around him. Meanwhile the high-souled<br>Pandavas, O thou of Kurus race, and Draupadi of great fame, having<br>observed the preliminary fast, set out with their faces towards the east.<br>Setting themselves on Yoga, those high-souled ones, resolved to observe<br>the religion of Renunciation, traversed through various countries and<br>reached diverse rivers and seas. Yudhishthira, proceeded first. Behind<br>him was Bhima; next walked Arjuna; after him were the twins in the order<br>of their birth; behind them all, O foremost one of Bharatas race,<br>proceeded Draupadi, that first of women, possessed of great beauty, of<br>dark complexion, and endued with eyes resembling lotus petals. While the<br>Pandavas set out for the forest, a dog followed them.<br><br>"Proceeding on, those heroes reached the sea of red waters. Dhananjaya<br>had not cast off his celestial bow Gandiva, nor his couple of<br>inexhaustible quivers, actuated, O king, by the cupidity that attaches<br>one to things of great value. The Pandavas there beheld the deity of fire<br>standing before them like a hill. Closing their way, the god stood there<br>in his embodied form. The deity of seven flames then addressed the<br>Pandavas, saying, Ye heroic sons of Pandu, know me for the deity of fire.<br>O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, O Bhimasena that art a scorcher of foes, O<br>Arjuna, and ye twins of great courage, listen to what I say! Ye foremost<br>ones of Kurus race, I am the god of fire. The forest of Khandava was<br>burnt by me, through the puissance of Arjuna and of Narayana himself. Let<br>your brother Phalguna proceed to the woods after casting off Gandiva,<br>that high weapon. He has no longer any need of it. That precious discus,<br>which was with the high-souled Krishna, has disappeared (from the world).<br>When the time again comes, it will come back into his hands. This<br>foremost of bows, Gandiva, was procured by me from Varuna for the use of<br>Partha. Let it be made over to Varuna himself.<br><br>"At this, all the brothers urged Dhananjaya to do what the deity said. He<br>then threw into the waters (of the sea) both the bow and the couple of<br>inexhaustible quivers. After this, O chief of Bharatas race, the god of<br>the fire disappeared then and there. The heroic sons of Pandu next<br>proceeded with their faces turned towards the south. Then, by the<br>northern coast of the salt sea, those princes of Bharatas race proceeded<br>to the south-west. Turning next towards the west, they beheld the city of<br>Dwaraka covered by the ocean. Turning next to the north, those foremost<br>ones proceeded on. Observant of Yoga, they were desirous of making a<br>round of the whole Earth."
