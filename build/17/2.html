                            Vaishampayana said: "Those princes of restrained souls and devoted to<br>Yoga, proceeding to the north, beheld Himavat, that very large mountain.<br>Crossing the Himavat, they beheld a vast desert of sand. They then saw<br>the mighty mountain Meru, the foremost of all high-peaked mountains. As<br>those mighty ones were proceeding quickly, all rapt in Yoga, Yajnaseni,<br>falling of from Yoga, dropped down on the Earth. Beholding her fallen<br>down, Bhimasena of great strength addressed king Yudhishthira the just,<br>saying, O scorcher of foes, this princess never did any sinful act. Tell<br>us what the cause is for which Krishna has fallen down on the Earth!<br><br>"Yudhishthira said: O best of men, though we were all equal unto her she<br>had great partiality for Dhananjaya. She obtains the fruit of that<br>conduct today, O best of men."<br><br>Vaishampayana continued: "Having said this, that foremost one of Bharatas<br>race proceeded on. Of righteous soul, that foremost of men, endued with<br>great intelligence, went on, with mind intent on itself. Then Sahadeva of<br>great learning fell down on the Earth. Beholding him drop down, Bhima<br>addressed the king, saying, He who with great humility used to serve us<br>all, alas, why is that son of Madravati fallen down on the Earth?<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, He never thought anybody his equal in wisdom. It is<br>for that fault that this prince has fallen down.<br><br>Vaishampayana continued: "Having said this, the king proceeded, leaving<br>Sahadeva there. Indeed, Kuntis son Yudhishthira went on, with his<br>brothers and with the dog. Beholding both Krishna and the Pandava<br>Sahadeva fallen down, the brave Nakula, whose love for kinsmen was very<br>great, fell down himself. Upon the falling down of the heroic Nakula of<br>great personal beauty, Bhima once more addressed the king, saying, This<br>brother of ours who was endued with righteousness without incompleteness,<br>and who always obeyed our behests, this Nakula who was unrivalled for<br>beauty, has fallen down.<br><br>"Thus addressed by Bhimasena, Yudhishthira, said, with respect to Nakula,<br>these words: He was of righteous soul and the foremost of all persons<br>endued with intelligence. He, however, thought that there was nobody that<br>equalled him in beauty of person. Indeed, he regarded himself as superior<br>to all in that respect. It is for this that Nakula has fallen down. Know<br>this, O Vrikodara. What has been ordained for a person, O hero, must have<br>to be endured by him.<br><br>"Beholding Nakula and the others fall down, Pandus son Arjuna of white<br>steeds, that slayer of hostile heroes, fell down in great grief of heart.<br>When that foremost of men, who was endued with the energy of Shakra, had<br>fallen down, indeed, when that invincible hero was on the point of death,<br>Bhima said unto the king, I do not recollect any untruth uttered by this<br>high-souled one. Indeed, not even in jest did he say anything false. What<br>then is that for whose evil consequence this one has fallen down on the<br>Earth?<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, Arjuna had said that he would consume all our foes in<br>a single day. Proud of his heroism, he did not, however, accomplish what<br>he had said. Hence has he fallen down. This Phalguna disregarded all<br>wielders of bows. One desirous of prosperity should never indulge in such<br>sentiments."<br><br>Vaishampayana continued: "Having said so, the king proceeded on. Then<br>Bhima fell down. Having fallen down, Bhima addressed king Yudhishthira<br>the just, saying, O king, behold, I who am thy darling have fallen down.<br>For what reason have I dropped down? Tell me if thou knowest it.<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, Thou wert a great eater, and thou didst use to boast<br>of thy strength. Thou never didst attend, O Bhima, to the wants of others<br>while eating. It is for that, O Bhima, that thou hast fallen down.<br><br>"Having said these words, the mighty-armed Yudhishthira proceeded on,<br>without looking back. He had only one companion, the dog of which I have<br>repeatedly spoken to thee, that followed him now.
