                            Vaishampayana said: "Then Shakra, causing the firmament and the Earth to<br>be filled by a loud sound, came to the son of Pritha on a car and asked<br>him to ascend it. Beholding his brothers fallen on the Earth, king<br>Yudhishthira the just said unto that deity of a 1,000 eyes these words:<br>My brothers have all dropped down here. They must go with me. Without<br>them by me I do not wish to go to Heaven, O lord of all the deities. The<br>delicate princess (Draupadi) deserving of every comfort, O Purandara,<br>should go with us. It behoveth thee to permit this.<br><br>"Shakra said, Thou shalt behold thy brothers in Heaven. They have reached<br>it before thee. Indeed, thou shalt see all of them there, with Krishna.<br>Do not yield to grief, O chief of the Bharatas. Having cast off their<br>human bodies they have gone there, O chief of Bharatas race. As regards<br>thee, it is ordained that thou shalt go thither in this very body of<br>thine.<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, This dog, O lord of the Past and the Present, is<br>exceedingly devoted to me. He should go with me. My heart is full of<br>compassion for him.<br><br>"Shakra said, Immortality and a condition equal to mine, O king,<br>prosperity extending in all directions, and high success, and all the<br>felicities of Heaven, thou hast won today. Do thou cast off this dog. In<br>this there will be no cruelty.<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, O thou of a 1,000 eyes. O thou that art of righteous<br>behaviour, it is exceedingly difficult for one that is of righteous<br>behaviour to perpetrate an act that is unrighteous. I do not desire that<br>union with prosperity for which I shall have to cast off one that is<br>devoted to me.<br><br>"Indra said, There is no place in Heaven for persons with dogs. Besides,<br>the (deities called) Krodhavasas take away all the merits of such<br>persons. Reflecting on this, act, O king Yudhishthira the just. Do thou<br>abandon this dog. There is no cruelty in this.<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, It has been said that the abandonment of one that is<br>devoted is infinitely sinful. It is equal to the sin that one incurs by<br>slaying a Brahmana. Hence, O great Indra, I shall not abandon this dog<br>today from desire of my happiness. Even this is my vow steadily pursued,<br>that I never give up a person that is terrified, nor one that is devoted<br>to me, nor one that seeks my protection, saying that he is destitute, nor<br>one that is afflicted, nor one that has come to me, nor one that is weak<br>in protecting oneself, nor one that is solicitous of life. I shall never<br>give up such a one till my own life is at an end.<br><br>"Indra said, Whatever gifts, or sacrifices spread out, or libations<br>poured on the sacred fire, are seen by a dog, are taken away by the<br>Krodhavasas. Do thou, therefore, abandon this dog. By abandoning this dog<br>thou wilt attain to the region of the deities. Having abandoned thy<br>brothers and Krishna, thou hast, O hero, acquired a region of felicity by<br>thy own deeds. Why art thou so stupefied? Thou hast renounced everything.<br>Why then dost thou not renounce this dog? "Yudhishthira said, This is<br>well known in all the worlds that there is neither friendship nor enmity<br>with those that are dead. When my brothers and Krishna died, I was unable<br>to revive them. Hence it was that I abandoned them. I did not, however,<br>abandon them as long as they were alive. To frighten one that has sought<br>protection, the slaying of a woman, the theft of what belongs to a<br>Brahmana, and injuring a friend, each of these four, O Shakra, is I think<br>equal to the abandonment of one that is devoted."<br><br>Vaishampayana continued: "Hearing these words of king Yudhishthira the<br>just, (the dog became transformed into) the deity of Righteousness, who,<br>well pleased, said these words unto him in a sweet voice fraught with<br>praise.<br><br>"Dharma said: Thou art well born, O king of kings, and possessed of the<br>intelligence and the good conduct of Pandu. Thou hast compassion for all<br>creatures, O Bharata, of which this is a bright example. Formerly, O son,<br>thou wert once examined by me in the woods of Dwaita, where thy brothers<br>of great prowess met with (an appearance of) death. Disregarding both thy<br>brothers Bhima and Arjuna, thou didst wish for the revival of Nakula from<br>thy desire of doing good to thy (step-) mother. On the present occasion,<br>thinking the dog to be devoted to thee, thou hast renounced the very car<br>of the celestials instead of renouncing him. Hence. O king, there is no<br>one in Heaven that is equal to thee. Hence, O Bharata, regions of<br>inexhaustible felicity are thine. Thou hast won them, O chief of the<br>Bharatas, and thine is a celestial and high goal."<br><br>Vaishampayana continued: "Then Dharma, and Shakra, and the Maruts, and<br>the Ashvinis, and other deities, and the celestial Rishis, causing<br>Yudhishthira to ascend on a car, proceeded to Heaven. Those beings<br>crowned with success and capable of going everywhere at will, rode their<br>respective cars. King Yudhishthira, that perpetuator of Kurus race,<br>riding on that car, ascended quickly, causing the entire welkin to blaze<br>with his effulgence. Then Narada, that foremost of all speakers, endued<br>with penances, and conversant with all the worlds, from amidst that<br>concourse of deities, said these words: All those royal sages that are<br>here have their achievements transcended by those of Yudhishthira.<br>Covering all the worlds by his fame and splendour and by his wealth of<br>conduct, he has attained to Heaven in his own (human) body. None else<br>than the son of Pandu has been heard to achieve this.<br><br>"Hearing these words of Narada, the righteous-souled king, saluting the<br>deities and all the royal sages there present, said, Happy or miserable,<br>whatever the region be that is now my brothers, I desire to proceed to. I<br>do not wish to go anywhere else.<br><br>"Hearing this speech of the king, the chief of the deities, Purandara,<br>said these words fraught with noble sense: Do thou live in this place, O<br>king of kings, which thou hast won by thy meritorious deeds. Why dost<br>thou still cherish human affections? Thou hast attained to great success,<br>the like of which no other man has ever been able to attain. Thy<br>brothers, O delighter of the Kurus, have succeeded in winning regions of<br>felicity. Human affections still touch thee. This is Heaven. Behold these<br>celestial Rishis and Siddhas who have attained to the region of the gods.<br><br>"Gifted with great intelligence, Yudhishthira answered the chief of the<br>deities once more, saying, O conqueror of Daityas, I venture not to dwell<br>anywhere separated from them. I desire to go there, where my brothers<br>have gone. I wish to go there where that foremost of women, Draupadi, of<br>ample proportions and darkish complexion and endued with great<br>intelligence and righteous of conduct, has gone."<br><br>The end of Mahaprasthanika-parv
