                    The Mahabharata is an ancient Sanskrit epic, and one of the two great epics of India.
                    It narrates the events of the Great War at Kurukshetra, that leads to the manifestation of
                    Lord Krishna on Earth, delivering the Srimad Bhagvad Gita (the Song of the Lord). It is one
                    of the longest texts in existence, containing over 200,000 individual verses,
                    with 18,00,000+ words, it is ten times the length of Illiad and Odyssey combined.<br><br>

                    This website hosts the English translation of the Mahabharata. This humongous work was not
                    done by me, of course, as I only stand on the shoulders of giants. The original translation was
                    done by Kisari Mohan Ganguli (KMG, for short), and was digitized in a joint effort between
                    <a href="https://sacred-texts.com">Sacred-Texts</a> and <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project
                        Gutenberg</a>.<br><br>

                    <b>The KMG translation of the Mahabharata remains the only complete public domain translation in
                        existence.</b><br><br>

                    Books 1-4 were proofed at Distributed Proofing (Juliet Sutherland, Project Manager), from page
                    images scanned at
                    sacred-texts.com. Books 5-7 and 12-15 were scanned and proofed at sacred-texts.com by John Bruno
                    Hare.
                    Books 8-11 and 16-18 were scanned and proofed by Mantra Caitanya.<br><br>

                    My work has largely been on turning the plaintext files into beautiful HTML, and writing a search
                    indexer for the scripture to be searched for any particular sequence of words.<br><br>

                    Many of the images here are created by the wonderful Italian artist Giampaolo Tomasetti. You can
                    find
                    them in full resolution from this website: <a
                        href="http://www.mahabharata.bg">http://www.mahabharata.bg/</a>. The site is
                    in Bulgarian, you may need to Google Translate it. It would be unfair for me to not say parts of
                    this website
                    are inspired from it.<br><br>
